WHY IT MATTERS

Alfred Health will use the 3M 360 Encompass System to integrate and automate CDI medical records clinical coding and performance monitoring across all its facilities. 3M's CDI and coding system is currently used by over 2000 healthcare organisations across the US Canada and Europe.

The technology will enable the hospital to improve query and monitor documentation for optimal coded data ""increasing coding productivity appropriate diagnosis-related group capture and reimbursement and actionable data to support the improvement of patient outcomes"" 3M said in a statement.

The CDI and coding system will also be integrated with Alfred Health's Cerner EMR record system to fix the inefficiencies of having multiple coding documentation query workflows and additional costs and burden of disconnected systems.

According to 3M its solution promotes the complete capture of patient complexity in clinical documentation and coding ""to accurately reflect case-mix and significantly reduce the time and resources needed to effectively collaborate across multiple workstreams.""

""With 3M Codefinder as its foundation 3M 360 Encompass System incorporates all of the current Australian ICD-10-AM/ACHI/ACS coding content rules and functionality that have been developed with customers' input over the past 30 years"" the company said.

Besides the 360 Encompass System 3M will also deploy its Business Process Advisory Service a computer-assisted physician documentation solution called 3MTM CDI EngageTM along with the 3MTM Advanced CDI Program a CDI consulting and education programme.

THE LARGER TREND

In March US-based Michigan Medicine contracted 3M to improve its clinical electronic health record documentation. The suite of AI-powered solutions including the 360 Encompass System is being integrated across its three hospitals and 125 clinical systems.

The next month saw 3M launching a new platform to enable healthcare providers and payers to prioritise care for high-risk populations. The company said in a statement that the platform combines clinical social and population health data to create a complete picture of patient health.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5ld3MvZW50cmVwZW5ldXItd2hvLXN0YXJ0ZWQtYnVzaW5lc3MtbG9ja2Rvd24tMjQxNjcwOTjSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1uZXdzL2VudHJlcGVuZXVyLXdoby1zdGFydGVkLWJ1c2luZXNzLWxvY2tkb3duLTI0MTY3MDk4LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Entrepeneur who started business in lockdown to help mum's arthritis now turning over £3m,"Mark Shephard from Altrincham is about to see his business launch in Australia and America and has seen sales skyrocket with 40000 customers in less than a year

Entrepeneur who started business in lockdown to help mum's arthritis now turning over £3m

A savvy entrepreneur who launched a ""game-changing"" product to help his elderly mother with her arthritis has turned over £3million in just a year.

Mark Shephard 55 started Reverse Life a collagen drink company last May and is now about to head onto the stock exchange.

The business has already made £3m in turnover with more than 40000 customers nationally - but Mark from Altrincham says it was never about the money.

He first got the idea when medication prescribed for his mother Judith who is in her late 70s didn't seem to help with her swollen joints.

Judith suffers from osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and Mark was determined to find a solution to the problem.

He started to research alternative solutions in an attempt to make things easier for her to walk around - that's when he came across collagen.

“I told my mum that I needed to try and find something to help her” he told Manchester Evening News.

“I spoke to numerous doctors and specialists and they kept mentioning that people over the age of 40 start losing collagen and that will result in weakened skin and bones.

“So I started looking into it and managed to find some collagen for my mum.

""Three weeks after using it she said she wasn’t sure if it was a placebo effect or not but she started feeling better.”

He started passing round bottles to his mum’s friends and other elderly people in the local community and they all started to saying the same thing - their skin felt improved and they noticed a change in their hair and nails.

Already in business as a co-founder of PPI company The Genius Group Mark thought he could be onto a good thing.

Alongside work partner Chris Niebel he came up with Reverse Life and the business was born.

“A lot of people said it was pretty crazy of us to be starting a business while we’re in lockdown” Mark explains.

“But my argument was that we’re providing something to the people who can’t go to see the doctor and can’t go to see the beauty therapist because of the lockdown and shielding.

“In a way it really was the perfect time to start this.”

The product features a ‘magic formula’ of 10000mg of marine collagen which is said to aid with skin strength alongside minimising wrinkles and elasticity.

Almost overnight the product proved to be a runaway success. Within the first two months they had already sold £100000 worth of products and were constantly selling out of stock.

Set to launch in Australia and America in the next few months Reverse Life is now also set to appear on the stock market with an evaluation in the millions.

“Just this week we’ve been approached to float on the stock market - it’s an unbelievable evaluation and we’re over the moon” Mark adds.

“In a few month’s time this tiny Manchester business is going to be on the stock exchange.

“We’ve been told that when Virgin Wines floated on the market for £100m they had 120000 clients and an average client value of £220. Our average client value is more than that in just six months with over 40000 clients.

“We’re expecting to be a £100 m company in the next 12 months from now. It’s unheard of.”

During the height of the pandemic and as Reverse Life was just finding its feet Mark and Chris donated 5000 Covid test kits to doctors and nurses working in Manchester hospitals.

Mark says it was a part of his ethos of not standing around and waiting for change to come. “We’re a tiny company in the speck of it but I felt we needed to do something” he says.

“I know nurses were crying their eyes out saying they were terrified of going into work. We paid for the kits and got them independently tested.

“I’ve spoken to billionaires and asked them to help and they’ve just turned round and said it’s not their problem it’s not their issue.

“To say that it wasn’t their problem when surely someone in their family will need to go to hospital at some point was really shocking to hear.

“I’ve always been brought up to be a parallel universe kind of person so I couldn’t just sit back and do nothing. I guess that’s how the business started as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjMwMTA4OS9hYm91dC0zbS1pbi1wYWtpc3Rhbi1sYWNraW5nLWlkcy1tYXktbWlzcy1vdXQtb24tY292aWQtMTktamFic9IBaWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjMwMTA4OS9hYm91dC0zbS1pbi1wYWtpc3Rhbi1sYWNraW5nLWlkcy1tYXktbWlzcy1vdXQtb24tY292aWQtMTktamFicz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,About 3m in Pakistan lacking IDs may miss out on Covid-19 jabs,"Unregistered refugees some locals likely to be excluded from campaign due to prove-your-identity condition

A prove-your-identity condition may leave 3 million people in Pakistan without coronavirus vaccines including mainly unregistered refugees jeopardizing the country's fight against the pandemic.

Currently only Pakistani nationals or immigrants who have either computerized national identification cards (CNIC) or official refugee status can receive the jabs.

The country of over 207 million people has so far vaccinated nearly 3 million people a ratio well below that of neighbouring India.

Over 1.5 million unregistered refugees living in Pakistan particularly from neighbouring Afghanistan will miss out on the vaccination for not having identity documents.

Besides thousands of CNIC have been blocked in recent years by the country's registration authority the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) for different reasons.

There are around 2.8 million documented and undocumented Afghan refugees in Pakistan making it the world's second-largest refugee population after Syrians in Turkey.

Only around half of the refugees are registered with the rest living undocumented mostly in northeastern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces which borders the war-torn Afghanistan.

The southern Sindh province of which the commercial hub Karachi is the capital also hosts nearly 500000 Afghan refugees.

UN suggest that more than 3.8 million refugees have been repatriated to Afghanistan since 2002. However many have returned to Pakistan due to ongoing violence unemployment and lack of education and medical facilities.

Apart from Afghan refugees the South Asian country and mainly Karachi has a sizable population of unregistered Bengali Nepali and Rohingya immigrants.

As per the current procedure citizens before being vaccinated must register themselves by sending their CNIC numbers to a designated official portal.

When asked about any alternative ways to get vaccinated for unregistered refugees or citizens who do not have the CNIC Faisal Sultan the prime minister’s special assistant on health affairs told Anadolu Agency that the refugees with ""Proof of Registration (PoR)"" cards issued by the Pakistani government were allowed to get vaccinated.

In the brief message he did not respond to a query about an alternative way for unregistered refugees.

Dangerous move

The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) a nationwide body of health professionals has demanded that the registration process be halted because it ""may deprive millions of people"" of COVID-19 vaccines.

""We have long been demanding that unnecessary conditions for vaccination will discourage millions to get vaccinated"" Dr Qaisar Sajjad the PMA's secretary-general told Anadolu Agency.

According to Qaisar around 3 million locals and refugees would not be eligible to receive vaccinations under the current system.

The large numbers of Afghan Bengali Nepali and Rohingya refugees will not be the only ones unable to get vaccinated against the highly contagious COVID-19. So will a significant number of the country's own citizens mostly those living in rural areas and who have not yet obtained a CNIC he said.

""It will simply tatter the benefits of the large-scale vaccination and the relentless efforts of the health professionals if such a huge portion of the population is not vaccinated just because they do not have identity cards"" Sajjad opined.

""To achieve the goal we have to vaccinate every single adult. The government must remove this [identity card] condition and simply let everyone get vaccinated"" he maintained.

Identity condition be revoked

Zahir Pashtun who works for a non-governmental organization dedicated to refugee welfare supported the call to remove the identification card requirement for vaccinations.

""The government has included the Afghan refugees with PoRs in the vaccination program ... a welcome step. However nearly half of the refugees in Pakistan are unregistered. They should be vaccinated"" Pashtun told Anadolu Agency.

Echoing Pashtun's views Noor Mohammad Arakani the head of the Rohingya Solidarity Forum that works for the welfare of the group displaced from Myanmar said: ""A large number of Rohingyas still don't have refugee identification cards. The government should either remove this condition or announce an alternative vaccination program.""

""Even among those who have identification cards the vaccination rate is still very low. The card condition will further sink this ratio"" he told Anadolu Agency.

Karachi is home to more than 400000 Rohingya Muslims -- often referred to as Burmese -- the highest number after Myanmar and now Bangladesh -- unofficial estimates suggest.

The Chief Commissioner for Afghan Refugees Saleem Khan said the government could not do anything for ""faceless"" refugees.

He told Anadolu Agency that the problem would have been resolved automatically if the refugees had registered with the government. They can still register with the government but the ""problem is that they are faceless"" according to Khan.

However he underlined that nearly 850000 Afghans with Afghan citizen cards have been included in the ongoing vaccination drive.

UNHCR Spokesman Qaiser Khan Afridi said the inclusion of registered Afghan refugees in the country's vaccination program was a ""positive step.""

In some parts of the country he added Afghan refugees who meet the criteria for receiving the jab have already started to register themselves and some of them have received their first vaccine dose.

Nonetheless unregistered refugees are not covered by the UNHCR's mandate he added.

""The virus doesn't know whether an individual is a refugee or a local. It is a challenge to everyone. Nobody is safe until all of us are safe” Afridi told Anadolu Agency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3R0aXNoc3VuLmNvLnVrL2ZhYnVsb3VzL2Zvb2QvNzE1MjU4Ny90aGUtcXVlZW4tYmFsbW9yYWwtZ2luLWJhbGxvY2hidWllL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3R0aXNoc3VuLmNvLnVrL2ZhYnVsb3VzL2Zvb2QvNzE1MjU4Ny90aGUtcXVlZW4tYmFsbW9yYWwtZ2luLWJhbGxvY2hidWllL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Queen launches posh gin made in Balmoral with regal price tag...,"BOTTOMS UP The Queen launches posh gin made in Balmoral with regal price tag

Greg Abbott.

Hughs was appointed by Abbott in 2019 but never received a required confirmation vote by the state Senate and must step down when the legislative session ends according to the state Constitution.

Hughs' resignation is effective May 31 the final day of the session.

Senate Nominations Committee Chair Dawn Buckingham's office declined comment to The Texas Tribune on why Hughs' nomination was never considered. Buckingham's chief of staff Aaron Harris also declined comment to The Associated Press.

Hughs' resignation comes as Texas is on course to become the nation's largest state to tighten restrictions on voting.

What exactly that legislation will say is not clear as it is in the hands of a bipartisan committee tasked with reaching a compromise on the final language.

In her letter to Abbott dated Thursday Hughs a lawyer expressed gratitude for her appointment and said only that the time is right for her to step down.

""I am proud of what we have accomplished and recognize this is the right time to transition and turn my attention to private practice"" Hughs wrote.

Hughs was appointed to replace former Secretary of State David Whitley who resigned in May 2019 amid backlash for wrongly questioning the U.S. citizenship of nearly 100000 voters.

Abbott released a statement on her resignation saying:

""Throughout her time as Secretary of State Ruth has been a faithful servant to the people of Texas and I thank her for her commitment to our state. Ruth's exceptional leadership has helped strengthen the Texas brand on the international stage and grow our businesses and trade relationships around the world.

Last Man Standing Cast Changes Over the Years View Gallery 5 Images

We’re of course talking about Mike and Vanessa’s first grandchild Boyd previously played by twins Evan and Luke Kruntchev (in Season 1) Flynn Morrison (in Seasons 2-6) and most recently Jet Jurgensmeyer (in Seasons 7-8). Kristin and Ryan’s son was last seen during Season 8’s gender reveal party where it was confirmed that Boyd would soon have a baby sister. After that the character was referenced only by name — and sparingly at that.

So why’d he disappear?

RELATED | Last Man Standing Considered Bringing Back OG Mandy and Kristin for Final Season — Here’s Why It Didn’t Happen

“We have such a great cast and it’s a big cast” Abbott tells TVLine. “Every week we struggle to give all the characters something to do and another regular just eats up real estate. There are only so many lines in a show and if Boyd was saying them then somebody else wasn’t and we just didn’t have a ton of Boyd storylines. They were parenting stories [about] Ryan and Kristin trying to involve Mike and we’d done a lot of them. We didn’t have any [new] ideas and you can’t just say ‘Hey actor! You who have been a regular will you just pop in whenever I need you?’ That’s pretty insulting and Jet was great.”

More often than not Boyd storylines left Ryan and Kristin on opposing sides of an argument “and we decided that we didn’t want to do stories where they were at odds because [of how their relationship started]” Abbott says. “It was so contentious and so difficult at the beginning [because Ryan had abandoned Kristin when Boyd was born]. That always hovered over any arguments and we felt like they had put that to rest… We wanted to show them as united you know? As a solid couple.”

And so the “hard decision” was made not to show Boyd at all — or to put it a different way “We took the Everybody Loves Raymond model” Abbott says. “‘The twins are upstairs!'”

TVLine readers gave Last Man Standing‘s May 20 series finale — and the Fox era as a whole — an average grade of “B+.”"

It didn't work at least not in the way J&J might have hoped.

Though Stelara measured up to AbbVie's leading med it failed to top Humira in any efficacy measure in the study called Seavue.

At the 52-week mark 64.9% of Stelara patients had hit clinical remission compared with 61% of patients taking Humira—a numerical difference but not a statistically significant one.

While the trial didn’t chalk up a win for Stelara “we are very happy with the outcome” said Jan Wehkamp M.D. vice president gastroenterology disease area leader at J&J's Janssen unit.

“Of course we always want our drugs to be the best” Wehkamp said in an interview. But the outcome of the Seavue trial which Janssen presented at this year’s virtual Digestive Disease Week showed both Stelara an IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor and Humira a TNF-alpha inhibitor performed a “little bit better than expected” he said.

Digging deeper into the data Stelara charted numerical wins on secondary endpoints but none were statistically significant. Around 61% of patients on the J&J drug hit corticosteroid-free remission versus 57.4% of Humira patients. Around 6% more patients on Stelara achieved clinical response than those on Humira and self-reported symptom remission was around 1% higher in the Stelara arm.

RELATED: The top 10 ad spenders in Big Pharma for 2020

Meanwhile Humira helped around 3% more patients hit clinical remission by Week 16. It also fared slightly better than Stelara at helping certain patients achieve endoscopic remission.

To hear Wehkamp tell it though there is a safety difference in Stelara's favor. Crohn’s disease patients need treatment for 60 years on average he said so long-term tolerability is very important. Specifically 6.3% of Stelara patients and 11.3% of Humira patients stopped treatment during Seavue because of side effects.

So what should doctors do now that they have these data? “For me the question is very simple: What would I choose if I could?” said Wehkamp.

If a patient has that choice—and they’ve never received a biologic drug for their Crohn's as was the case in the Seavue trial—""I would take the safer drug” he said. “There’s no other opinion in the field that IL-12/IL-23 is safer compared to anti-TNFs” Wehkamp added.

RELATED: Doctors 'highly positive' on AbbVie's Rinvoq in IBD but not so much on Bristol Myers' Zeposia: analyst

That safety edge could play in Stelara’s favor as it wrangles with Humira Humira biosims and next-gen Crohn’s contenders in the coming years. Humira biosimilars have already stormed the market in Europe and the first are due to hit the scene in the U.S. starting in 2023.

Then again that choice may not be a patient's to make as Wehkamp pointed out; payers tend to favor the cheaper drug and it's yet unknown what sorts of discounts drugmakers will offer for Humira biosims.

In the face of branded competition though J&J has already been dropping Stelara's price. The med’s “implied price” fell 19% in 2020’s third quarter versus the same period in 2019 and was flat versus the second quarter of 2020 Bernstein analysts wrote to clients last fall blaming AbbVie’s next-gen psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis meds Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Stelara sales swelled 14.7% to $1.95 billion for the same the period.

As far as other Crohn's upstarts are concerned a wave of additional IL-23 inhibitors are now in the running like AbbVie’s Skyrizi Eli Lilly’s mirikizumab AstraZeneca’s brazikumab and J&J’s own Tremfya which boasts green lights in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as AbbVie’s Rinvoq and Gilead’s Jyseleca are also making a play at the field but “systemic JAKS do have some serious black box warnings” Wehkamp pointed out.

Pfizer’s JAK inhibitor Xeljanz approved in ulcerative colitis was slapped with a black box warning in July over increased risk of blood clots and potential death with the drug’s 10-mg twice daily dose. It’s now approved only for patients who don’t respond to or are unsuitable for other treatments. The FDA last year also warned of an increased risk of serious infections malignancy and thrombosis from AbbVie’s rheumatoid arthritis med Rinvoq which is also angling for a spot in the GI market.

Stelara went on the ascent last year with sales climbing nearly 20% to $7.94 billion. Toward the end of 2019 the drug widened its GI foothold with a green light in ulcerative colitis.

The agreement (NDA) presented to moderators working for Covalen - a division of the CPL group and one of two companies along with Accenture providing outsourced moderators to Facebook - “reminds” them that their “confidentiality obligations will survive termination of employment”.

A copy of such an NDA seen by the Irish Examiner states that moderators must “keep all information concerning the company its customers third parties and any other connected organisation(s) absolutely confidential which includes avoiding divulging confidential information to any members of the public or family members”.

“Any deliberate breach of confidentiality may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal” the agreement states adding that the use of mobile phones during training “is strictly prohibited”.

“By signing this agreement you expressly acknowledge and agree that you have carefully read it and fully understands (sic) what it means” it concludes.

The use of non disclosure agreements with content moderators has come in for criticism in recent weeks due to the alleged “chilling effect” in the words of Fionnuala Ni Bhrogain of the Communications Workers Union they have on employees asserting their labour rights.

A spokesperson for the company said:

“As with every other commercial organisation Covalen requires sensitive business information to remain confidential.”

They added that all prospective Covalen employees are expected to sign an NDA and return it by email before commencing their role.

“Therefore the impression that employees do not receive a copy of such agreements is completely inaccurate and untrue” they said regarding allegations that employees have not been able to see the NDAs they have signed.

Content moderators are used by all social media companies to sift through potentially unacceptable content and flag same as inappropriate for publication. Such content can include the depiction of bullying hate speech graphic violence death and child exploitation. Video sharing app TikTok recently became the first social media outlet to offer moderators full contracts of employment.

Outsourced moderators in Facebook’s case are typically paid a deal less than direct employees of the tech giant. Facebook employs some 15000 such moderators around the world.

One such worker Irish woman Isabella Plunkett recently told an Oireachtas committee of the “horrible lucid dreams” she had experienced as a result of her work. She said she has been “taking anti-depressants for months… because of the content”.

Foxglove a legal non-profit representing moderators in their quest for better working conditions this week wrote to Tánaiste Leo Varadkar stating that the assertion that those workers have full access to their own NDAs “appears to us to be misleading”.

“Multiple moderators have reported signing documents that they were not sent copies of” that letter states. “If this practice has changed in response to queries from the news media we welcome this modest reform” it says adding that outsourcing companies should be “asked to confirm on the record that content moderators have the right to speak publicly about workplace conditions without fear of reprisal”.

Mr Varadkar the Minister for Enterprise told the same Oireachtas committee that the Health and Safety Authority “has its role” when it comes to the working conditions of content moderators.

“It is a job which humans have to do and a human brain has human emotions” he said adding that while he hasn’t met with Facebook in recent months it is something he would “take an interest in going forward”.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You can still play Flash content in your browser in 2021 but also using various tools e.g. the Flash games preservation project or Internet sites. Many of these use ruffle a Flash emulator. While not perfect it works with many games and applications already.

The Flash Game Archive is another tool for Windows to play classic Flash games. The latest version supports more than 4000 games all neatly categorized in the application. The app has a size of just 50 Megabytes as games are downloaded on demand.

The program launches in a windowed fullscreen mode which is a bit hard to navigate. You may set the desired screen resolution in the interface browse game categories newest additions or a featured listing.

Note that the app includes adult content but that the content is locked by a password.

You may browse all games from the categories page; there you find categories such as tower defense brain shooting or RPG. A click opens the list of games in the selected category. Each game is listed with its name initially.

Select a game to display a screenshot and to get some information e.g. a description or its version. The information is not available for all games though.

Select the play button to download the game and to start playing it. Flash Game Archive supports several Flash versions with Flash 13 preselected. If a game is not working you may need to change the Flash version to see if that does the trick.

Games play in a dedicated window and you may allow the Flash version to communicate with the Internet as some games won't work if you disallow it.

You may add games to the favorites for faster access in the future. A search is provided but it is only useful if you are looking for a particular game or want to find games by tags.

As far as the selection of games is concerned you find trashy but also well polished games supported. The Tower Defense category for example lists games such as Cursed Treasure or Viking Defense which used to be very popular back in the Flash gaming days.

Closing words

Flash Game Archive lets you play more than 4000 Flash games on your Windows PCs at the time of writing. It does not use emulation but ""real"" Flash versions for that it seems. While these won't get installed permanently on the system it still means that Flash is run on the device when games are played.

Now You: do you use a program or site to play Flash games?

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc's (AMD) chief executive officer Dr. Lisa Su received roughly 732 million votes in favor of her remaining on the company's board of directors. The votes were cast as part of AMD's annual shareholder meeting which took place on Wednesday and Dr. Su along with other board members was up for re-election as an AMD director. In addition to the board of directors' election other items on the agenda included approving executive compensation and securing the appointment of AMD's accounting firm.

AMD Chief's Overwhelming Support Eclipses Other Company Board Members During Election

Up for re-election to AMD's board on Wednesday were all current members with the longest-serving member being John Caldwell who is also AMD's chairman. Once the voting was over the results shared by AMD with the SEC yesterday reveal that Dr. Su managed to secure the highest number of votes as only a hairline percentage of the voters chose to vote against her.

The results reveal that the AMD chief managed to secure roughly 732 million votes 18 million more than Mr. John Marren who has been on the board since 2017 and is responsible for AMD's Audit and Finance and Corporate Governance Committees.

Additionally only 1.7 million shareholders voted against Dr. Su's appointment a figure vastly smaller than the 18 million votes against Mr. Marren's appointment. They also pale when compared to the 151 million votes against the re-appointment of Mr. Abhi Y. Talwalkar who has been serving on the board since 2017.

Dr. Su's appointment came as AMD announced a $4 billion share buyback program on Wednesday which is the first such announcement from the company since 2001. It marks management confidence in its current capital allocation hinting that AMD believes that it has sufficient capital to fund its growth and repurchase its shares for the first time in two decades.

Commenting on the repurchase Dr. Su stated during the shareholder meeting that:

Yeah you know we're very pleased with the progress that we've made in the business over the last few years. And it's really been a multi-year growth strategy and I know many of you have been with us on this journey. Based on our very strong financial results and the cash generation that we see going forward this is enabling us to you know first as I said our first priority is to invest significantly in the business. We see significant growth opportunities across our business portfolio. But it is the right time to start the return of capital to our shareholders and we think this share repurchase program is the right thing to do. This is the next step in our capital allocation strategy and will enable us to limit dilution from share issuances as well as reduce share count over time. And so we'll continue to evaluate what the best capital allocation strategy is over time. But we're very excited to be able to start the return of capital to our shareholders.

The results of AMD's latest shareholder meeting as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

During the shareholder meeting the executive also commented on the strained semiconductor supply chains and her company's response.

Dr. Su outlined that:

So yes there are some overall tightness in the supply chain for semiconductors. We had a very strong start of the year and we have strong visibility working with our customers as well as our supply chain in terms of what's available. So yes you know we do have commitments to meet the 50% annual revenue growth in 2021. We're continuing to work with our supply chain partners and customers every day to make sure we're satisfying their needs and we have excellent partnerships with our wafer suppliers you know TSMC and GlobalFoundries as well as our manufacturing partners across the ecosystem. So you know we continue to work closely with them. Overall I would say channel inventories are still low in the supply chain and so we're continuing to work with our partners to ramp overall capacity as there's quite a bit more that we would like to do.

AMD procures all of its latest semiconductor products from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). TSMC which operates out of Taiwan is currently navigating through a historic drought in the island and operating at full capacity to meet automakers' demand following a shortage spurred by the ongoing pandemic.

Dr. Su for her part remains optimistic about her company's future as she believes that AMD's strong product portfolio will help it weather any future demand drops in the consumer electronics sector. In contrast the need for products such as notebooks and smartphones has been higher due to remote working and distance learning some worry that device makers will have excess inventory on their hands when things settle down.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This quaint hobbit home is available in the South Okanagan through AirBNB. Image Credit: SUBMITTED/AIRBNB

The Okanagan homage to middle earth that doubles as a popular Airbnb spot officially has a new name.

It’s now the Second Breakfast Hideaway.

“And the h***** mountain hole is now a Second Breakfast Hideaway (I'm still full from the first one)” the AirBNB owners wrote in a May 22 post.

“Thank you to everyone who voted and to @arikanacres for the suggestion. I had a lot of fun with it I hope you did too and thanks to everyone for the coolest name suggestions and kind words and really totally overwhelming and unexpected support far and wide.”

The popular Airbnb named for its likeness to the housing in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of Rings books went on the hunt for a new name following a threat from Warner Bros. which owns the trademark to the word hobbit.

Christine Le Combe and her husband purchased the Halfling Hideaway located roughly 30 minutes east of Osoyoos last year and renamed it the Hobbit Mountain Hideaway. It's been a popular vacation destination since it opened in 2019.

Earlier this week Le Combe was contacted by entertainment media company Warner Bros. and was told the word “hobbit” is trademarked and they asked her to take down the listing.

Instead she pivoted and asked her Instagram followers to vote on a new name.

“Having to get out of my comfort zone and engage with the community has been a good experience” Le Combe said.

“I really didn’t think that somebody would copyright the word hobbit and then try to hunt a person down if they use the word hobbit because it’s not like I meant any harm. The hobbit house is an homage to the favourite book series of a lot of people.”

Nothing has been affected other than the name.

The Glass House at 311 Hargrave St. is a 200-suite condo in the heart of downtown Winnipeg but for some residents the condo is starting to feel like a hotel.

Vice president of the condo board Sinan Leylek said there are several Airbnb units surrounding his suite and there’s been a steady rotation of people coming in and out to use them for short-term stays.

“When bars were closing earlier in October people would come back and continue drinking and partying despite orders to stay home as much as possible” said Leylek.

Leylek said short-term renters have been responsible for multiple incidents in the building including false fire alarms and calls to 911.

Craig Penner—another condo owner in the building—has been having similar issues.

“People refusing to wear masks coming into the building getting into the elevator as well as parties break out into fights that spill outside your front door” said Penner.

Penner said the condo doesn’t have the authority to enforce public health orders.

Tuesday at an Executive Policy Committee meeting Coun. Markus Chambers drafted a motion calling for more regulations and taxation in the short term rental industry.

“Maybe limiting (short-term rentals) to your primary residence so that you’re not buying up multiple suites or multiple homes and running them as ghost hotels” said Chambers.

Chambers said the motion was supported unanimously by council.

The province of Manitoba said no provincial regulations are needed under the condo act it says the condo board has the power to create by-laws that would ban short-term rentals.

It said under the Residential Tenancies Act a tenant or person a tenant permits into a residential complex must not engage in unlawful activity must not damage units or the building and must not interfere with the enjoyment of other occupants.

In a statement to CTV a spokesperson for Airbnb said:

“Airbnb is currently the only short-term rental platform to ban parties globally and maintain a 24/7 neighbourhood support line.

“We look forward to working with the City of Winnipeg to ensure that it is able to fully benefit from the type of travel enabled by Airbnb.”

Airbnb’s policy only prohibits gatherings of 16 or more people.

Penner said reporting problem renters isn’t easy.

“Airbnb requires you to give them the specific listings on their site. It’s very hard to pinpoint the exact advertisement that is the party that we’re having an issue with” said Penner.

Leylek believes the people who are renting Airbnb suites are more likely to break public health orders.

“These are the populations we need to be most concerned about and they’re coming within metres from my front door” said Leylek."

Hell Yes!,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

Can you charge an electric car with a regular outlet? This is actually a very common question. Many people even skip past asking this question and assume the answer is “no.”

After all a car is a giant machine. Both phones and computers use normal electricity plugs and outlets (or potentially a USB outlet in the case of phones) but a car is much larger and must have to use a much larger cord and a special charging station right? A car can’t use the same plug as a computer can it?

Almost as soon as one is exposed to the world of electric vehicles they see that there are all kinds of EV charging stations on the market. They see pictures of EV charging stations — 350 kW ones 125 kW ones 50 kW ones 25 kW ones and 6 kW ones (the home chargers many companies sell for example). For sure you have to use one of those to charge an electric car right?

I remember when I finally learned even after covering this market for quite a while that electric vehicles could charge from normal outlets. I was shocked! I had thought that you needed to use those special charging stations that were always in pictures or being marketed on their own. I was sure way back then that most people didn’t realize you could charge from a normal electricity outlet and I’m sure that’s still the case today.

That said Volvo Cars might have helped quite a bit to dispel this myth. It has run a few electric vehicle ads either far more than any other electric vehicle ads or its ads have just been highly tailored to me and/or the platform I mostly use for watching or listening to stuff (YouTube). I think I’ve seen these Volvo ads more than all other electric vehicle ads combined and the ads have basically just been Volvo electric vehicles plugging into the wall with a cord that looks like the cord of an Apple MacBook Pro. I assume there were two main aims Volvo Cars had with these: 1) show how easy EV charging is and 2) show that you can charge with a normal plug in a normal outlet. (Admittedly these were ads for Volvo plug-in hybrids but I think a useful point was made nonetheless — I think a normal consumer would assume any electric car can charge like that which is indeed the case.)

Yes many EV owners decide that they need faster home charging and purchase a “Level 2” home charger. However many others decide that charging with a normal electricity outlet is fine and that’s all they do. I’m in the latter group since we recently moved to a home with a garage and that has been frequently reminding me of this question and helped to stimulate this article.

Even using basic 110V charging I don’t charge every day and I’ve stopped charging above 71%. (Why 71% instead of 70%? I don’t know. That’s just where I set the max charging.) I often charge every other day and I may even go two days without charging. Then I just plug in when arriving home and let the trickle charge do its thing. It may spend hours and hours charging on this regular electricity outlet but that doesn’t really matter to me if I’m in the house eating (too much) watching tennis working or sleeping. Even simply charging from late evening till morning would easily get the job done.

As it is even with our Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR+) whose range has dropped down to ~205 miles (last I checked several months ago) I charge between about 30% to 50% on the low end to 71% on the high end. Americans drive about twice as much as Europeans on average but that still amounts to just about 40 miles a day on average (less than that on a regular basis if you consider that the national average includes road trips which pull the average upward). I drive approximately that amount but without the road trips. Adding 40 miles a day or 80 miles every other day via trickle charging is not hard at all. The car is sitting parked about 96% of the time (that’s the US average) and 110V trickle charging adds about 4 miles an hour. So even 10 hours of charging (e.g. 7:00 pm to 5:00 am or 9:00 pm to 7:00 am) will add 40 miles of range. If you’re not out for 14 hours a day then it’s even easier to get those 40 miles in.

There are certainly some patterns of driving that make it worth it to some EV owners to get a Level 2 charging station that can charge at a much higher rate. However I think that assuming there isn’t a gigantic chunk of the market that can easily live with 110V charging on a regular outlet is a bad assumption.

Anything I’m leaving out here? Anything else to add on the topic of regular 110V electric vehicle charging?

In urging federal regulation Ford CEO Jim Farley becomes the highest-profile auto executive to publicly recognize a need to more closely monitor the emerging technology which is becoming more prevalent on America’s roadways just as questions are being raised about the potential risks to motorists. In limited areas companies are beginning to deploy fully autonomous ride-hailing services.

Farley's statements in an interview with The Associated Press follow increased scrutiny by regulators of Tesla's partially automated “Autopilot” driver-assist system which has been involved in a series of high-profile crashes. Tesla also is using selected owners to test its “Full Self-Driving” software on public roads.

“Absolutely” Farley said when asked whether federal regulations are needed. “Today the regulations are state-by-state"" he said of fully autonomous vehicles. ""They're really oriented toward the development of the technology not large-scale deployment of the technology.”

He suggested that legislators and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration were moving too slowly.

“Time is of the essence” Farley said explaining that Argo AI an autonomous vehicle company in which Ford is a major investor is moving ahead quickly with technology that will let Ford start an autonomous ride-hailing service.

Argo which is testing autonomous vehicles with human backup drivers in six U.S. cities expects to be ready for Ford to offer ride-hailing without human drivers sometime next year. In the Phoenix area Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is already offering a limited fully autonomous ride service.

And later this year Ford will offer “Blue Cruise” its own partially automated highway driving system that like Tesla's Autopilot keeps cars centered in their lane and a safe distance behind traffic in front of them. With Blue Cruise drivers can take their hands off the steering wheel. But unlike Autopilot they will be monitored by a camera to make sure they are paying attention.

“We've done the testing to feel comfortable with this system and how it's implemented” Farley said.

The CEO took an implicit jab at Tesla saying that Ford does its own testing before rolling out the technology.

“We don't want our customers to have to do any testing” he said.

Drivers often have thwarted Tesla's efforts to monitor them by detecting hands on the steering wheel. Earlier this month a man was arrested in California after an officer spotted his Tesla on a freeway with the man riding in the back seat and no one behind the wheel. The man told the AP that his car was fully autonomous and designed so that he could ride in the back seat.

That's not true. Tesla has explicitly told California regulators that both “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” are assist systems and that drivers must be ready to intervene.

A message was left Friday seeking comment from Tesla which has disbanded its media relations department.

Farley's stance on regulation is unique in the auto industry which has generally has favored voluntary guidelines over regulations. No federal regulations specifically govern electronic driving systems although they do fall under safety standards that cover all vehicles.

The industry’s biggest trade association the Alliance for Automotive Innovation last month proposed voluntary guidelines for partially automated systems. The government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has relied on voluntary cooperation taking a hands-off approach so as not to discourage life-saving innovations.

But a few in the business have asked for regulation. In April Dan Ammann CEO of GM's autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise told Bloomberg Television that it was important for the United States and other countries to chart a “clear regulatory pathway.” Regulations Ammann said are necessary for the U.S. to keep its leadership position.

In 2015 Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson asserted that a patchwork of state rules and the absence of U.S. federal oversight could slow the development and introduction of autonomous vehicles.

Since President Joe Biden's inauguration though NHTSA has said it is taking a new look at the automated systems. The agency has since sent investigators to review at least four crashes involving Teslas in which Autopilot is at least suspected of being involved and it is seeking public comment on developing safety principles for autonomous vehicles. In the past few years NHTSA has sent teams to 29 Tesla incidents.

Farley says he's pleased by a renewed interest in regulations.

“We're very encouraged that the new leaders in the administration want to take on large-scale deployment"" of autonomous vehicles he said."

It’s takes a lot to stall Amazon’s rapid growth even temporarily but the company announced recently that it has halted construction of a new warehouse in Connecticut after workers found another noose—the seventh one to date—dangling over a beam. Local police are now investigating the incident as a possible hate crime according to a report by the Associated Press.

Few companies have been more enriched during the pandemic than Amazon. The online retailer’s profits soared 84 percent in 2020 hitting $384 billion according to reports. The company has even taken to snapping up unoccupied shopping malls across the country to turn them into mini fulfillment centers NBC News recently reported.

The only thing that can stop that kind of rapid growth it seems are old-fashioned symbols of white terrorist violence. The first noose was reportedly found on April 27 and five more were discovered in the weeks that followed. The Greater Hartford chapter of the NAACP has gotten involved calling for a more serious response from police who taken to patrolling the construction site in recent weeks.

Still some workers paint an unflattering picture of their overall experience on the site. Carlos Best an ironworker and foreman told reporters that he’s heard racist comments on the job and has fired one worker for using disparaging racist language. “I did witness Confederate flags on people’s hats on the back of their cars. I personally heard racial remarks” he said during a press conference Thursday according to NPR.

Police local elected officials and even the FBI have reportedly gotten involved one official even vowing to reporters that they “will leave no stone unturned.”

Let’s hope all of those stones can be turned in about 48 hours as construction is slated to resume on Monday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZWF0dGxldGltZXMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FtYXpvbi9hbWF6b24tZGF0YS1zaG93ZWQtYmlnLWp1bXAtaW4tZGl2ZXJzaXR5LWFtb25nLXNlbmlvci1sZWFkZXJzLWFmdGVyLWRlZmluaXRpb24tb2YtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXdhcy1sb29zZW5lZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon data showed big jump in diversity among senior leaders — after definition of 'executive' was loosened,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Southwest Airlines used the same safety card for Boeing 737-800 and 737 MAX aircraft and so the card had both aircraft names on it. That was confusing to passengers so Southwest came up with new safety cards.

American Airlines has gone in the reverse direction. Their safety cards now say Boeing 737 whether it is a MAX or not.

The crew admin screen on the aircraft still shows ‘737 MAX’ so it’s just the customer facing seat back paper that appears to have been changed.

Boeing has made a run at rebranding the plane in light of its history. Since then new delivery MAX aircraft were even grounded for electrical issues.

However American Airlines offers

Our fleet harmonization plan began a few years ago and part of that plan included the standardization of safety cards including for Boeing 737 and Airbus 321 aircraft. The approach for the MAX safety card is consistent with other fleet types where we do not have different safety cards for sub-fleets.

It’s odd to me to call the 737 MAX a ‘subfleet’ rather than a different aircraft type. It isn’t just a group of planes that meet requirements for flying overwater such as carrying rafts (and American isn’t even putting rafts in all of its narrowbodies in order to eliminate subfleets). And suggesting it is a mere subfleet rather than a distinct plane is consistent with… minimizing the fact that passengers are flying on the 737 MAX.

I generally believe that the plane is quite safe and passengers will get over any concerns about flying on it however I’m not sure removing markers for passengers that they’re flying the mask is the best way of getting there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1zcGFpbi1pbmNyZWFzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Plans Spain Service Increases This Summer,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1zcGFpbi1pbmNyZWFzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bi1zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yMi9oZWF0LWluY3JlYXNpbmctY2FwYWNpdHktYXQtYW1lcmljYW5haXJsaW5lcy1hcmVuYS10by0xNzAwMC1mb3ItbmJhLXBsYXlvZmZzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miami Heat expand playoff capacity at AmericanAirlines Arena,"The Miami Heat announced Saturday that attendance at AmericanAirlines Arena will be increased to 17000 for the playoffs more than twice the capacity originally established by the NBA for the team in the postseason.

The Heat last week had announced playoff capacity for the 19600-seat facility alongside Biscayne Bay would be capped at 8600 due to ongoing pandemic concerns after the team completed the regular season with an attendance limit of 5700.

The move by the Heat aligns with similar moves by other NBA teams for the playoffs amid reduced recommended protocols by the Centers for Disease Control.

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said before Saturday’s playoff opener against the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum that it was an encouraging development.

“I think that’d be exciting for the fans for our players the organization” he said. “You just start to see more and more signs that things are coming around. It brings you a great deal of hope just in general. I think it’s a great thing.”

The Heat began the admission process during the earlier stages of the coronavirus pandemic with tight restrictions for attendance including the use of COVID-detection dogs a practice that since has been eliminated.

The new capacity will be in place beginning Thursday when the Heat host the Bucks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven first-round series and will remain in place for all remaining playoff games.

As a result of the increase additional tickets will go on sale to the general public Monday at 4:00 p.m. via Ticketmaster.com.

Although the increase in capacity means the Heat are no longer required to employ physical distancing between seats other health and safety protocols remain in place including the requirement to wear masks throughout the Arena when not eating and/or drinking while seated in the bowl or in designated food and beverage areas.

The team’s ongoing health-and-safety protocols for those attending can be found at HEAT.com/FanSafety.

The team noted that “Fans who purchased tickets but who no longer want to attend the game due to the removal of the physical distancing requirement may request a refund for their tickets via their place of purchase.”

Tickets from the NBA’s additional allowance will be made available first to season-ticket holders with those fans receiving communication directly from the team outlining their options.

“This last-minute approval to increase our capacity comes after we have already sold tickets for the first three home games of round one of the playoffs” Heat president Eric Woolworth said in a statement. “We realize this may be an inconvenience to some fans who have already purchased tickets and we apologize for that but we believe strongly that we owe it to our players to provide the best homecourt advantage for them to compete in the playoffs.”

Additionally as part of the team’s partnership with Florida Blue the Heat will be offering Moderna COVID-19 vaccinations to those in attendance. The Heat previously held a vaccination event on the arena floor at the close of the regular season.

The Bucks set their home capacity at 50 percent capacity about 9000 for Saturday’s game.

“Obviously it’s a great sign for our country and just everybody at large and in general that we’re making progress were moving in the right direction” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said of increased capacity around the league. “Still there’s a lot of work to be done with the virus and with COVID.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY21pYW1pLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pYW1pLWhlYXQtdG8taW5jcmVhc2Utc2VhdGluZy1jYXBhY2l0eS1mb3ItcGxheW9mZi1nYW1lcy8yNDU3MDU0L9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY21pYW1pLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pYW1pLWhlYXQtdG8taW5jcmVhc2Utc2VhdGluZy1jYXBhY2l0eS1mb3ItcGxheW9mZi1nYW1lcy8yNDU3MDU0Lz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miami Heat to Increase Seating Capacity for Playoff Games,"The Miami Heat announced Saturday they will be increasing the seating capacity at AmericanAirlines Arena for playoff games.

Yet the resemblance is deceiving. With its new battery-powered truck Ford is making a costly bet that buyers will embrace a vehicle that would help transform how the world drives.

Branded the F-150 Lightning the pickup will be able to travel up to 300 miles per battery charge thanks to a frame designed to safely hold a huge lithium-ion battery that can power your house should the electricity go out. Going from zero to 60 mph (97 kilometers per hour) will take just 4.5 seconds.

With a starting price near $40000 (before options) Ford has calculated that an electric version of America’s top-selling vehicle will appeal to the sorts of buyers who favor rugged pickup trucks prized for strength and durability. If it succeeds it could speed the nation’s transition away from petroleum burners — a cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s broad effort to fight climate change.

“It’s a watershed moment to me” Ford CEO Jim Farley said of the electric truck which was formally unveiled Wednesday night. “It’s a very important transition for our industry.”

For the Biden administration to prevail in its push for green energy-driven manufacturing it will need to overcome resistance as well as skepticism. Critics fear the loss of auto industry jobs in a shift away from gasoline-fueled vehicles. Because EVs are much simpler it takes fewer workers to build them. And bottlenecked supply chains could leave automakers short of computer chips and vehicle batteries along with other parts for months and perhaps years.

That said a vehicle like the Lightning is so critical to Biden’s policies that even before its formal unveiling he visited the Ford plant in Michigan where it will be built beginning next year. The president even drove the truck on a test track.

“This sucker’s quick” he declared.

For its part Ford is taking a significant risk by sinking so much capital into an electric version of a pickup that commands a huge and loyal following. In a typical year Ford sells about 900000 F-series trucks nationally. It has been America’s top-selling vehicle for nearly four decades.

Gas-powered F-150s are staples on job sites across the nation where workers haul equipment and materials and often don’t see a need for change. So it could be years before Ford realizes a return on its investment in an electric F-150. This year through April the company has sold only 10000 of its new gas-electric hybrid F-150s — just over 6% of the F-150’s total sales.

Still introducing a capable electric truck at a fairly reasonable price could potentially produce the breakthrough that draws many more people to battery-powered vehicles of all sizes said Ivan Drury a senior manager at Edmunds.com.

“If you’re going to choose one vehicle in the industry that’s going to do it this is going to be the one” Drury said. “I expect this to be a home run and I expect it to really convert a lot of consumers’ minds.”

At the same time the electric truck due in showrooms by the middle of next year comes at a time when American drivers remain reluctant to jettison gas vehicles. Through April automakers sold about 108000 fully electric vehicles in the U.S. Though that’s nearly twice the number from the same period last year EVs still account for only 2% of U.S. vehicle sales according to Edmunds.

In addition to the Lightning though the growing number of fully electric offerings will help raise sales numbers. Automakers now sell 18 electric models in the U.S.; Drury expects 30 by year’s end.

To be sure Ford won’t stop building gas-powered trucks for years. They remain an enormous cash cow. A study by the Boston Consulting Group found that the F-Series generates $42 billion in annual U.S. revenue for the automaker — more than such entire companies as McDonald’s Nike or Netflix do.

Initially Ford expects Lightning customers to be mainly higher-income urban and suburban residents who seldom go off road or use truck beds to haul anything heavy. But the company plans a commercial version designed to make work more efficient. Ultimately Farley expects sales to be evenly balanced between work and personal buyers.

But Ford may have a hard time selling it to people who build houses maintain lawns or plow snow.

“It sounds good but it’s not good for the type of business I’m in” said Jimmie Williams owner of a landscaping firm on Chicago’s South Side. He doesn’t think the battery will have enough range to last the 12-14-hour days his crews sometimes work maintaining about 700 properties.

He’ll stick with his three gas-powered pickups in part because he plows snow in the winter when cold weather can limit an EV’s range.

Others aren’t ready now but might be convinced to switch in the future.

“Maybe when I’m retired” quipped Steven Realy a foreman for a subcontractor at a housing development in Pittsfield Township Michigan.

Realy 28 whose company uses diesel trucks to carry equipment and building materials doesn’t think an electric truck will do the job now but maybe in the future.

“When electric takes off more than what it is right now” he said “I could see myself owning one definitely.”

Yet it may be difficult to persuade some people to give up the big gas engines they’re used to.

“I like my V-8” Anthony Lane a 26-year-old plumber in the same development said from the driver’s seat of his gleaming Chevrolet Silverado.

Aside from a charging port and a Lightning decal Ford’s new truck resembles a standard F-150. That was intentional. Ford wants the Lightning to be perceived as just as capable as gasoline versions if not more so.

Even the base version of the electric F-150 with two rows of seats and a 230-mile estimated range per battery charge can haul up to a ton in its bed. A high-end Lightning equipped with a longer-range battery can tow an estimated 10000 pounds matching many gas-powered trucks though falling about 3000 pounds shy of Ford’s V-8 engines.

Perhaps the most surprising thing about the truck is its price which Ford said is about equal to a comparably equipped gasoline F-150. With a federal tax credit of up to $7500 still available on Ford electric vehicles the base price falls to around $32500. That’s below the lowest-priced gas F-150 with a crew cab which starts at roughly $37000.

The Lightning has a front trunk with plugs for power tools and lights at job or camp sites. And if the electricity goes out it can run your house for up to three days which Farley expects to be a big selling point.

Competition for the Lightning is looming. General Motors says it’s working on an electric Silverado. Stellantis is developing an electric Ram. Tesla’s angular Cybertruck is due out this year. And startups Bollinger Motors Nikola Rivian and Lordstown Motors have trucks in the works.

All will face an inevitable obstacle in seeking buyers: brand loyalty. Pickup drivers often stick with one company for life. Sometimes they choose a brand because it’s been in the family for years if not generations.

“I’m not a Ford guy” said Lane the plumber. “I drive Chevys my whole life.”

Once General Motors comes out with an electric Silverado though Lane might consider a change.

“I’ll probably stick with the gas” he said. “But if they ever fully switch over to electric I’ll probably get the Chevy one.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL21heS8yMy9hbWVyaWNhLWZvcmQtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZXMtbGlnaHRuaW5n0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvbWF5LzIzL2FtZXJpY2EtZm9yZC1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy1saWdodG5pbmc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turn off the gas: is America ready to embrace electric vehicles?,"In Detroit auto plants have for decades churned out trucks built with Motor City steel and fueled by gasoline. But this week’s rollout of the Ford F-150 Lightning electric truck offered a vision of the future in America’s automotive heartland: aluminum-clad pickups running off of electric powertrains with lithium batteries.

An electric model of the nation’s best-selling vehicle at an accessible $40000 has the potential to shift the auto industry’s course and do more to advance the transportation sector’s electrification than any recent development analysts say.

“Offering a well-known vehicle at a competitive price could really help push the EV agenda in the US” said Jessica Caldwell executive director of insights at Edmunds.com.

Meanwhile Ford characterized the Lightning’s introduction as a “watershed moment” but it also represents a major gamble. The F-150 embodies American ruggedness and it raises the question: is the truck market’s meat-and-potatoes base ready to embrace environmentally friendly electric vehicles (EVs)?

It’s uncharted territory said Michelle Krebs Autotrader executive analyst. The success of the Lightning or any EV hinges on a major infrastructure build-out that’s far from certain.

“There’s no EV pickup market at the moment so we just don’t know how big it could be or what consumer acceptance will be” she said.

Truck consumers are generally unwilling to switch to cars just to go electric Krebs said. So pitching them on the Lightning not only opens a new market for Ford but is a critical step in the nation’s efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions of which the transportation sector accounts for 29%. The EV transition is a key component of Joe Biden’s climate plan which calls for the nation to cut emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050.

Though EVs only make up less than 2% of new-vehicle sales in the US there’s perhaps no better line to push the needle on those figures than the F-Series. Last year Ford generated about $42bn in the sale of over 800000 F-Series trucks according to data from the company and Edmunds.com. Sales of the F-150 the line’s light-duty truck exceeded 556000.

The Lightning feature that seems to be catching the most attention isn’t under the hood or in the cab but on the price tag. With EV tax incentives the truck’s base model could cost about $32000 – less than a $37000 gas-powered F-150 with a crew cab. By contrast the GMC Hummer EV and Rivian R1T are priced at $80000 and $70000 though they are slightly flashier.

The Lightning also marks one of the first attempts to electrify a well-known everyday vehicle that appeals to a mass market. Previously EVs were mostly small unconventionally designed cars that appealed to environmentally minded people who made a personality statement with their vehicle Caldwell said. The “pendulum has swung” in terms of design she added.

The Lightning’s range is also notable. One charge will take a base model Lightning 230 miles or for an additional $20000 the extended range trim will travel 300 miles. It can haul up to 2000lb of payload and tow up to 10000lb. However Ford doesn’t offer any data on range with a heavy payload or tow and Car And Drive estimated it at as little as 100 miles.

That’s the type of detail that could keep consumers away from not just the Lightning but all electric pickups. On a 150kw DC fast charger the extended-range trim targets up to 54 miles of range in 10 minutes or just under an hour for a full charge.

It’s not hard to imagine a scenario in which someone who may be buying a truck to tow a camper a long distance once or twice per year opting for a gas-powered F-150 instead being inconvenienced with an hour-long stop to recharge every 100 miles or so Caldwell said.

But several once-in-a-while Lightning features are generating a buzz like a drain hole in case the cab needs to be hosed out. Its dual battery system can power tools in the field or a house for three days during an outage. The F-150 Hybrid was utilized as a mobile generator in the recent deadly Texas blackouts.

The Lightning’s power is another selling point – it can go 0-60mph in just over four seconds offers 775lb-ft of torque and the extended range model targets 563 horsepower.

That was enough to impress the president who test drove a Lightning during a Michigan stop last week. “This sucker’s quick” he declared.

Among those who will need to harness the truck’s full power and hauling capacity are contractors. It’s worth consideration said Dave Alder an electrician in Detroit especially if it could save on gas money. But he worried about where he would charge it and said it’s a bit of a “If it’s not broken don’t fix it” situation with his gas-powered Chevy Silverado.

The Lightning has the support of the United Auto Workers union which at times has been skeptical of electrification. The truck will be built at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn which sits just outside of Detroit and next to the Dearborn Truck Plant that produces gas-powered and hybrid F-150s. Lightning production is slated to start next spring with the trucks hitting the lot in mid-2022.

Critical to its success is an infrastructure build out and Biden’s $2tn infrastructure plan includes $174bn to support the EV transition.

Biden has framed his pitch by repeatedly claiming the US is in an electrification race with China.

“The future of the auto industry is electric. There’s no turning back” he said during the Lightning’s unveiling. “The question is whether we will lead or we will fall behind in the race to the future.”

Buy-in from the auto industry could help Biden push his proposal with Congress though it’s uniformly opposed by the GOP. Republican leadership has pointed to the lack of infrastructure as a chief reason for opposing spending on the EV transition but at the same time opposes funding an infrastructure build-out.

American consumers have said they won’t buy an EV without the infrastructure in place Krebs said which leaves the industry facing a “chicken and egg” situation.

“That’s key – they have got to have the charging infrastructure in place or this will all go kaput” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9jYW4teW91LWNoYXJnZS1hbi1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItd2l0aC1hLXJlZ3VsYXItb3V0bGV0LWhlbGwteWVzL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9jYW4teW91LWNoYXJnZS1hbi1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItd2l0aC1hLXJlZ3VsYXItb3V0bGV0LWhlbGwteWVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can You Charge an Electric Car with a Regular Outlet? Hell Yes!,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

Can you charge an electric car with a regular outlet? This is actually a very common question. Many people even skip past asking this question and assume the answer is “no.”

After all a car is a giant machine. Both phones and computers use normal electricity plugs and outlets (or potentially a USB outlet in the case of phones) but a car is much larger and must have to use a much larger cord and a special charging station right? A car can’t use the same plug as a computer can it?

Almost as soon as one is exposed to the world of electric vehicles they see that there are all kinds of EV charging stations on the market. They see pictures of EV charging stations — 350 kW ones 125 kW ones 50 kW ones 25 kW ones and 6 kW ones (the home chargers many companies sell for example). For sure you have to use one of those to charge an electric car right?

I remember when I finally learned even after covering this market for quite a while that electric vehicles could charge from normal outlets. I was shocked! I had thought that you needed to use those special charging stations that were always in pictures or being marketed on their own. I was sure way back then that most people didn’t realize you could charge from a normal electricity outlet and I’m sure that’s still the case today.

That said Volvo Cars might have helped quite a bit to dispel this myth. It has run a few electric vehicle ads either far more than any other electric vehicle ads or its ads have just been highly tailored to me and/or the platform I mostly use for watching or listening to stuff (YouTube). I think I’ve seen these Volvo ads more than all other electric vehicle ads combined and the ads have basically just been Volvo electric vehicles plugging into the wall with a cord that looks like the cord of an Apple MacBook Pro. I assume there were two main aims Volvo Cars had with these: 1) show how easy EV charging is and 2) show that you can charge with a normal plug in a normal outlet. (Admittedly these were ads for Volvo plug-in hybrids but I think a useful point was made nonetheless — I think a normal consumer would assume any electric car can charge like that which is indeed the case.)

Yes many EV owners decide that they need faster home charging and purchase a “Level 2” home charger. However many others decide that charging with a normal electricity outlet is fine and that’s all they do. I’m in the latter group since we recently moved to a home with a garage and that has been frequently reminding me of this question and helped to stimulate this article.

Even using basic 110V charging I don’t charge every day and I’ve stopped charging above 71%. (Why 71% instead of 70%? I don’t know. That’s just where I set the max charging.) I often charge every other day and I may even go two days without charging. Then I just plug in when arriving home and let the trickle charge do its thing. It may spend hours and hours charging on this regular electricity outlet but that doesn’t really matter to me if I’m in the house eating (too much) watching tennis working or sleeping. Even simply charging from late evening till morning would easily get the job done.

As it is even with our Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR+) whose range has dropped down to ~205 miles (last I checked several months ago) I charge between about 30% to 50% on the low end to 71% on the high end. Americans drive about twice as much as Europeans on average but that still amounts to just about 40 miles a day on average (less than that on a regular basis if you consider that the national average includes road trips which pull the average upward). I drive approximately that amount but without the road trips. Adding 40 miles a day or 80 miles every other day via trickle charging is not hard at all. The car is sitting parked about 96% of the time (that’s the US average) and 110V trickle charging adds about 4 miles an hour. So even 10 hours of charging (e.g. 7:00 pm to 5:00 am or 9:00 pm to 7:00 am) will add 40 miles of range. If you’re not out for 14 hours a day then it’s even easier to get those 40 miles in.

There are certainly some patterns of driving that make it worth it to some EV owners to get a Level 2 charging station that can charge at a much higher rate. However I think that assuming there isn’t a gigantic chunk of the market that can easily live with 110V charging on a regular outlet is a bad assumption.

Anything I’m leaving out here? Anything else to add on the topic of regular 110V electric vehicle charging?

The eruption called a coronal mass ejection wasn’t particularly powerful on the space-weather scale but when it hit the Earth’s magnetic field it triggered the strongest geomagnetic storm seen for years. There wasn’t much disruption this time -- few people probably even knew it happened -- but it served as a reminder the sun has woken from a years-long slumber.

While invisible and harmless to anyone on the Earth’s surface the geomagnetic waves unleashed by solar storms can cripple power grids jam radio communications bathe airline crews in dangerous levels of radiation and knock critical satellites off kilter. The sun began a new 11-year cycle last year and as it reaches its peak in 2025 the specter of powerful space weather creating havoc for humans grows threatening chaos in a world that has become ever more reliant on technology since the last big storms hit 17 years ago.

The store exclusive to Amex cardholders offers concessions and merchandise to help fans avoid long lines and get back to the action faster. The store is a partnership between Amex and the sports arena to keep fans safe from COVID-19.

According to the American Express Trendex: Experiences Survey nearly two-thirds of live-entertainment consumers agree that because of COVID-19 contactless payment options have never been more important to them. And 70% say that having a contactless payment option available would make them feel more comfortable returning to live sports music and entertainment events.

Card members can tap their contactless Amex card mobile wallet or insert their card to enter the shop. There may be a $1.00 hold on the card which will be updated after purchases are completed. Technology tracks movements in the store with each item having a unique weight that is tracked through weight-sensitive shelf sensors.

If an item is replaced on an incorrect shelf the system will identify that the item was moved -- but not purchased -- and the inventory report will alert the store operator that an item is in the wrong location. In-store staff are available to monitor any issues that may arise.

After making a purchase cardholders can see their receipts at Go.Amex/Bkshop. You'll need to enter the last four digits of your physical card or digital wallet four-digit tail number along with the date and approximate time of purchase. All sales are final due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An American Express spokeswoman notes that it is focused on launching the American Express Shop at Barclays Center so there are no plans at this time to expand in additional locations.

""During the investigation the ICO found that Amex had sent over 50 million of what it classed as servicing emails to its customers"" the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said.

""The ICO revealed that for nearly 12 months between 1 June 2018 and 21 May 2019 4098841 of those emails were marketing emails designed to encourage customers to make purchases on their cards which would benefit Amex financially.""

Amex's argument that they were servicing emails designed to inform their customers of ongoing campaigns was deemed groundless by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

As the data regulator discovered complaints showed the messages were instead direct marketing emails sent to customers who opted out.

The company also rejected the complaints and decided not to review its marketing model considering that the marketing emails were a requirement of Credit Agreements with customers.

""Our investigation was initiated from just a handful of complaints from customers tired of being interrupted with emails they did not want to receive"" added Andy Curry ICO Head of Investigations.

""I would encourage all companies to revisit their procedures and familiarise themselves with the differences between a service email and a marketing email and ensure their email communications with customers are compliant with the law.""

Direct marketing emails classified by Amex as servicing emails

By sending marketing emails to those who didn't freely consent to receive them Amex broke Regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) that give people specific privacy rights in relation to electronic communications.

While the UK data watchdog can impose monetary penalties of up to £500000 on data controllers it decided to fine Amex only £90000 because the company did not ""deliberately set out to contravene PECR in this instance.""

Amex can pay this fine by June 17 and if the payment is made in advance the Commissioner will also reduce it by 20% to £72000.

""This is a clear example of a company getting it wrong and now facing the reputational consequences of that error"" the ICO Head of Investigations added.

""The emails in question all clearly contained marketing material as they sought to persuade and encourage customers to use their card to make purchases.""

Billions of cicadas are emerging in eastern US,"CNN —

Love is in the air this spring in the eastern United States where billions of cicadas are appearing in the biggest emergence event since 2004.

The insects are part of a group called Brood X — also known as the Great Eastern Brood — which is expected in a geographical range stretching from Tennessee to New York.

These cicadas have been subterranean for 17 years tunneling and feeding beneath the soil. When they are back above ground finding a mate will be understandably a top priority. The loud buzzing drone cicadas make is actually a mating song emitted by male insects flexing a drumlike organ called a tymbal.

“It’s all boys calling girls” said entomologist Eric Day of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University extension. “First you get a few here and there then what happens is they start chorusing — there’s so many of them that the cicada calls all combine in this huge chorus.”

While cicadas can be a nuisance for some orchardists and farmers witnessing them is also an awe-inspiring experience Day said.

“This is a real treat. This is an unusual biological phenomenon. Periodical cicadas only occur in the eastern United States; they don’t occur anywhere else in the world” he said. “It’s just going to be an amazingly big big show.”

When and where will the cicadas emerge this year?

That show doesn’t kick off until the ground warms up. Cicadas which are not harmful to humans or animals begin to emerge when the soil reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit Day said.

A few individuals come out in mid-to-late April Day said stragglers that the entomologist nicknames “lonesome Bobs” who call and call to no avail. The true large-scale emergence happens in May.

Scientists differ about the precise range of Brood X cicadas but entomologist Gene Kritsky dean of behavioral and natural sciences at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati — and the unofficial dean of Brood X cicadas — expects to see them in 14 states plus the District of Columbia.

Brood X — the “X” is the Roman numeral for 10 — is the largest group of 17-year cicadas said Kritsky author of the new book “Periodical Cicadas: The Brood X Edition.” (Other periodical cicada groups emerge on a 13-year cycle.)

Scientists don’t know the precise reasons behind the cicada schedules or why both kinds of periodical cicadas have prime-numbered life spans. Emerging en masse though helps the bugs survive predation and mate successfully as birds and small mammals only can pick off so many cicadas at once.

The great numbers of cicadas during this event can be a nuisance to farmers but the insects aren't harmful to humans or animals. Gene Kritsky/Mount St. Joseph University

When it comes to such reproduction strategies this year’s cicadas have a lot in common with other broods. What sets Brood X apart from other cicada emergences however is proximity to large metropolitan areas.

“About 35 million Americans will have the opportunity to interact with Brood X” Kritsky said noting that they will likely be spotted in Philadelphia; Washington DC; Baltimore; Cincinnati; and Indianapolis. In the past Brood X cicadas have even emerged in New York City’s Central Park.

Early signs of cicadas include finger-size holes in the ground near the base of trees. You might also spot a chimneylike tunnel poking out of the soil.

When the insects do appear they make an impressive amount of noise. Once Kritsky said he recorded a cicada chorus while sitting in a cemetery below the flight path for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron Kentucky.

The insects clocked in at 96 decibels drowning out the sound of passenger jets passing directly overhead. The chorus won’t last long however. Cicadas usually die just four to six weeks after emergence.

Will cicadas harm your garden?

When cicadas emerge gardeners may see the insects crawling over plants but it’s nothing to worry about said Paula Shrewsbury an associate professor in the University of Maryland’s department of entomology.

“There’s very little evidence that cicadas do any damage at all” said Shrewsbury who is a member of UMD’s self-declared Cicada Crew and is teaching a graduate class about periodic cicadas this semester. Bugs quickly will move on to the trees where they mate and lay eggs.

Cicadas prefer to lay eggs on the outer parts of pencil-size branches where they make a small slit and create egg nests. “Egg laying can damage the tips of the trees and the tips of the trees will die back — it’s called flagging” Shrewsbury said.

Older established trees can easily recover from flagging. A small tree with a trunk diameter about 2 inches or less though could be vulnerable. That means it’s worth delaying new plantings and protecting existing small trees.

“Insecticides are not the best option” Shrewsbury said adding that covering trees works better than chemicals. Insecticides could also harm the beneficial pollinators on which flowering trees and plants depend.

To cover small trees enclose them in netting with holes smaller than a centimeter. Tie netting at the bottom to prevent the cicadas from crawling up Shrewsbury said being sure to secure the seam tightly too.

Overall she said cicadas benefit gardens. When the insects emerge from the soil they create holes that increase aeration and water penetration. Over the cicada life cycle exoskeletons and dying adults will fall to the ground breaking down into organic matter and nutrients that feed the soil.

Leave the cicada exoskeletons and bodies where they are Shrewsbury said or rake them up and toss onto your compost pile.

Citizen scientists improve the cicada map

What should you do if you see a Brood X cicada? Enjoy it for one. If hordes of insects emerging from the earth sounds to you like a sign of the end times consider that this is instead a remarkable chance to see a glorious and somewhat mysterious natural event.

People have been marveling at the emergence of these insects for a long long time.

The first written record of emerging Brood X cicadas is from 1715 said Kritsky the entomologist when Swedish clergyman Rev. Andreas Sandel saw the insects in Philadelphia. People there mistaking cicadas for (unrelated) locusts that appear in the Bible and Torah split the bugs open and ate them.

Eating cicadas is certainly an option. They’re a low-fat source of protein. Dogs and cats may try to eat them too. Cicadas aren’t toxic so don’t worry if your pet snaps one up but experts at the Animal Medical Center of New York City recommend that you not let them gorge.

If you or your pet do make a meal of a cicada Kritsky wants you to snap a photo first. He’s a cocreator of the app Cicada Safari designed to use location- and date-stamped image submissions to improve existing maps of the Brood X range.

“We’re hoping that people will go out and tell us where cicadas emerge” Kritsky said. “Once we approve that photograph it goes live on our map so people can actually follow the emergence as it happens day by day.”

Given the size of Brood X distribution Kritsky noted that it’s impossible for a single lab to comprehensively track the phenomenon without help from volunteers. “If you have a lot of boots on the ground and a verification system you can really get a solid map” he said.

Cicadas at risk from habitat loss and climate change

Fine-tuning maps of cicada emergence is important in part because scientists including Kritsky are working to understand how habitat loss and climate change are affecting the insects.

Concern about the welfare of cicadas is nothing new. “Back in the 1890s the USDA thought cicadas were going extinct” Kritsky said. Even at that time scientists noticed how clear-cutting and deforestation were diminishing the cicada population.

That’s an ongoing trend Kritsky said. “Distribution is being impacted by deforestation for agriculture and now deforestation for urbanization.” Clear-cutting for roads and power lines is also a problem as is the massive die-off of trees in the Midwest due to emerald ash borer infestations.

Climate change affects the emergence in two main ways Kritsky said. The first is a trend toward earlier emergence driven by warmer spring weather. In southwest Ohio one area where Kritsky has studied historic data mass cicada emergence occurs an average of two weeks earlier than they did prior to 1950.

The other impact of climate change is more complex. There has been an increase of cicada “spin-offs” when a group of insects emerges years earlier than expected.

Why? Cicadas count down to their emergence by tracking the cycle of seasons. A mild winter that fluctuates between freezes and thaws sometimes throws the insects off Kritsky thinks. “It can cause the cicadas to count two years when only one has passed” he said.

In the year 2000 four years before Brood X was scheduled to appear cicadas came out early. Many died but some in southwestern Ohio survived to form a separate group that reemerged in 2017. “We had the first time we could document an off-cycle emergence. Seventeen years later they came out in even bigger numbers” Kritsky said.

Given the natural time cycle of 17-year cicadas this will only be Kritsky’s third chance to witness a Brood X emergence despite a lifetime of studying the insects. Data contributed by citizen scientists in 2021 though could help future researchers understand the massive cicada group.

“My hope is that we’ll get a good baseline this year to serve as a way of really verifying the way the cicada emergences of the future take place” Kritsky said. “I’m 67 but I’ll be very interested to see how Brood X compares when it comes out again in 2038.”

On April 30 the members of Pine Valley Golf Club in New Jersey which has a course routinely rated as the very best in the United States voted to finally allow women to join their club — a mere 108 years after its founding. Previously women had only been allowed at the club as guests of members and if they wanted to actually play golf they could only do so on a Sunday afternoon.

In an email to members who include Jack Nicklaus (and Arnold Palmer and Sean Connery before their deaths) Pine Valley club president Jim Davis said “the future of golf must move toward inclusion” adding that the change puts the club “on the right side of history.” Pine Valley will now begin the process of identifying women candidates for membership and is expected to have its first female members by the end of 2021.

It’s hard to believe that in the 21st century there was even a single private golf club that still excluded women from membership. Augusta National an 88-year-old institution not exactly known for its forward thinking — it only admitted its first black member in 1990 — began admitting women nearly a decade ago.

But it’s perfectly legal to discriminate. Because these clubs are private rather than public organizations federal laws can’t regulate them or their membership policies. The US Supreme Court has also upheld the right of private membership clubs under the First Amendment terming it as “expressive association” and any changes that have come about for example allowing in members of color are usually due to public pressure.

Today there are thought to be less than a dozen male-only golf clubs remaining in the United States with a combined membership estimated at fewer than 5000. And remarkably there are four in the Chicago area.

Butler National in Chicago Ill. is one. Formed as a men’s club in 1972 it hosted the PGA Tour’s Western Open from 1974-1990. But its men-only membership policy has precluded it from staging a PGA or USGA tournament ever since. In the summer of 1990 the PGA Tour announced new guidelines forbidding any club with discriminatory membership policies to host their tournaments. It left Butler with a choice: Let women in or lose the Western Open. It chose the latter.

The last time the club’s members held a vote on admitting women was in 2012 — the same year Augusta National admitted women to their club — and they decided against it. “It’s just what we want and we have the right to make that decision” said Butler President Ed Gustafson. “The membership has spoken clearly.”

While five-time major winner Phil Mickelson loves the course at Butler National he has spoken out about their admissions policy.

“In this day and age exclusion just isn’t the right way to go about it” he said in 2017. “I would love to see them be more inclusive in their policies but it’s not for me to interfere in any private club. But it is disappointing because that will prevent it from holding some big tournament at a truly spectacular venue.”

Thirty miles or so north is Old Elm Club in Highland Park home to another critically acclaimed course and an attitude best described as “traditional.” With an clientele of CEOs and retirees it’s joked that the age of the average member at Old Elm is deceased. Butler National and Old Elm are in sharp contrast to the other two men-only clubs in the region: Bob-O-Link Golf Club also in Highland Park and Black Sheep Golf Club in Sugar Grove. Opened in 1916 Bob-O-Link has a website that offers nothing to the curious visitor not even contact details. All that exists on the site is a log-in box for members.

And yet Bob-O-Link is known for being relaxed when it comes to other types of rules and regulations. There is no dress code for example. You can even play with your shirt off if you feel so inclined. And it’s said they also have a suggestion box for members — but it’s in the pond by the 2nd hole.

8 WOMEN NOT INCLUDED: There are thought to be about a dozen men-only golf clubs left in the US including Pine Valley which will start allowing female members at the end of 2021. Above are some of the known ones.

Black Sheep Golf Course meanwhile stands apart from other clubs in that it’s completely without frills. There’s no swimming pool dining room or tennis court — just a golf course (without any flowers or trees) a bar and a grill which members pay up to $85000 in initiation fees for the privilege of enjoying. Women meanwhile can’t even use the 300-yard road that leads up to the clubhouse. If they want to drop off their husbands they have to leave them on the main road and let them walk up.

Members call it the Walk of Shame.

LINKS magazine dubbed Chicago’s scene the “last bastion of golf Neanderthalia” but it’s not the only area where men-only golf clubs continue to flourish.

On Long Island NY lies Garden City Golf Club which still has the same all-male membership policy it did when it opened in 1899. In a 2018 statement the club’s president Brian Nelsen defended the club’s approach: “The Garden City Golf Club has a 119-year tradition as a private club which accepts male members. As a private club any rule change must be voted on by its membership. Although our entrance requirements may change in the future we don’t currently have plans to change our criteria for membership.”

In Dallas Texas meanwhile you’ll find Preston Trail a club that’s been described as equal parts golf club and frat house. Women aren’t allowed and nor are under-21s as local prodigy Jordan Spieth found out when he was younger. Despite having played in professional events while still in high school and being the youngest ever member of the US Presidents Cup team Spieth was denied the opportunity to take to the course until he finally played it on his 21st birthday. (The club is a lot more relaxed about its dress code. Mickey Mantle is said to have played an entire round there naked using his Cadillac as a golf cart.)

Preston Trail has a rumored initiation fee of anywhere between $125000 and $250000 and new members require approvals that often take five years to be granted. Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo who has dabbled in playing professional golf is said to be on the list — a fact that is impossible to confirm because nearly all male-only clubs forbid their members from talking.

They also restrict their members and guests from using cellphones (apart from in strictly designated areas) and from disseminating any images of their clubs on social media.

Garden City Golf Club’s rule reads: “Cell phones and similar electronic communication devices are not permitted anywhere on the golf course or Club grounds other than in cars in the parking lot.”

It’s surprising just how far some clubs will go to preserve their all-male status. Burning Tree Club in Bethesda Md. for instance would rather pay more tax than allow women to join. In 1989 the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that the club did not qualify for the same tax breaks as similarly sized clubs in the area because of its membership policy.

The net result is that Burning Tree is now reported to pay an additional $150000 in taxes each year (or about the cost of two new memberships).

Miklós Breitner golf consultant and founder of Golf Business Monitor said “on a very basic level ignoring women makes no financial sense. Forbes has found that women control or influence 85 percent of consumer spending and in the United States alone the purchasing power of women is anywhere between $5 trillion and $15 trillion. Golf clubs could really do with some of that especially post-pandemic.”

Legend has it that Burning Tree came into being when four male golfers got stuck behind a group of female players at the nearby Chevy Chase Golf Club and decided there and then to found a club where women weren’t allowed on the property yet alone tee it up.

8 Burning Tree denied former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O’Connor entry to the club. AP

Nearly a century later Burning Tree boasts many presidents as past members including FDR Eisenhower JFK Lyndon Johnson Richard Nixon and George HW Bush — but still no women. In fact the club even denied a membership to former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and it still refuses to allow female Secret Service agents on the property. There are no women’s locker rooms or female bathrooms at the club.

Indeed the only time when women are allowed into Burning Tree is in December when they can book an appointment to buy Christmas presents for their husbands in the club shop — but only in a three-hour slot on Saturdays.

Breitner isn’t surprised.

“Most golf clubs not just the men-only ones are designed solely for men’s needs instead or for the whole family and for that matter members of the LGBTQ community. Their business model is simply not aligned with modern society.”

He said that as long as there is demand for male-only clubs — and there still is — and legislation isn’t enacted to outlaw them there will always be some clubs holding on to “tradition.” For many of these members it seems there is an old-school appeal about being part of something so exclusive even if it’s an outdated concept and it’s what they’re used to and want to preserve.

“But we’re in the 21st century” Breitner added “and most golfers regard them as irrelevant at the very least or more likely as relics. Who would want to join one? Really?

About 500 people total have been allowed into this golf club

As news of his impending divorce from wife Melinda broke this month Bill Gates was tracked down to The Vintage an ultra-exclusive private golf club and retreat near Palm Springs Calif. The Post reported that Gates had been hiding out at the luxury resort where he first told his golf buddies that his marriage was over.

Opened in 1980 The Vintage is arguably the most exclusive club in the United States.

The 712-acre site boasts 500 private homes two golf courses an 85000-square-foot clubhouse a host of restaurants 11 tennis courts (complete with 1000-seater stadium) and an 18000-square-foot luxury spa complete with a hydromassage bed. The Vintage also employs a fully trained medical unit ready to attend to any emergency and a security team so vigilant it’s said every resident can leave their doors unlocked safe in the knowledge nothing will go missing.

The Microsoft founder purchased his 13573-square-foot property in 1999 for $12.5 million and it sits alongside one of The Vintage’s two pristine championship golf courses (both designed by acclaimed architect Tom Fazio). Gates’ house features six bedrooms nine bathrooms and presumably excellent Wi-Fi. You can see why Gates chose The Vintage and it wasn’t just for the stunning desert setting in a natural cove at the foot of Eisenhower Mountain in Indian Wells.

While it’s believed that women have always been allowed in as members of the golf club it’s impossible for almost any human to get in. An estimated 500 people are members — including billionaires Dennis Washington Charles Koch and Philip Anshultz.

Potential inductees must be invited and even then they must stump up the $250000 initiation fee plus $32000 in annual fees as well as own a home at the resort which can cost up to $20 million.

Cell systems depend on well-placed antennas transmitter/receivers digital signal processors and other communications equipment. Initially this meant a proliferation of ugly metal masts studded with uglier electronic thingummies. The nation’s NIMBYs rose to object until the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed the power of local governments to restrict the cell masts. Municipalities were able however to require that some effort be made to make them blend into the surroundings. From the first “Frankenpine” in Denver in 1992 thinly disguised cell towers have evolved to almost fit into ecosystems across the country.

Photographer Annette Lemay Burke became captivated by their “accepted yet contrived aesthetic.” From 2015 to 2020 she embarked on a series of road trips across the American West to seek them out the result of which has just been published in her monograph Fauxliage (Daylight Books).

“The towers have an array of creative concealments” she writes. “They often impersonate trees such as evergreens palms and saguaros. Some pillars serve other uses such as flagpoles or iconographic church crosses. Generally the towers are just simulacra. They are water towers that hold no water windmills that provide no power and trees that provide no oxygen. Yet they all provide five bars of service.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1LzIzL3NvbWUtcHJvdGVzdHMtYnV0LW1vc3Qtc3R1ZGVudHMtaGFwcHktbGVhdmUtdXQtbGl2ZS1jZXJlbW9ueS81MjA5ODQ0MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some protests but most students happy to leave UT with live ceremony,"Alexx Montanez a University of Texas cheerleader and Puerto Rican native who went to high school in Cedar Park says that a few months ago having an in-person graduation seemed so unlikely that she wasn’t going to buy her regalia.

That changed over spring break when UT announced that it would host the first large-scale in-person commencement ceremony since the coronavirus pandemic began.

On Saturday night Montanez and her twin sister Amanda were decked out in traditional graduation gowns and caps to join nearly 10000 other graduates at Royal-Memorial Stadium for an event that's usually held on the south lawn of the UT Tower.

Texas President Jay Hartzell led the 138th annual ceremonies which last year took place virtually because of the pandemic.

“Isn’t it great to be back together in this venue? Isn’t it good to see people without a screen and a mute button?” he told a cheering crowd of students many of whom hadn’t been around their classmates all year. (Masks were neither required nor worn by most attendees.)

Hartzell noted that of the 9855 spring graduates 13 were making history as the first graduates of the UT Dell Medical School.

Student body class president Anagha Kikkeri shared some of the lessons she learned from her family and applied to her time at UT.

“What was hard to bear is sweet to remember” Kikkeri said remembering that Hurricane Harvey hit just as she and her classmates were starting their first semester in 2017.

A few years later they pioneered a new form of virtual learning when the pandemic started and endured the state’s record freeze in February. It has been unprecedented in every way she said.

Although the recent upheaval over “The Eyes of Texas” wasn’t mentioned by name Kikkeri UT's first female Indian student body president described the racism that she endured during her youth when she wasn’t “Indian enough” and wasn’t “American enough” either.

“You can’t change the wind but you can change the sails” she said.

Kikkeri ended with a quote from the Bhagavad Gita: “What belongs to you today belonged to someone yesterday and will be someone else's tomorrow. Change is the law of the universe.”

Disney executive Bob Iger whose son was among the graduates didn't speak directly to the ""Eyes"" controversy either but urged the students to take risks for what's right.

“Our world is changing faster than we thought possible"" he said. ""If there was ever a time for you to be bold it is now.”

Iger used the movies “Coco” and “Black Panther” as examples of “bold decisions” that led to significant changes in our culture and society.

“The only way to accomplish meaningful things is to take swift action and stand in courage when confronted with tough and unpopular choices. Recognize the collective power of bold actions” he said.

At the end of the ceremony students from every section including several doctoral and graduate students who were seated on the field walked toward the exits to leave early when “The Eyes of Texas” started playing over the speakers.

Some of them like Victoria Garcia were doing it in protest of the song.

“It was really offensive to a lot of my fellow peers and I felt like I had an obligation to stand with them” Garcia said after the ceremony. “I’m in social work so people being discriminated against is something I’m always going to be fighting against.”

Jonathan Pavia an Austin native who graduated with a biochemistry degree said he stayed through the song even though he thinks it should be eliminated from school functions.

“Even if slavery is long gone it’s still something that hits home for a lot of people” Pavia said. “I think that giving UT the most inclusive and unifying name is what’s best. If it doesn’t affect you that doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect other people.”

John Gomez an electrical engineering graduate said he’d heard about the protest too. Although he is against the continued use of the song his family had traveled from Colombia to attend.

“I wanted to make the most out of (the ceremony) and staying to the end was important for them and for me"" Gomez said. ""I understand its racist roots and there’s undergoing change to fix that but it wasn’t enough to influence my decision to walk out.”

Iris Hernandez a government major from Amarillo was not aware of the walkout over the song. She was just happy to have finished 437 days of an unprecedented college experience.

Hernandez said getting to virtual classes became harder as the year went on and Saturday was the first time she met many of her classmates in person.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL3RoZS1hcC10b3dlci10aGUtYW5hdG9teS1vZi1hbi1pZGYtZGlwbG9tYXRpYy1taXNoYXAtY29tbWVudC02Njg3MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The AP tower: How the IDF messed up explaining why it attacked in Gaza,"The phone rang at 2 p.m. on Saturday afternoon and Jawad Mahdi answered. The person on the line speaking fluent Arabic told Mahdi that he had one hour to evacuate a building he owns in Gaza City. An Israeli airstrike was coming.

A well-known Gaza businessman who until a few years ago had a permit to enter Israel Mahdi immediately went to the al-Jalaa building a 12-story tower just two kilometers from the beach. Built in the 1990s al-Jalaa was a residential and commercial building and one of the strip’s most recognized structures. Mahdi lived there in nine apartments with his immediate and extended family he told The Jerusalem Post in a phone call from Gaza this week.

The Israeli on the phone asked Mahdi if he was the owner of al-Jalaa. Mahdi said yes.

“I am from the Shabak [Israel Security Agency]” said the man on the phone according to Mahdi. “ Hamas is in your building . We are going to destroy it. Get everyone out. You have one hour.”

Mahdi asked the Shabak agent how he can know he was telling the truth. “Am I your friend?” the Israeli agent asked the Gazan. “We are in a war. Go to all 12 floors and get everyone out.”

Mahdi listened went to the top of the building and worked his way down. He started with the Associated Press and Al Jazeera whose offices were on the top floors and continued working his way down through attorney offices medical clinics and his own family’s apartments.

The AP immediately started to work the phone. Staffers placed urgent calls to the Israeli military the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office but they were either ignored or told that there was nothing to be done. Everyone told the staffers the same thing: make sure all the workers leave the building immediately.

As the clock ticked while the inhabitants scrambled Mahdi received another phone call at 3 p.m.

“Is everyone out of the building?” the Shabak agent asked. Yes replied Mahdi but he begged for an extra 10 minutes. Some of the AP workers needed to go back in and grab a few cameras they had left behind.

“Nothing will change from 3 p.m. to 3:10 p.m.” the building owner pleaded on a video that went viral on Twitter. “The building isn’t coming back. We know that. We just want four people wearing press vests. They’re not going to get weapons. They are going to get their cameras and gear.”

“There will be no 10 minutes” the officer replied. “No one is allowed to enter the building we already gave you an hour to evacuate.”

He tried to argue further but to no avail. At last he gave up. “This is our life work and our memories” were his final words. “It is all gone. You can do whatever you want. There is a God that is greater than you.”

The Israeli responded: “pray for the Prophet” an Arabic phrase meant to ease someone’s nerves. He asked one more time if anyone was in the building. Mahdi said no. Within minutes three missiles struck. The building was gone

THE STORY of the al-Jalaa building has made international headlines and is being looked at as something of a diplomatic turning point in the Gaza conflict. Until that day the US administration stood firmly behind Israel. In statement after statement President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Israel’s right to self defense and their “unwavering support for Israel’s security.”

The bombing of AP’s Gaza bureau angered them both and the White House was quick to weigh in. “We have communicated directly to the Israelis that ensuring the safety and security of journalists and independent media is a paramount responsibility” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted.

Blinken spoke with AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt that evening and “offered his unwavering support for independent journalists and media organizations around the world” a State Department spokesman said in a statement.

The IDF issued a vague statement after the bombing saying that fighter jets had struck a multi-story building “which contained military assets belonging to the intelligence offices of the Hamas terror organization.” It said it had provided advance warning to civilians in the building allowing them to get out.

That was it. No evidence and no public statement. Diplomats in the Foreign Ministry were shocked. They had no advance knowledge of the strike against a US news agency’s offices and no one informed them. By Wednesday they had still not been privy to the intelligence file or the reason behind the bombing.

“No one told us anything” one official there said. “Israeli diplomats were being asked about this around the globe and no one had any information that it could use to explain why this had happened.”

But the IDF did not think it needed to do anything. On Monday the Post’s Lahav Harkov reported that Israel had shared intelligence with the United States a report that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed up in an interview on Face the Nation. But Blinken said he had not seen anything. Then a day later he announced that the US had received additional information.

What that information contains remains unclear. Asked a list of questions this week by the Post the IDF refused to divulge the exact nature of the threat that stemmed from the building. It claimed that Hamas’s intelligence research and development unit had offices in the building and that the unit was composed of “unique assets for the terrorist group that used sophisticated technology against the State of Israel.”

The IDF said that the unit used “these capabilities” on a number of occasions to disrupt IDF operations possibly a reference to electronic warfare. “The IDF operates in accordance with international law and takes precautions – as much as possible – to minimize harm to civilians during operations” the IDF said.

A military source said that since the attack and the heavy criticism that followed the IDF again reviewed the intelligence to ensure that a mistake was not made in targeting al-Jalaa. “We are 100% confident this was a legal target” the source said.

The targeting of the building the Post learned was approved by IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kohavi as well as by Defense Minister Benny Gantz. It came up during one of their daily meetings during the operation when they review the target bank for that day. Asked if Gantz raised any questions due to the presence of AP in the building the Defense Ministry said that it did not have a comment.

“This is the problem” explained an Israeli diplomat. “Someone should have raised a red flag and pointed out that AP is an American news agency and that an attack like this is not going to go by quietly.”

Not only did that not happen but now almost a week later Israel has still refused to reveal the intelligence file on the building and what evidence it really had before ordering the strike. AP has demanded an independent investigation.

“The evidence should have been ready to be released within five minutes after the strike” the diplomat said. “Unfortunately it wasn’t.”

IDF sources admitted this week that they may have mishandled the aftermath of the bombing.

What they failed to take into account were three factors: the first is that the bombing of a US news agency would not be something ignored by the administration or the American public.

Second the bombing was being carried out just a day after the IDF had been accused of deceiving the foreign media with breaking news – that turned out to be false – of a ground incursion into Gaza possibly used to then bomb Hamas’s underground “Metro” tunnel network. With the bombing of the AP office not only did the IDF look like it was deceiving the media; it was now attacking it too.

Finally the IDF failed to recognize the immediate need to shape the post-bombing narrative. By issuing a laconic statement without providing any evidence the IDF left the field wide open to other stories. And into that breach marched a host of false narratives that overwhelmed the story Israel was trying to tell.

It was similar to what happened in May 2010 when navy commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara Turkish flotilla on its way to Gaza. The commandos were brutally attacked when they fast-roped onto the ship’s upper deck. Some were stabbed; others were thrown into the water. When they defended themselves and killed nine of the attackers the story in the international media was how Israel had killed humanitarian activists bringing aid to Gaza.

It took hours until the video of the boarding – which clearly showed the armed attack – was finally released. But it was too late: the narrative of Israel being the attacker the aggressor and the murderers had already set in.

Is al-Jalaa a similar case? To some it seems so. Israel has made claims and said that there were Hamas assets in the building but has provided no evidence to back that up. Contacted this week to ask if that would change the IDF said that it might but only after the operation ended.

If the military thinks that putting out evidence more than a week after the bombing will change public opinion then we really have a problem. •",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5va2xhaG9tYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wNS8yMy90dWxzYS1yYWNlLW1hc3NhY3JlLWNlbnRlbm5pYWwtZXZlbnRzLWhpc3RvcmljLWdyZWVud29vZC1sYW5kbWFya3MtbXVzdC1zZWUvNzM4NTQ4NTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 historic Greenwood landmarks to see as the Tulsa centennial nears,"TULSA — The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission is preparing to unveil its primary brick-and-mortar project Greenwood Rising: The Black Wall Street History Center on June 2 as one of its numerous events scheduled in the coming days to mark the 100th anniversary of the tragedy.

The $18.6 million 11000-square-foot history center is joining several other monuments memorials and landmarks in the historic Greenwood District that help chronicle the history of the Tulsa Race Massacre.

""It's an all-inclusive history center that will utilize technology visuals photographs videos all to encapsulate the history"" said Phil Armstrong project director for the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission.

The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre is now recognized as one of the worst acts of racial violence in American history. Between May 31 and June 1 1921 mobs of white residents attacked set aflame and ultimately destroyed the Greenwood District which was at that time one of the wealthiest Black communities in the United States earning it the name ""Black Wall Street.""

Along with Greenwood Rising the commission is planning the ribbon-cutting Friday for another new landmark: the Pathway to Hope which will connect the Greenwood District to nearby John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park.

""It will be a walking path from Greenwood Avenue over to Elgin (Avenue) that ... will feature some of the icons of Greenwood to view on a new retaining wall that they have built with African American art with landscaping with shade trees with park benches to sit and reflect upon this history"" Armstrong said.

He said the commission is looking forward to directing visitors that come to the new attractions to the area's existing landmarks too.

""When they come to history center ... we will guide them and let them know 'Now that you've seen the history go and walk and experience the history'"" he said. ""It's really going to be exceptional that people could come here and just see all these sites that have been placed and have been here for quite some time that we can bring awareness to.""

Here are 10 must-see landmarks to visit in and across Tulsa's historic Greenwood District:

1. Greenwood Cultural Center

The Greenwood Cultural Center is the flame-keeper not only for Tulsa Race Massacre history but also for the Greenwood District's prosperous pre-massacre Black Wall Street era as well as its remarkable resurgence in the months and years following the tragedy.

The nonprofit organization's mission is to promote preserve and celebrate African American culture and heritage through exhibitions events and educational programming.

Dedicated as a Literary Landmark in 2018 the park honors John Hope Franklin a historian civil rights advocate Oklahoma Cultural Treasure and Medal of Freedom recipient who died in 2009.

The park memorializes the Tulsa Race Massacre with two large-scale works by renowned Denver sculptor Ed Dwight. At the park's entry ""Hope Plaza"" is a 16-foot granite structure that encapsulates three larger-than-life bronze sculptures representing actual pictures from the massacre: ""Hostility"" a white man armed for assault​; ""Humiliation"" a Black man with his hands raised in surrender; and ""Hope"" the white American Red Cross director holding a Black baby.

The second sculpture ""Tower of Reconciliation"" a 25-foot-tall tower chronicling African American history was named last year by National Geographic one of six U.S. monuments people should visit.

""So that's definitely worthy stop"" said Lauren Snedden vice president of marketing and communications for Tulsa Regional Tourism.

3. Vernon AME Church

Founded in 1905 the Vernon AME Church is the only standing Black-owned structure on Greenwood Avenue from the Black Wall Street era and one of the few edifices to survive the race massacre.

5. Mabel B. Little Heritage House

Located on the grounds of the Greenwood Cultural Center the Mabel B. Little Heritage House is the only home built in the Greenwood District in the early 1920s that is still standing. It was originally built and owned by Tulsa Race Massacre survivors Sam and Lucy Mackey a few years after their previous home was destroyed in the tragedy.

In 1986 the Mackey House was relocated and renamed in honor of Little a race massacre survivor and local entrepreneur author and icon.

The house now is a museum as well as the location for one of two Greenwood District benches that are part of the Toni Morrison Society's Bench by the Road Project a memorial history and community outreach initiative. Taken from a 1989 interview with the author who died in 2019 the program seeks to establish historical markers across the United States and around the world to help remember the lives of Africans who were enslaved. The other bench in the district is at Greenwood Avenue and Archer Street.

6. Mount Zion Baptist Church

At the time of the Tulsa Race Massacre Mount Zion Baptist Church was the newest building in Greenwood having been dedicated on April 4 1921 after five years of construction. Falsely identified as a warehouse for arms during the massacre it was burned and mostly destroyed.

The congregation was determined to rebuild in Greenwood and after paying off its debt raising the funds and four years of construction the new three-story late Gothic Revival building was dedicated on Oct. 21 1952.

Part of the original 1921 brick church remains at the ground level and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

7. Black Wall Street Memorial

Dedicated during commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the race massacre the Black Wall Street Memorial has carved in gleaming black stone the names of the hundreds of Black-owned businesses once nestled in Greenwood. Another slab details the millions in unpaid financial claims from the massacre.

On the grounds of the Greenwood Cultural Center the memorial stands as a symbol of Black excellence and entrepreneurship.

8. Greenwood murals

Tulsa artist Chris ""Sker"" Rogers envisioned the mural that artist Donald ""Scribe"" Ross painted on the Greenwood Cultural Center wall in 2018. One of the first projects of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission which provided funding and support through the Greenwood Cultural Center Armstrong said the striking painting has become world-famous as it has been regularly shared on social media.

But it's not the only public art in the district: The phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" is painted in tall yellow letters in the Vernon AME Church parking lot; the Tulsa Drillers recently dedicated a large-scale portrait of Jackie Robinson — a collaboration between Rogers and Thomas ""Detour"" Evans — overlooking ONEOK Field; and other murals are scattered across the district.

9. Tulsa Race Massacre Memorial Tree

An American Elm that has been growing in Greenwood for nearly 100 years was officially designated the Tulsa Race Massacre Memorial Tree in an April outdoor ceremony as part of the centennial commemoration.

The elegantly twisted tree outside Carver Middle School is meant to be a ""living monument"" to the resilience of the community.

10. Black-owned businesses

""We like to point people to the local Black-owned businesses ... when they're in town. So from getting a meal at Wanda J's (Next Generation restaurant) to visiting Black Wall Street Tees & Souvenirs to grabbing a coffee at Black Wall Street Liquid Lounge you can certainly make a full day's itinerary around Greenwood when you come to learn about the Tulsa Race Massacre"" Snedden said.

Other Black-owned businesses in and across Greenwood include The Loc Shop salon Tee's Barber Shop and the one-of-a-kind sneaker shop Silhouette Sneakers & Art.

But for those interested in heritage tourism or Indigenous culture in the United States immersing yourself can be done safely and simply outside.

With a focus on the outdoors or open-air experiences these eight parks heritage centers and exhibits offer fresh opportunities to confront not just the history but also the present-day realities of Native Americans. Visitors can also meet listen to and learn from tribal members who are emerging as crucial liaisons in these outdoor spaces.

“I’m lucky to be working in a time when people want to acknowledge the history” said Samantha Odegard a member of the Pezihutazizi Oyate or Dakota Nation in Minnesota. As one of 200 Tribal Historic Preservation Officers in the United States Ms. Odegard 38 advises federal agencies on how to protect sacred sites in public areas.

Native Americans “are on every inch of this continent” Odegard said. “Whatever piece of public land you’re standing on chances are there’s something there.”"

Owning a lavish property in affluent Beverly Hills has become the prerequisite for becoming a Real Housewives star and luckily for us Crystal’s pad certainly fits the bill.

According to ET Online The Minkoffs live in a 9000 sq ft Bel-Air mansion that boasts “a pool exotic antiques and busts from the original Lion King movie”. On Instagram Crystal is often seen enjoying the pool in the family’s spacious garden and in one post shared shots of her vintage living room filled with lush leather sofas and classic Hollywood posters.

Apple now says that both the HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after a future software update. That’ll be good news to people who’ve invested in one or a pair of Apple’s smart speakers. Two HomePods grouped in stereo playing a lossless source? Yeah that’s going to sound wonderful. Apple isn’t yet giving any timetable for when this software update will be released however.

The document also clarifies that the Apple TV 4K will only support standard lossless audio when the ALAC files become available in June. Apple has said that in most cases the “Hi-Res Lossless” tier will require external devices like a USB DAC.

Apple uses the document to tout its “commitment” to providing customers with the best possible listening experience. It talks up both AAC — claiming that the format has become “virtually indistinguishable from the original studio recording” as encoding methods have evolved — and its Apple Digital Masters initiative. I continue to think that Apple is much more excited about spatial audio and Dolby Atmos mixes coming to Apple Music than anything to do with lossless itself.

The document also reiterates what Apple told The Verge earlier this week in regards to the AirPods Max: when listening to audio via the Lightning-to-3.5mm cable the company says it’ll sound fantastic but it won’t technically be “lossless” due to an analog to digital conversion that occurs in the cable. Apple again confirms that lossless quality will be exclusive to Apple Music:

Can I redownload my iTunes purchases in lossless? If you subscribe to Apple Music you can redownload music in lossless only from the Apple Music catalog.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvcGFwZXItc2hvb3QtY2FtZXJhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This $120 Point-and-Shoot Digital Camera Is for Film Lovers,"Our phones give us the ability to take footage of our entire lives. Unlike previous generations we can document our world endlessly with no need to carry a camera or pay—and wait—to get film developed. And yet the resulting photos are not nearly as good as what we got with film. Digital images are too posed too hi-def. When I look at an iPhone photo instead of appreciating the moment I’m staring at all the flaws the camera has amplified.

I recently watched Kid 90 the Hulu documentary by Soleil Moon Frye (aka Punky Brewster) and was overcome by how much amazing footage she had from her life. She filmed and photographed everything around her and the documentary left me feeling nostalgic for a life I didn’t live. I feel something similar every time I see a great film photograph of someone doing nothing special like sitting at the desk in their first dorm room hanging out on a road trip with friends or moving into a new apartment.

Enter the Paper Shoot digital camera a device that approximates the feel and aesthetic of a film camera without the hassle of developing. I started seeing the Paper Shoot Camera on TikTok a few months ago. As a film fan who was craving a more immediate experience—I use film cameras regularly but buying and developing film is pricey and takes forever—I knew this device was exactly what I needed.

Aesthetically Pleasing





1 / 5 Chevron Chevron Photograph: Medea Giordano Photo taken using Paper Shoot Camera's black and white setting.

Like an old-school analog camera there are no screens on the Paper Shoot. When you're taking pictures with it you stay in the moment without feeling like you have to instantly check that the photos are good (and then probably retake them). Remember when we just had to have faith that it would turn out OK? Instead you transfer the shots to your computer via the SD card later. The company recommends using a card with 32 gigabytes of storage.

The actual photos look like film too. The camera's 13-megapixel image sensor produces big photos that have a great old-school feel with just a little bit of grain. There are four photo options: regular color black and white sepia tone and blue tone. Whichever you choose you’ll capture a memory beautifully without the extreme high-definition of your phone. There's no flash so indoor photos need natural light and night photos may be slightly blurred. But I liked the effect these limitations had on my photos.

Other than the little switch on the back that flips between those color settings there's nothing else to mess with. The only other button on the Paper Shoot is the shutter which is placed on the front of the camera right where your pointer finger naturally wants to sit when holding it.

DIY and Pocket-Sized

You assemble the Paper Shoot yourself. Photograph: Medea Giordano

These cameras come as a few separate pieces: the slim circuit board which has a cavity for two AAA batteries (rechargeable ones are recommended) and the stiff case cut out of “stone paper” a material made from powdered stone that's been pressed into a sheet. It's neat to be able to see inside the camera and do a little bit of the work of putting it together although the assembly is basic. It also comes with a paper strap but I prefer to go without it.",,,,,,

Do they stand for free speech the rule of law and human rights — or for primarily making money?

Over the past 30 years Western leaders have dreamed they lived in an earthly paradise where they could stand for both. But the ruling Communist Party of China under paramount leader Xi Jinping is now making it increasingly clear that if you want to do business with his country you’d best embrace the party line.

Take Apple. The world’s most valuable brand is a powerhouse in Washington DC maintaining armies of lawyers and making large donations to the political parties and to lobby organizations like the US-China Business Council. It has instant entrée to the White House Congress and any other center of American power.

In 2001 Apple closed its California production lines dismissed its American workers and moved production to China where investment subsidies were high wages low and labor unions and environmental rules nonexistent. Apple has since admitted to avoiding $41 billion in US taxes. Now the tech giant — led by CEO Tim Cook — has truly made out like a bandit becoming the world’s most valuable corporation in the process.

More than a decade later the FBI was investigating cases of domestic terrorism and desperately needed to crack information on captured US-owned iPhones. Despite FBI demands and court orders Apple refused to assist. FBI tech experts did eventually manage to open the phones but no thanks to Apple.

Contrast Apple’s refusal to help the FBI with its actions during the Hong Kong free speech demonstrations in 2019. Apple’s app Hong Kong Map-LiveHKmap.live enabled freedom demonstrators to track police in the city. But after the People’s Daily newspaper which is controlled by the Chinese Community Party expressed outrage over the app Apple suddenly removed it from its store saying that it was doing so “voluntarily.”

What’s more a New York Times report this month revealed that Apple has ceded legal ownership of its customers’ data in China to a company controlled by Chinese government officials. The analysis also found that roughly 55000 active apps including ones that give users access to news private messaging and websites blocked by the Chinese government have vanished from Apple’s App Store in China since 2017. “Just as Mr. Cook figured out how to make China work for Apple China is making Apple work for the Chinese government” the report concluded.

Cook is a champion of liberal causes like LGBTQ rights Black Lives Matter and extra easy voting methods in America. But nary a word escapes his lips regarding human rights for the marginalized Uyghurs of China or voting rights for the undermined citizens of Hong Kong.

Nor is this forked tongue malady limited to global CEOs. Prime Ministers like New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern and Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel have struggled not to say anything more negative about China than that it is raising “grave human rights concerns.” Of course New Zealand exports meat and milk to China while Germany exports cars and machinery.

Ultimately the issue is crystal clear. How many iPhones how much milk how many Mercedes are worth the loss of free speech and rule of law demanded by Beijing?

Neither German Chancellor Angela Merkel or New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have stood up to China. Getty Images

The Chinese Communist Party uses the economic dependence of corporations and other countries on the Chinese market to discipline and bend them to the party’s will.

Free-world leaders must find ways to reduce their dependence on China. Australia is already showing how as it begins to successfully diversify its markets. A free-world buying consortium could extend this entrepreneurial approach with democratic countries creating a fund for buying and redistributing free-world exports being blocked by Beijing. Similarly they could provide incentives as Japan is already doing for diversifying production and assembly operations away from China. Initially some costs might rise but surely improving human rights on a global scale is worth something.

As for US corporations like Apple they must be put on notice that they can’t run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. CEOs who champion civil rights at home should be called out for sabotaging them abroad.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Companies With The Most Cash Reserves In America.

The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the economy in a way that no one thought possible. Back when the economy of the United States crashed in 2008 - 2009 and the rest of the world followed suit few people thought they would face an even worse disaster in 202o just over a decade later. But that is what happened in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic which originated in China spread across the world leading to over 170 million cases as well more than 3.5 million deaths. These figures themselves are likely to be extremely understated and we will know the true impact of Covid-19 in the coming years.

As countries started imposing lockdowns to battle this virus for which they had no solution economies which are entirely dependent on lockdowns well not happening. Most industries faced significant losses as economies collapsed and most countries across the globe entered into either recessions or depressions. Many companies had to incur massive losses as well as major layoffs as demand for most industries fell and going at the same rate as pre-pandemic made no sense at all.

Even though as I mentioned most industries and companies suffered some actually came out of the pandemic smelling like roses. Take Tesla for example. The market cap of the company jumped astronomically during 2020 making even ordinary shareholders into millionaires and making Elon Musk the richest man in the world and the highest earning billionaire in 2020 as well as the richest man in the world for a while. Tech companies generally managed quite well in fact with many companies reporting higher sales and profits as demand for tech increased while more and more people continued to work from home.

Another example is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America. Apple Inc has nearly $200 billion in cash and marketable securities. One would think that with a large number of its stores closed Apple would have suffered dearly during the crisis. Fortunately for Apple Inc. (AAPL) shareholders the company did well during the past 12 months and AAPL shares performed even better. The company used some of its cash hoard to continue paying dividends and buy back shares. Apple Inc. should have used its massive cash hoard to snatch some EV and battery companies on the cheap.

Another technology stock that is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America is Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook Inc carries more than $60 billion in cash on its books and despite this huge buffer Facebook shares declined all the way down to $140 in March 2020. Mr. Market misjudged Facebook's potential for a few days but investors had a change of heart after a few weeks and Facebook shares returned more than 120% since its March 2020 lows. Unfortunately Facebook Inc's management didn't put its huge cash hoard into good use and take advantage of the opportunities.

Most of the companies that made our list of the 15 companies with the highest cash reserves in America are tech companies but you can also find non-technology stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Ford (NYSE:F) on our list. Costco was one of the beneficiaries of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic but JP Morgan Chase and Ford shares suffered large losses despite their cash reserves.

It would make sense that tech companies have massive cash reserves. Due to the high value of shares of these companies as well as the fact that their products are generally highly priced with significant margins these companies tend to have a lot of surplus cash on hand. However having a lot of excess cash can also be often considered to be a failure on the part of the company to have the cash simply lying around when it could be put to better use say on investing activities or to pay off debts which would allow the company to save significant money on interest payments. On the other hand having too little cash can give the signal that the company has liquidity issues and can also be perceived negatively by investors and shareholders. Therefore there is a fine balance to maintain one which many companies are able to maintain while others are not.

However in the era of Covid where the economy needs significant boosts it is frustrating many people including Wall Street that companies are sitting on massive piles of cash and yet are refusing to utilize it. As I mentioned earlier companies can use it for investing activities as well as acquisitions or by returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends which would gain them goodwill in an unprecedented year. Another option is buyback of shares from shareholders though detractors argue that this is simply a short term boost for investors while resulting in a long term effect on the health of a company.

Of course the simple reason would be that this isn't the best time really to spend money. The market is uncertain the economy will take a while to recover and while there is optimism on the horizon with vaccines being administered it is still a long haul process and not an immediate one. Hence companies are a bit cautious in investing money. Further the biggest companies in the world are also really big on acquisitions with Apple acquiring a hundred companies over the last 6 months. That means an acquisition every three to four weeks. Furthermore tech companies famous for having a lot of cash on hand are also known for sitting on said cash. And even though this doesn't mean that these companies are not spending cash at all it's just that many analysts believe that these companies are not doing as much as they do.

Coming up with the list of companies with the largest cash reserves in America was not an easy task. Search on the internet and you'll generally find tech companies and even then those articles are often outdated. Most people want to know the reserves that companies have now one year after the Covid-19 pandemic rather than back in 2019 or 2018. Hence we selected the biggest companies from the Fortune Global 500 list and focused particularly on the tech industry as it is true that these companies tend to have the most cash. We have selected the latest quarterly reports for each company and scoured the balance sheet to find out the cash reserves that these companies own. Due to the high liquidity of marketable securities we have considered them among cash equivalents as well though most other types of investments including long term investments have not been considered. Together these companies hold more than $1.1 trillion in cash alone which is truly an astonishing amount. So without further ado let's take a look at the companies which combined have more cash than most countries in the world starting with number 15:

Cook testified for more than two hours in Oakland California as the closing witness in Apple's defense against Epic's charges that the iPhone maker's App Store controls and commissions have created a monopoly that Apple illegally abuses.

App makers including music service Spotify Technology  European regulators and US politicians who question whether the company that once urged the world to 'think different' has now become too big and too powerful.

At the end of testimony Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers questioned Cook pressing him to concede that game developers generate most App Store revenue and help subsidize other apps on the store that pay no commission.

Gonzalez said the profits Apple reaps from game developers ""appear to be disproportionate.""

""I understand this notion that somehow Apple is bringing the customer to the dance"" she said. ""But after that first time after that first interaction the developers are keeping customers with the game. Apple is just profiting from that it seems me.""

Cook disagreed. ""The free apps bring a lot to the table. Only the people who are really profiting in a major way are paying 30"" percent commissions he said.

Epic has tried to show that Apple's iPhone is a lucrative platform that locks in users pointing to an internal Apple document that Epic alleges showed the App Store had 78% operating margins. Cook said the document did not reflect the full costs of running the App Store.

The testimony constitutes Cook's most extensive public remarks on the App Store which anchors Apple's $53.8 billion services business.

Gonzalez Rogers also cited a survey that found 39% of software developers were unhappy with Apple's app distribution services.

""It doesn't seem to me that you feel pressure or competition to actually change the manner in which you act with developers"" Gonzalez Rogers said.

Cook replied that ""we turn the place upside down"" to respond to developer complaints but later conceded that he does not receive regular reports on how developers feel about working with Apple.

At the start of the three-week trial Gonzalez Rogers also pressed Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney with tough questions https://www.reuters.com/technology/judge-presses-epic-ceo-during-second-day-apple-antitrust-trial-2021-05-04 on how forcing Apple to change would ripple through the software world. Sweeney said he had not thought the issue through.

The maker of ""Fortnite"" an online game which pits players against in each other in an animated ""Battle Royale"" fight to the last survivor has waged a public relations and legal campaign against Apple.

Epic parodied Apple's iconic ""1984"" commercial and argued in court that it acts anticompetitively by only allowing approved apps on the world's 1 billion iPhones and forcing developers to use Apple's in-app payment system which charges sales commissions of up to 30%.

Apple has sought to persuade Gonzalez Rogers that its rules for developers are aimed at keeping its customers' information private and safe from malware.

""We have a maniacal focus on the user and doing the right thing by the customer"" Cook said. ""Safety and security are the foundation that privacy is built on. Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data from people and we like to provide people with tools to circumvent that.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIxL21heS8yMi9pZi1hcHBsZS1pcy10aGUtb25seS1vcmdhbmlzYXRpb24tY2FwYWJsZS1vZi1kZWZlbmRpbmctb3VyLXByaXZhY3ktaXQtcmVhbGx5LWlzLXRpbWUtdG8td29ycnnSAZMBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2NvbW1lbnRpc2ZyZWUvMjAyMS9tYXkvMjIvaWYtYXBwbGUtaXMtdGhlLW9ubHktb3JnYW5pc2F0aW9uLWNhcGFibGUtb2YtZGVmZW5kaW5nLW91ci1wcml2YWN5LWl0LXJlYWxseS1pcy10aW1lLXRvLXdvcnJ5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If Apple is the only organisation capable of defending our privacy it really is time to worry,"A few weeks ago Apple dropped its long-promised bombshell on the data-tracking industry. The latest version (14.5) of iOS – the operating system of the iPhone – included a provision that required app users explicitly to confirm that they wished to be tracked across the internet in their online activities. At the heart of the switch is a code known as “the identifier for advertisers” or IDFA. It turns out that every iPhone comes with one of these identifiers the object of which is to provide hucksters with aggregate data about the user’s interests. For years iPhone users had had the option to switch it off by digging into the privacy settings of their devices but because they’re human very few had bothered to do that.

From 14.5 onwards however they couldn’t avoid making a decision and you didn’t have to be a Nobel laureate to guess that most iPhone users would opt out. Which explains why those who profit from the data-tracking racket had for months been going apeshit about Apple’s perfidy. Some of the defensive PR mounted on their behalf for example Facebook’s weeping about the impact on small defenceless businesses defied parody. Other counteroffensives included attacks on Apple’s monopolistic control over its App store and charges of rank hypocrisy – that changes in version 14.5 were not motivated by Apple’s concerns for users’ privacy but by its own plans to enter the advertising business. And so on.

It will be a while until we know for sure whether the apocalyptic fears of the data-trackers were accurate. It takes time for most iPhone users to install operating system updates and so these are still relatively early days. But the first figures are promising. One data analytics company for example has found that in the early weeks the daily opt-out rate for American users has been about 94%. This is much higher than surveys conducted in the run-up to the change had suggested – one had estimated an opt-out rate closer to 60%.

If the opt-out rate is as high as we’ve seen so far then it’s bad news for the data-tracking racket which the Financial Times estimates to be a $350bn industry and good news for humanity.

The computerised high-speed auction system in which online ads are traded seems not to be compatible with the law – and is currently unregulated. That is the conclusion of a remarkable recent investigation by two legal scholars Michael Veale and Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius who set out to examine whether this “real-time bidding” (RTB) system conforms to European data-protection law. They asked whether RTB complies with three rules of the European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) – the requirement for a legal basis transparency and security. They showed that for each of the requirements most RTB practices do not comply. “Indeed” they wrote “it seems close to impossible to make RTB comply.” So they concluded it needs to be regulated.

An online system has been running wild for years generating billions in profits for its participants

It does. Often the problem with tech regulation is that our legal systems need to be overhauled to deal with digital technology. But the irony in this particular case is that there’s no need for such an overhaul: Europe already has the law in place. It’s the GDPR which is part of the legal code of every EU country and has provision for swingeing punishments for infringers. The problem is that it’s not being effectively enforced.

Why not? The answer is that the EU delegates regulatory power to the relevant institutions – in this case data protection authorities – of its member states. And these local outfits are overwhelmed by the scale of the task and are lamentably under-resourced for it. Half of Europe’s DPAs have only five technical experts or fewer. And the Irish data protection authority on whose patch most of the tech giants have their European HQs has the heaviest enforcement workload in Europe and is clearly swamped.

So here’s where we are: an online system has been running wild for years generating billions in profits for its participants. We have evidence of its illegitimacy and a powerful law on the statute book that in principle could bring it under control but which we appear unable to enforce. And the only body that has to date been able to exert real control over the aforementioned racket is… a giant private company that itself is subject to serious concerns about its monopolistic behaviour. And the question for today: where is democracy in all this? You only have to ask to know the answer.

ADM,Archer-Daniels-Midland,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9ydW0uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3NveWJlYW5zLWFuZC1ncmVlbi1kaWVzZWwtd2lsbC1jb21iaW5lLWluLWEtYmlnLXdheS10aHJvdWdoLTItbm9ydGgtZGFrb3RhLXBsYW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Soybeans and 'green diesel' will combine in a big way through 2 North Dakota plants,"FARGO — The recent announcement of a $350 million soybean processing plant at an industrial complex in Spiritwood N.D. was heralded by politicians as a major new market for farmers that will benefit the state.

But the project slated for completion in 2023 has another big winner: the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery near Dickinson 200 miles to the west and along the same rail line.

Marathon has converted the refinery so that its entire production now involves making renewable diesel a fuel that is equivalent to conventional diesel but with a much lower carbon footprint that is increasingly in demand especially in California which offers financial incentives for low-carbon fuels.

And a major feedstock for the renewable diesel — sometimes called green diesel — at Marathon’s Dickinson refinery will be soybean oil from the Archer Daniels Midland Co. refinery in Spiritwood according to officials including a legislative leader.

Marathon has not publicly disclosed any plans to use soybean oil feedstock from the ADM plant once available but when the soybean plant was announced Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goerhing said plans called for the soybean oil to be shipped to a refinery in western North Dakota to make renewable fuel.

Only one refinery fits that description — the Marathon refinery near Dickinson said David Ripplinger an economist at North Dakota State University who studies biofuels.

Also Sen. Rich Wardner R-Dickinson the majority leader of the North Dakota Senate said local officials in Dickinson recently were briefed by Marathon about its plans to use soybean oil from the Spiritwood processing plant.

“They’re looking forward to doing business with that ADM plant at Spiritwood” he said.

RELATED:

Marathon has disclosed plans to buy wind power from five turbines that will provide 45% of the Dickinson refinery’s electricity.

A Marathon spokesman declined to comment on plans to use ADM soybean oil in its plant but Marathon previously has announced that the Dickinson refinery will use corn and soybeans to make renewable diesel. “We don’t typically provide comment on those types of commercial matters” Marathon communication manager Jamal Kheiry said referring to its fuel feedstock source.

Using wind power will help reduce the carbon footprint of the renewable diesel the refinery produces — entitling it to carbon credits from the state of California that will increase profitability Ripplinger said.

“That really helps their carbon footprint and it increases the price of the product” Wardner said. “They get premium dollar for their product because it practically has no carbon footprint at all.”

Also the ADM soybean processing plant in Spiritwood will use waste steam from the Dakota Spirit ethanol plant a neighboring facility at the 550-acre Spiritwood Energy Park 10 miles east of Jamestown.

That likely would further reduce the carbon footprint of green diesel that will be produced at the Marathon refinery Ripplinger said making the association between the refinery and the soybean plant highly advantageous.

“It’s a great opportunity for North Dakota farmers” he said. “It’s a great opportunity for ADM and Marathon. It’s a really great deal.”

Wardner agreed and noted the two plants are not far apart and are connected to the same rail line which will decrease shipping costs for the soybean oil used to make green diesel. “It’s ideal” he said.

Besides its low-carbon footprint green diesel offers other advantages over biodiesel because it is equivalent to petroleum diesel Wardner and Ripplinger said. That means vehicles that run on diesel don’t have to be converted to burn green diesel and the same tanks and pipelines can be used to store or carry both fuels.

“It seems like the renewable diesel is really getting to be sought after” Wardner said.

The refining industry is making a huge shift toward green diesel moving away from biodiesel Ripplinger said.

“It’s going to expand” he said. “That’s what everybody’s looking at. You’re going to see a tremendous increase in renewable diesel.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The production capacity of the refinery and soybean crushing plant suggests that the Marathon refinery will be a major customer of the ADM plant Ripplinger said.

The soybean crushing plant will be able to process up to 150000 bushels per day and the refinery can produce 12000 barrels of renewable diesel per day.

“It matches almost perfectly” he said. “Absolutely everything points in that direction” meaning a close relationship between the refinery and soybean plant.

Soybean oil is the leading feedstock for renewable diesel Ripplinger said but other vegetable oils including canola oil as well as animal fats can be used.

The industry is moving away from conventional biofuels including biodiesel and toward green diesel because the incentives increase profitability. But the refining process to make renewable diesel equivalent to petroleum processing is much more involved and capital intensive so it requires a higher return Ripplinger said.

The ADM plant will provide a market for about 25% of the soybeans North Dakota grows Ripplinger said and likely will capture essentially all of the soybeans within a 100-mile radius of the plant.

The big shift toward green diesel and the popularity of soybeans as a feedstock mean that in the coming years there likely will be more refineries dedicated to producing renewable diesel Ripplinger said. It’s possible that another plant could be built on the northern Plains but it’s not clear whether North Dakota would be chosen he said.

Last year North Dakota was ranked ninth in the nation among soybean growing states producing 190 million bushels. North Dakota is the second-ranked petroleum state behind Texas and ranks 10th in wind energy production.

North Dakota also is making significant investments to try to make it economically feasible to capture and store carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants. Some of the carbon emissions could be used to help pump oil from North Dakota’s Bakken formation.

“Things like this kind of put North Dakota in the center of the universe” Ripplinger said.

Now most of North Dakota’s soybeans are shipped overseas as a protein source. Having the Spiritwood crushing plant he said will enable North Dakota growers to capture more of the economic value of their crop.

For that reason Gov. Doug Burgum called the recent ADM announcement a “game-changer.” He also has predicted that the state’s agriculture and energy industries will increasingly overlap.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tous les observateurs et les organisations internationales spécialisées se félicitent des efforts consentis et des progrès considérables enregistrés par le Vietnam dans la réduction de l’écart des sexes tant en matière d’éducation d’emploi que dans la participation à la vie politique a déclaré l'ambassadeur du Maroc Jamale Chouaibi à l’Agence Vietnammienne d’Information (VNA).

Le taux de femmes occupant des postes de direction est en nette progression dans de nombreux secteurs et organes comme en témoigne la représentation proportionnelle à la XIVe législature avec un taux de 268% supérieur à la moyenne au niveau asiatique de 19%.

Le taux élevé d’occupation des sièges de l'Assemblée nationale (AN) par les députées et la proportion de 45% des candidatures aux élections de la XVe législature soumises par des candidates sont un signe positif qui favoriserait davantage l’autonomisation des femmes et leur contribution active dans les organisations et les politiques de développement du Vietnam.

La promotion du rôle de la femme est illustrée également par la 2e position qu’occupe le Vietnam en Asie du Sud-Est en terme de femmes propriétaires d’entreprises ou assurant des postes de direction dans diverses firmes ou grands groupes privés ou étatiques.

On peut dire que les femmes élues ont apporté de nombreuses contributions au développement socio-économique du Vietnam au fil des années. Dans cette interview le diplomate marocain a également apprécié la mise en œuvre de politique de la grande union nationale au Vietnam.

Les efforts déployés par le leadership vietnamien en vue d’assurer une représentativité adéquate pour les minorités ethniques à l’AN ont été toujours loués appréciés et reconnus par nombre d’observateurs a-t-il indiqué.

Des avancées importantes ont été réalisées dans l’intégration et l’association des représentants de ces minorités dans le processus d’élaboration de lois et la supervision de la mise en œuvre des différents programmes de développement socio-économiques initiés par le gouvernement vietnamien pour la mise à niveau des régions et zones habitées par les minorités ethniques a-t-il précisé.

Saluer les préparatifs des élections

Le 23 mai est un jour très important pour le Vietnam. C’est le jour où 69.198.594 électeurs à travers le pays se rendront dans 84.767 circonscriptions pour exercer leur droit de maître afin de choisir leurs propres députés de l'AN de la XVe législature et les membres des Conseils populaires à tous les niveaux pour le mandat 2021-2026.

À cette occasion l’ambassadeur Jamale Chouaibi a salué les préparatifs pour ces prochaines élections dans le contexte où le Vietnam doit faire face aux évolutions complexes de l’épidémie de COVID-19.

Il a déclaré que les élections des députés pour la XVe AN et des membres des Conseils populaires à tous les niveaux pour le mandat 2021- 2026 du Vietnam prévues le 23 mai prochain se dérouleront certes dans un contexte difficile marqué par l’évolution imprévisible de l’épidémie de COVID-19.

Toutefois les mesures proactives et préventives prises par le gouvernement vietnamien l’étroite coordination entre les autorités centrales provinciales et locales et la bonne organisation de la campagne électorale à travers le recours aux moyens de communication modernes sont autant de facteurs devant à assurer le déroulement de cet évènement politique majeur dans un climat sain et serein a-t-il estimé.

Selon le diplomate marocain le Vietnam compte à ce jour parmi les rares pays à avoir réussi le double objectif de contrôler l’épidémie de COVID-19 tout en assurant la continuité de la croissance économique.

Dans la lutte contre le COVID-19 le Vietnam s'est montré exemplaire et a su réagir efficacement tout en étant innovant. Le plan de soutien économique et social mis en place par le gouvernement vietnamien en réponse à cette épidémie a été hautement apprécié par de nombreuses institutions internationales qui ont mis en avant l’exception économique du Vietnam dans cette conjoncture difficile a-t-il conclu.

Leo Lukenas III a former Green Beret who was part of the bank’s Financial Institutions Group died of “acute coronary artery thrombus” at age 35 last Thursday according to a Reuters report. He leaves behind a wife and two young children.

His death came after he had allegedly been working some 100 hours a week for several weeks in a row on a $2 billion merger that was completed last Monday — three days before his tragic death.

Much of the outcry on social media site Reddit from purported bank staffers has been directed at Lukenas’ boss Gary Howe co-head of the financial institutions group. Howe took down his LinkedIn page during the last few days.

Some employees have reportedly messaged each other about a possible walkout in an effort to bargain for better working conditions according to popular financial website and chat board Wall Street Oasis.

One post from an anonymous banker highlighted a list of demands for employees’ welfare that generated more than 450 comments in response.

The demands include “proactive policies” that cap work schedules at an average of 80 hours over a seven-day period and that employees get at least one weekend off per month. It also called for an investigation into Lukenas’ death.

So far workers have remained at their desks — in part because they fear retribution for raising concerns about the toxic culture sources said.

A Bank of America spokesperson did not comment about a possible walkout or the accusations of retribution when reached by The Post.

The rep said the bank has no plans to take any action against Howe or to investigate complaints that its junior bankers are forced to put in 100-hour weeks.

“We are very saddened by the loss of our teammate. We continue to focus on doing whatever we can to support the family and our team especially those who worked closely with him” the BoA spokesperson told The Post.

Howe did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Lukena who lived in Brooklyn had been a Green Beret for more than a decade — from 2013 until he joined the bank as a full-time employee last July — according to his LinkedIn page. He posted news about the deal between UMB Financial and Heartland Financial on LinkedIn days before his death.

He was a member of 51 Vets a nonprofit dedicated to connecting transitioning and transitioned veterans from elite military communities with leading businesses according to its website.

“51 Vets completely changed the trajectory of my post military career. Outstanding organization with an incredible mission” Lukenas had recently posted on LinkedIn.

A fundraiser for his family launched by 51 Vets has already raised $258962 as of early Thursday afternoon including $10000 from hedge fund titan Bill Ackman.

“This was an organic campaign organized by our members” 51 Vets founder Jordan Selleck told The Post. “This speaks to the pain in the veteran community and Leo’s reputation in the community.”

“On May 2nd 2024 51 Vets lost a father husband son Green Beret and member” 51 Vets says on its site. “Leo left behind a wife and two young children. Leo spent over a decade in Army Special Operations deploying multiple times with 1st Special Forces Group. He was dedicated to everything he did never settling for good enough. He always set the example and held himself to the highest standards prioritizing the team and mission success over himself.”

Lukenas’ dedication to work is why some on Wall Street are quick to link his passing to a culture they believe values wealth over well-being.

While there is no direct evidence to suggest his work had anything to do with his death numerous studies have linked acute stress to thrombosis.

Lukenas’ shocking death reopened a longstanding debate on Wall Street about a bank’s responsibility to employees.

More than a decade ago Moritz Erhardt a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America in London died after working until 6 a.m. three nights in a row. A coroner concluded that Erhardt’s death from an epileptic seizure that limited his oxygen supply may have been triggered by fatigue.

Following his death banks made an effort to restrict employee work hours.

That discussion was reignited in 2021 after a PowerPoint presentation compiled by 13 Goldman Sachs junior bankers and calling out brutal workweeks leaked to the popular Wall Street influencer Litquidity.

“What is not ok to me is 110-120 hours over the course of a week! The math is simple that leaves 4 hours for eating sleeping showering bathroom and general transition time. This is beyond the level of ‘hard-working’ it is inhuman/ abuse” one analyst wrote at the time.

In response banks began hiring more staff to lighten junior employees’ workloads and limit hours.

But over the last year as Wall Street profits dropped and firms prepared for a possible recession several banks — including Bank of America — cut the workforce once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vZmFzaGlvbi1tZXQtZ2FsYS1jb3N0dW1lLWluc3RpdHV0ZS1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At the Met Sleeping Beauty Wakes Up in the Chemistry Lab,"When the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute announced its 2024 spring blockbuster show would be called “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” a lot of head-scratching ensued. Was this a show about Disney costumes? Princess frocks? Now the exhibition is actually here and the answer is: none of the above.

It’s a show built on a base of 15 pieces from the institute’s collection that have become so fragile over time they can no longer be displayed on mannequins (the “sleeping beauties”) along with more than 200 hardier gowns and accessories reflecting organic themes such as roses butterflies and beetles (nature also being fragile). Its curators seek to “reawaken” these items with a dash of technology and a soupçon of sensory overload: touch smell and sound. Imagine the ghostly rustling of silk taffeta the clinking of giant paillettes brought back to life by scientists and engineers. It’s not your usual fashion exhibit. But what exactly is it?

Vanessa Friedman chief fashion critic and Jason Farago critic at large debated the result. These are edited excerpts from their conversation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtYmFza2V0YmFsbC9uZXdzL2pvaG4tY2FsaXBhcmktaGl0cy1ncm91bmQtcnVubmluZy1pbi1hcmthbnNhcy1hZnRlci11Z2x5LWZpbmFsLWNoYXB0ZXItYXQta2VudHVja3ktdGhhdC1zdWNrcy_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwvbmV3cy9qb2huLWNhbGlwYXJpLWhpdHMtZ3JvdW5kLXJ1bm5pbmctaW4tYXJrYW5zYXMtYWZ0ZXItdWdseS1maW5hbC1jaGFwdGVyLWF0LWtlbnR1Y2t5LXRoYXQtc3Vja3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Calipari hits ground running in Arkansas after ugly final chapter at Kentucky that 'sucks',"FAYETTEVILLE Ark. — The new guy in town regrets the optics. A sterile corner office overlooking Arkansas' Bud Walton Arena is for now a muted tribute to what is about to take place.

""They've got this a little bit like a dentist's office so I apologize"" John Calipari says stepping out from behind an empty desk.

Things will soon be cluttered complicated and all-consuming for the Hogs' new basketball coach — just not today. Coach Cal has his first new job in 15 years. He must meet people reveal the personality that comes up on you like a three-quarter court press. Not all of those people are the much-scrutinized recruits who are populating that empty roster Calipari referred to in his introductory press conference.

Some of them are holy.

""We sleep pig and wake pig"" said Father Jason Sharbaugh who has already spotted Cal on campus at mass. ""It's all the more sweet having Coach in.""

Some of them are tolerated. For now the hall-of-fame coach is sharing a temporary condo with his son Brad near the center of the campus entertainment district Dickson Street.

""They said to me 'It may get a little loud. It's down by the strip' Calipari explained. ""I was there Monday Tuesday Wednesday. No problem. Friday? One place has live music the other has karaoke the other has a DJ.

""The whole room is like shaking from [the noise]. I'm sleeping with ear plugs.""

Some — well one — is a billionaire.

""One of the things Coach Cal does is he out-cares any coach in America"" said John Tyson chairman of Tyson Foods close friend and driving force behind Calipari taking the job. ""If you do it the right way the derivative of that is you might win the national championship.""

That's really what this is all about isn't it? Not just the possibility of a natty the actual documented proof of concept. Calipari has won one among his 855 career victories. His bona fides also include six Final Fours 12 Elite Eights and 15 Sweet 16s.

None of them lately of course but at age 65 Arkansas has become the next podium from which Cal can preach. Yes Calipari has reached retirement age but looks 55 and has more left in the tank than an Escalade. Never one to leave flair on the bench the coach's departure from Kentucky was as shocking as his arrival here was spectacular.

It was both the suddenness — and the destination — that astounded. Arkansas? Hogs everywhere love their hoops.

""I grew up on that action"" said Sharbaugh pastor of University of Arkansas Newman Center Parish. ""I just love the game. Next to Jesus it's the hottest thing in the universe.""

But it's also fair to point out Arkansas' place in the sporting universe. The Razorbacks last won 11 football games in 2011. A few months later coach Bobby Petrino crashed his motorcycle with a woman on board from the staff who was not his wife. Scandal ensued.

Nolan Richardson won Arkansas' last and only basketball championship in 1994. Eric Musselman contributed two Elite Eights in five seasons before leaving last month for … USC.

""You could see that coach Musselman had a desire — if maybe the right job opened up on the West Coast — to go home"" Tyson said.

It's additionally fair then to assert this is the biggest hire in the school's athletic history. Arkansas coaches have come from Kentucky (John Pelphrey played for the Wildcats) and gone to Kentucky (Eddie Sutton) but there has been nothing like this.

The likes of Frank Broyles Sutton and Richardson pretty much made their bones here. Lou Holtz won a conference title but bolted to Minnesota before finding the crest of his career at Notre Dame.

Legends all of them but Calipari comes prepackaged — oozing championship pedigree. He's got the blueprint stored in the synapses somewhere underneath that perfectly quaffed 'do. Just step aside and let him show you. It's expected actually.

""I made the analogy this like you have a worldwide company and it's in New York … and you're being encouraged by another area"" Calipari told CBS Sports. ""So you move the headquarters.""

From CBS Sports' Matt Norlander to Jay Bilas virtually all the game's tastemakers hailed Calipari's move as a multi-level win — for Cal for Arkansas for Kentucky — for college basketball.

All of them got a reset. Of course Cal's move can't be recounted without a reminder that a sizable amount of Big Blue Nation wanted him gone. To that well Calipari can't wait to respond.

""I think some people were happy"" the coach said of his departure from Kentucky. ""[Some were saying] 'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games.' [Actually 410] We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'""

The sarcasm might as well be dripping from the ceiling. Calipari then launched into slice-of-life memories from going back to Lexington Kentucky for a day before his exit. Folks were yelling ""We love you."" A couple pulled their car over to wish him well. At Panera ""one of the ladies came from the back in tears to hug me"" Cal said.

And now he is theirs again only here.

""I'm a poor miserable sinner"" Calipari said. ""Please That's who I am. I hope I have a good heart for kids and their families. I'm not a magician and I don't have a magic wand.""

If not he's got rights to the best set of card tricks ever seen.

Regardless Arkansas has proved it is all in. There is already talk of a monster NIL war chest. As of Tuesday the once-depleted Arkansas roster now includes seven scholarship players. Two Kentucky players have transferred to Arkansas — Adou Thiero and Zvonimor Ivišić. FAU transfer Johnell Davis one of the best talents in the portal led the Owls to the 2023 Final Four. Tennessee transfer Jonas Aidoo averaged 11 and 7 for the Vols. 247Sports currently has Calipari's first Arkansas class No. 6 nationally third in the SEC.

Think of what is at stake not only Arkansas' basketball future but Kentucky's basketball brand. What if the Hogs edge past the Wildcats on the national scene at some point with Calipari?

The transition has been swift and impressive. It was made clear by Cal there will be competition at Arkansas for a tight rotation. The Division I maximum is 13 scholarships per team. Who actually plays is another thing.

""I enjoyed coaching last year. I had a ball but that was hard"" Calipari said. ""Then Reed Sheppard decides to become [SEC] Freshman of the Year. I asked him after the season 'How much did you expect to play?' He said 'Ah I thought I'd be carrying water.' Did you expect to leave here after the season? He said 'Coach I expected to be here all four years.' ""

That's a roundabout way of Cal saying he still has it. Sheppard left for the NBA after a year and is projected as a top-10 NBA Draft pick.

""My thought was 'We're going to get this' and we had a good group coming in … "" Calipari continued. ""It wasn't like we were 15-15. But there's an expectation where it's only winning championships and winning that 'ship.

Arkansas fans couldnt wait to meet new basketball coach John Calipari. Getty Images

The Calipari rollout came on a recent rainy Wednesday night at Bud Walton. Calipari looked out of place at his introductory press conference. Watching him wear red Arkansas gear was like watching Derek Jeter in a Padres uniform instead of pinstripes. Some things just need getting used to. This was life-changing in a basketball sense. Ted Owens the 94-year-old former Kansas coach who gave Calipari his first job signaled that by making the trip over from Tulsa Oklahoma.

The only thing missing was Cal's first public calling of the hogs. That's coming too and will be a major event in these parts.

""It gave [fans] a chance to really thump their chests and say 'Hey we got a blue blood's head coach to come to our university and coach our men's basketball team'"" Arkansas AD Hunter Yurachek said.

An athletic department whose budget was 10th among 14 SEC teams last year has a modern superstar on the bench. A state of only 3 million people is hungry to rally around a gregarious legend from Moon Township Pennsylvania who was once fired by the New Jersey Nets.

""I'm not going to try to get spiritual"" Calipari said. Then of course he did.

""Something nudges you and you don't know what it is"" the coach continued. ""But I've been there [at Kentucky] 15 years. Maybe it's 'You've done what I needed you to do there for the kids for the state. Now I need you to do something down there [at Arkansas].' ""

The earth-bound driving force behind the hire certainly doesn't want to be considered the driving force behind the hire. Tyson 70 is certainly the basketball patriarch of this endeavor. Yes he is the money man of many things in Arkansas. This one happens to be personal.

This is Tyson's second run at Calipari. While Calipari was at Memphis in 2007 Tyson and Broyles reached out. Calipari couldn't make himself leave his players — especially Derrick Rose — back then. Memphis then played for a national championship in 2008.

""I think we were close [to getting him] but that's when Cal said 'I'm committed to my kids' Tyson said. ""Back then kids couldn't move. Nowadays kids can move.""

Which kind of explains the game the climate and the reason for the move.

Neither Calipari nor Tyson can remember the circumstances of their first meeting two decades ago. They bonded over talk of leadership. Tyson oversees a global food company headquartered in Springdale Arkansas that is second nationally in the processing of chicken beef and pork. He reminisces lovingly about his late father Don who admired Harry Truman so much his office is built in an oval shape for two reasons.

That imitates both Truman's Oval Office and the shape of eggs laid by chickens that are so important to the company.

Calipari specializes in shaping 18-year-olds into champions for the one of the biggest brands in college basketball. His players have signed NBA contracts worth more than $4 billion.

That should be relatable to any CEO — or recruit. When Kentucky came to town Calipari would go out of his way to have Tyson at his courtside seat. Never mind Tyson being a huge Arkansas benefactor.

""He's my friend first"" he said of Calipari.

They call each other youthful nicknames of endearment — Johnny. That's why when Tyson said it's fair to say things had gotten stale between the two parties at Kentucky it means something.

""I talk to my folks around here. There are cycles"" Tyson said. 'Don't tell me you're going to retire at 65. There are business cycles. When we get to the end of the cycle do you want to sign up for another cycle?' ""

You don't have to be dunked on to get the connection. Cal has signed up for another cycle at Arkansas. And stale has different definitions. Calipari once consulted former Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall who lasted 13 years in the Big Blue maelstrom.

""I stayed three years too many"" Calipari quoted Hall as telling him.

Cal stayed at Kentucky two years beyond that. At the end of last season Tyson estimated there were three options for his friend – stay with the Wildcats chase a championship elsewhere or go do TV.

""But he's a competitor"" Tyson said.

""Last year revived me. I had so much fun with those kids and they celebrated each other"" Calipari said. ""The way it ended … I'll just say sucks.""

The first-round loss to Oakland marked the third straight year UK finished short of the Sweet 16. The last time that happened was 2006-2008 under Tubby Smith and Billy Gillespie.

The Arkansas' hiring process took less than three days. On April 4 Yurachek was in Phoenix for the Final Four. About 1 pm PT Musselman informed the AD he was taking the USC job.

Tyson first called his coaching friend to ask if he'd speak to Yurachek about vetting candidates. Yurachek called Calipari that night.

At some point Yurachek cut to the chase and asked Calipari if he was interested.

""In my judgment as a businessman either you go big [or not]"" Tyson said. ""When we were talking big I threw out three names. I said 'Do you call Bill Self? Do you call Danny Hurley or do you call Coach Cal?

'Or do you [hire] Chris Beard Jerome Tang. In the business world you call that a lateral move. You go get somebody who knows how to do the business. You're probably going to have to pay them a little more.""

It wasn't until Yurachek and Calipari talked that they found out they were in the same city for unrelated reasons. Cal was in Phoenix for an NABC meeting. (He is the current president of the coaches' organization.) Yurachek was also there for a meeting as a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee.

Calipari said any face-to-face meeting would have to happen quickly.

Tyson then told Yurachek he'd better have a plan. That is aligning the support and resources of the university to make such a hire. In other words John Calipari doesn't have to interview for the job. He just has to want it.

""Swing big … who would you hire?"" Tyson emphasized. ""Coach Cal of course.""

The two sides connected. Calipari vetted Yurachek with Houston coach Kelvin Sampson who had worked under Yurachek the former Cougars' AD.

Cal didn't want the news to leak that he had been talking to Arkansas stealing the spotlight from the Final Four. Then of course it leaked.

""I'm not mad about it"" Calipari said ""but it wasn't me and then it was like an avalanche.""

Speculation and anticipation ran wild. By that Saturday night an oral agreement was close. Only a tight circle knew – Yurachek Calipari Cal's lawyer Tom Mars and an Arkansas board member. That in itself was unique. Yurachek had once been named in a lawsuit filed by Mars who was representing former football coach Bret Bielema against the Arkansas Razorback Foundation.

""Hunter was a real pro. He was hands-on. I guess he forgave me for all the horrible things I said about him in the Bielema lawsuit"" Mars joked.

Attorney Matt McCoy who oversees athletic department legal affairs was looped in.

""We just kept at it and got the contract finished Monday night"" said a source involved in the talks. ""A land-speed record.""

It helped that Cal didn't have an agent a rarity for someone of his stature. An agent would have taken approximately $1.225 million of the $35 million Calipari is earning over those five years in fees. An agent would have possibly extended the negotiations by weeks.

Arkansas was indeed all in. The basketball world — no American sports — gasped. Dickson Street had a new inhabitant.

In the middle of the interview in that sterile office a familiar face ducked in the doorway.

""You good?"" he said.

It was not some assistant doing a preplanned drop by to make sure the interview didn't run too long. This was Brad Calipari that 27-year-old coaches' son and roommate who has moved over from the staff at Vanderbilt.

John Calipari indeed was good. For now.

""His mom is telling him to check on me every 30 minutes to see if I'm still alive"" the coach said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbXN1bWF2ZXJpY2tzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvNS85L3dvbWVucy10cmFjay1hbmQtZmllbGQtbGF1dnN0YWQtbGVhZHMtbXN1LWhlcHRhdGhsb24tYXQtbnNpYy1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXBzLmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lauvstad leads MSU Heptathlon at NSIC Championships - Minnesota State University,"Thanks for visiting !

On the other hand we have generative design in Fusion 360 software—the technology that revolutionizes the engineering world and the ways we design things. Autodesk development teams have been working on capitalizing on these proven simulation solvers as well as the latest technologies in generative design. As a result a new tech preview feature named Experimental Solver is enabled in Fusion 360.

This means every user of the generative design feature will also see new outcomes with new sophisticated shapes in addition to the existing traditional solutions. This technology brings new functionalities and delivers forms optimized in a new way opening doors that have been closed previously. In addition to showing how to use the new technology of generative design in Fusion 360 above all we will present how the new functionalities empower the new applications using real-world examples.

Related: Fusion 360 Introduction to Generative Design with Robert Savage

What Are Experimental Solvers in Generative Design?

Experimental Generative Solvers and Features is a preview feature available in Fusion 360. This is a technology which combines all abilities of generative design (advanced optimization algorithms manufacturing constraints design permutations) supported by new features (enforcing symmetry in outcomes voids insertion in shapes) with mature reliable simulation tools (advanced physics buckling analysis displacements limitation frequency constraints removing rigid modes). Additionally Experimental Solvers and Features improves the robustness and performance of generative design solutions.

How to Use New Experimental Solvers in Fusion 360

The Experimental Solvers feature is a part of generative design which is available to every Fusion 360 user. To open the Generative Design Workspace inside Fusion 360 you need to navigate to the Generative Design option (2) inside the workspace selector (1) in the upper left corner of the Fusion 360 window.

As the Experimental Solvers feature is still being developed and improved it is available as a preview feature. This means that to use it you will need to enable it in the Preferences dialog box of Fusion 360. To do this first open the Preferences window by choosing the Preferences option (4) inside the menu (3) in the upper right corner of the Fusion 360 window.

Inside the Preferences window find the Preview Features option (5) and then make sure that under the Generative Design tab you have selected Experimental Generative Solvers and Features (6).

The above steps will enable the Experimental Solvers Tech Preview for your account. Now to explore alternative outcomes for a specific study one more step is needed. After creating a new study open its Study Settings (78) and select the Alternative Outcomes option (9).

When you run the study with the Alternative Outcomes option selected you will be able to use new features that are described in more detail later and you may get some additional outcomes on top of the default ones.

If you are a new user of generative design and have no knowledge of how to create or run a generative design study reference Fusion 360 Introduction to Generative Design.

Alternative Outcomes

Thanks to the continuous work on design divergence new Experimental Solvers offer up to four additional outcomes plus the default ones for every study setup. The final number of outcomes may vary depending on the chosen study configuration; that is manufacturing constraints additional constraints like symmetry etc.

Please note that Experimental Solvers is still a preview feature which means that some of the new features may not be working with all manufacturing constraints and final outcomes count might be smaller. Some of the configurations are not possible to run at all. The full list of supported manufacturing methods is presented later next to the description of every new constraint.

After opening the results in the Explore tab you can identify the outcomes that were generated by Experimental Solvers by the flask icon in the upper right corner of the outcome thumbnail.

Capabilities: New Design Variants

One of the characteristics of the new Experimental Solvers is increased variety of shapes. Thanks to new ways of optimization the results you get for the same study setup can differ significantly in terms of the form while continuing to meet the optimization objectives. This gives you the freedom to choose the design based on its aesthetic values and not only mechanical properties.

Below are presented some examples that show this behavior. Both design variants have remarkably similar parameters like a minimum factor of safety or mass but are completely different visually.

Capabilities: Shapes with Voids

Another interesting feature of Experimental Solvers is its ability to create void shapes. In the standard approach of the generative design solver the material can only be removed from the outer surface of the model. In most cases this method provides satisfactory results; however there are some situations where it is insufficient and the outcomes that it produces are not the optimal ones.

The improved algorithms of Experimental Solvers provide the possibility to remove the material also from the inside if it makes sense for a given model. This allows for faster optimization in some of the cases and produces the shapes that are more optimal from an engineering point of view.

Let’s look at the example. The picture below shows the beam being subjected to a torque load. The green parts are preserve geometries while the yellow part is a starting shape.

When you run the static stress analysis on this model (in the Simulation workspace inside Fusion 360 for example) you will see that maximum stresses are located on the outer surface of the model while the inside of the model is subjected to much lower stress values.





The most logical and most optimal solution here would be the shape that has its outer edges preserved and is empty inside. However up until now the generative design solver was unable to produce such a shape. The Experimental Solver brings new possibilities and you can see the results in the image below. At the top of the image is the design produced by the standard generative design solver. At the bottom there is an outcome created by a new optimization method used in Experimental Solver. The second design is much closer to the one that is indicated by stresses distribution inside of the model. It is also much lighter and has a much lower displacement value than the traditional design.

Capabilities: Displacements Limitation

Displacements

Displacements are directional motions of the structure under applied loads. Apart from the load-bearing capacity requirements many design standards also limit the maximum allowable displacements.

In the traditional generative design approach we can see the maximum displacement of the generated outcome but we are unable to directly impact it before the post-processing stage.

The example of a considered generative design outcome. Parameters of the generated outcome. Simulation results on the outcome for displacements.

With Experimental Solvers and Features we can gain more control by constraining allowable displacements. As the preview option is turned on the additional options appear in Objectives and Limits.

Global Displacements

The first constraint is related to global displacements which are total motions of nodes in a model considered in a global coordinate system.

Model Setup

1. On the Define tab click Design Criteria > Objectives

2. Click Displacement and select Global

3. Choose from one up to three directions

4. Specify the maximum displacement value for X Y and/or Z directions





Setup for constraining global displacements.

To limit global displacements in the considered model we set the allowable maximum value 0.1 mm in all three orthogonal directions.

Then we compare two final outcomes: without displacement constraints and with global constraints. As the result we can see that the final outcomes have shape optimized in a similar way. For the one with limited displacements there are fewer but more stocky members.

Comparing these properties we can see that the Factor of Safety for both is the same. However maximum global displacement was reduced from 0.28 mm to 0.1 mm as it was constrained.

The outcome without displacement constraints.

The Red Raiders’ senior standout was voted a 2021 East-West all-star by members of the North Carolina Coaches Association (NCCA). He is the one in 20 of the state’s top seniors selected to the game and first in the history of South Point boys hoops history.

“It’s really an honor” he said. “Not much was expected of us as a team and I’m glad we were able to do some good things and have a winning record my senior year. It was really fun playing with this group of guys.”

Following the transfer of 2019-20 Southwestern 2A Player of the Year Logan Threatt one wondered where South Point would get its offense this past basketball season. Baker did more than his part to fill the void scoring 23.2 points per game along with 3.9 rebounds.

“We kind of took that personally” said Baker who shot 60% from the field during an abbreviated 2021 basketball campaign. “Before the season we talked as a team about playing for each other. I knew there was the possibility of a season like this from me and the team so it was great to see that hard work and togetherness show up on the basketball court.”

Like his former teammate Baker was voted conference player of the year the second straight South Point boys hoops standout to earn the award. He'd also earn all-District 10 honors by the state Basketball Coaches Association (NCBCA) helping the Red Raiders finished 10-4 during the 2021 winter hoops session.

With very little recruiting interest at the start of his senior season Baker’s work earned him a spot on the North Greenville (South Carolina) University basketball roster. He signed a National Letter of Intent to attend the school earlier this month.

A couple significant accomplishments in his back pocket there is one the South Point boys basketball standout wishes he could add to the list.

“It would have been great to reach 1000 points” said Baker who finished with 885 points after three years at the varsity level. “In a regular season I probably would have got it. But to have the season I did I don’t really have any regrets. It was a blessing to play at all this year.”

Media reports suggest as many as 400000 bpd of Venezuelan oil could be orphaned as new Chinese tax laws make it impossible for the country to export its crude to Asia. New regulations expected to come into place on June 12 would make the profit margins on Venezuelan oil too low to warrant its current export route.

Venezuela has not been exporting oil directly to China since 2019 largely due to the U.S. sanctions that continue to restrict the country’s oil exportation. However China has been importing Venezuelan oil via Malaysian refineries where it is mixed with fuel oil or bitumen before continuing on to China. China’s new rules could add around $30 per barrel to this ""diluted bitumen"" making it economically inviable. Light cycle oil (LCO) and mixed aromatics will also be taxed under the new scheme.

Chinese customs data suggests that around 380000 bpd of diluted bitumen were coming into the country via Malaysia between January and March much of which originated in Venezuela.

While non-U.S. companies are not explicitly prevented by the sanctions from buying Venezuelan oil it has been highly discouraged. However due to China’s growing oil demand many of these alternative routes of access have been largely overlooked by the U.S.

The Chinese Ministry of Finance stated of the background for the new tax introduction ""A small number of companies have imported record amounts of these fuels and processed them into sub-quality fuels which were then funneled into illicit distribution channels threatening fair market play and also causing pollution"".

New taxes are expected to pave way for opportunities for China’s domestic refiners to increase supply as well as boosting prices as the country’s fuel demand continues to increase. This comes as Chinese oil refiners hit higher production levels in April signaling a sustained recovery in crude processing.

While Venezuela is facing huge changes in its export outlook due to Chinese taxes it seems as if the U.S. will continue to waive sanctions for several international companies based in Venezuela allowing several firms to continue existing in the country within limits.

Previously permitted waivers are expected to continue for oil major Chevron and services companies Schlumberger Halliburton Baker Hughes and Weatherford. This will allow the firms to preserve their assets so long as they don’t carry out maintenance activities or pay local employees.

The waivers are expected to be renewed for at least six months in June after which it could be possible for Chevron to lift Venezuelan oil as stated in an early waiver. However for now Venezuela does not seem to be a key foreign policy focus for Biden making this possible but unlikely.

It seems as though Venezuela is trapped in somewhat of a stalemate unable to progress with U.S. allies due to heavy sanctions on its oil sector and unable to export to major importer China due to heavy taxes. While there is the potential for wiggle room in the coming year as Biden creates a clearer foreign policy strategy the future is still unknown for the untapped potential of the Latin American oil giant.

Not conscious thought anyway. In those moments when he has the ball at his feet and the goal in his sights even after all these years even when he can lay claim to being the most complete most ruthless most polished striker of his generation he is not thinking.

Or more to the point: He is not aware of himself thinking. He is not weighing options rifling through possibilities selecting the best of them. Thinking takes time and there is no time. “There is not even half a second to think about what to do or how to do it” he said.

And yet he is thinking. Or more to the point: He is learning. He is absorbing information analyzing it filing it away.

There was a moment in his game for Bayern Munich against Borussia Dortmund in March when the ball fell to Lewandowski on the edge of the penalty area. He took a touch and a shot. It was not by his own admission “perfect.” His effort flew over the crossbar. Lewandowski turned away in disappointment ruing an opportunity wasted.",,,,,,,,,

To get it in your inbox sign up for free here.

CNN —

There are countervailing storylines that complicate the pandemic recovery. Millions of Americans remain unemployed while companies big and small are reporting extreme difficulty in finding workers.

That’s prompted a push by Republican governors – 22 so far – to reject the $300-per-week unemployment benefits that were included in the Democrats’ Covid relief bill this past March.

The pandemic benefits run out in September anyway so these states are turning down money the federal government has already approved cutting off money earmarked for more nearly 2 million out-of-work Americans.

The idea is that with the economy reopening thanks to the vaccines the boosted checks might be keeping workers on the sidelines – and taking them away will essentially force them back into the job market. That would help smaller businesses that are not as well equipped as larger companies to draw workers with higher pay or other perks.

There’s something of a Rorschach test here. You can look at the plight of business owners and think the government should cut support that’s making it hard for them to hire. Or you can look at a person whose wages are normally low enough that $300 per week is enough to keep them out of the labor force and think maybe businesses should raise pay.

I went to Anneken Tappe the senior writer at CNN Business who covers the US economy to get her thoughts on the labor shortage and what’s behind it. Our conversation was conducted by email.

Is there a labor shortage?

WHAT MATTERS: Republican governors are rejecting expanded federal unemployment benefits for their citizens because they say there is a labor shortage; restaurants can’t open goes the storyline because workers would rather collect unemployment and not work. What’s really happening?

TAPPE: America’s labor market is in a weird spot. On the one hand some employers just can’t find workers to stem rising demand for goods and services. Meanwhile millions of people remain unemployed or out of the labor market (which means they aren’t actively looking for work). As of April America was still down 8.2 million jobs compared to February 2020.

So what gives?

Millions of American workers still need the enhanced unemployment assistance which provides an additional $300 per week. It is earmarked to end in September. Research from Bank of America recently found that the pandemic-era benefits indeed do keep people from looking for work – but only if people made less than $32000 per year before which is less than half the national median income. For these low-income workers it makes sense not to work but to collect benefits while for higher-income earners it doesn’t.

But income might only be one part of the puzzle. Workers still have to weigh health risks and care obligations against a return to work.

Who is having trouble finding workers?

WHAT MATTERS: Which industries are hardest hit? And how is that affecting the re-opening?

TAPPE: One industry that is particularly affected by a shortage of qualified personnel is manufacturing. Potential employees are concerned those jobs could be outsourced or replaced by machines.

As for the claim that restaurants can’t open because workers would rather stay home the data isn’t really showing that. In April the hospitality sector added 331000 jobs half of which were in restaurants and bars. No other sector even came close to adding that many jobs. Still the sector is still down 2.8 million jobs compared to pre-pandemic times so economists expect more jobs to be added over the coming months.

Why don’t companies raise wages?

WHAT MATTERS: The counter-argument is that workers in less desirable jobs are underpaid. I’m no economist but couldn’t companies just pay workers a higher wage to bring them into the work force?

TAPPE: That’s actually already happening. The reopening has spurred demand from consumers and many companies have a hard time keeping up with demand so they’re raising wages to attract workers. Under Armour Wednesday announced it will bump its US minimum wage from $10 to $15 an hour to compete in this confusing labor market which means a pay rise for 90% of the company’s store and warehouse staff.

Amazon Walmart Costco McDonald’s Chipotle and others have also increased certain wages.

Bank of America went a step further Tuesday and announced it would lift its minimum wage from $20 to $25 per hour.

Is a lack of access to child care – including camp and in-person school – keeping women out of the work force right now?

WHAT MATTERS: You’ve written about how lack of child care during Covid and start-stop returns to public schools has affected both companies who want to bring workers back and workers who can’t figure out where to put their kids. Is that a large enough issue to affect the labor market?

TAPPE: It’s hard to tell right now. One challenge with the pandemic-era labor market is that it’s evolving very quickly but while we might see rapid improvements on one end problems persist elsewhere.

We know that last September when school started again after the summer break hundreds of thousands of women dropped out of the labor force (meaning they are not looking to return to work) because of child care obligations at home. Now that offices are reopening again but daycares and schools are not fully back up and running again this is creating a similar problem for some parents.

The jobs recovery is chugging along anyway though we’re still far from back to normal. Time will tell how the child care problem in this time affected parents and particularly mothers in the workforce.

Inflation is making everything more expensive

WHAT MATTERS: The other economic issue we’re hearing a lot about is inflation. Everything is getting more expensive. That’s worrying given how many people are still unemployed right?

TAPPE: Inflation is rising because Americans are spending more money again. In principle that’s a really good thing because the US economy runs on consumer spending so every dollar counts. The Federal Reserve as well as economists predict that prices will keep rising this summer as the economy fully reopens and people spend on things like traveling again before they eventually normalize. One worry is that prices will rise so fast that they discourage people from spending. That would be really bad news for the recovery but so far there is little indication of that happening.

That said it is true that higher prices are just the latest effect from the pandemic that is hitting lower-income workers harder than others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L2Jpei8yMDI0LzA1LzYwMl8zMDkyNTkuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTMwOTI1OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BofA Securities wins trust from Korean internet-only banks,"Seen is a Bank of America branch in New York in May 2009. Reuters-Yonhap



By Park Jae-hyuk



BofA Securities the investment banking division of Bank of America has come under the spotlight in the domestic capital market after it was selected as the underwriter to attract investments for internet-only banks here.



According to industry sources and media reports Sunday the U.S. investment bank is in charge of convincing global investors including private equity firms (PEFs) to invest a combined $100 million in Viva Republica the Toss mobile money transfer app operator which will open the nation's third digital bank Toss Bank during the second half of this year.



Viva Republica is said to have changed the underwriter of the deal recently from JPMorgan which had advised the fintech firm on its acquisition of LG Uplus' payment gateway business last year.



The fundraising seems to be intended to enhance the services of Viva Republica's wholly-owned subsidiary Toss Securities and for the initial public offering (IPO) of the parent firm which is likely to take place next year at the earliest.



Viva Republica's ties with BofA became known after the latter reportedly enabled K bank Korea's first internet-only bank to raise 1.2 trillion won ($1 billion) from its current shareholders and major PEFs such as MBK Partners and Bain Capital ahead of its planned IPO in 2023.



As a result all eyes are on whether the U.S. firm will succeed in attracting investments for Viva Republica and whether it will expand its presence in the local IPO market by continuing to cooperate with the two internet-only banks.



Although BofA displayed a successful track record in the M&A advisory sector last year by pulling off multiple large-scale deals ― the sale of Intel's NAND business to SK hynix the sale of Takeda Pharmaceutical's Asia-Pacific business to Celltrion and the sale of D'Live's iHQ to KH Electron ― it had remained off the radar of the local IPO market for seven years until being selected as a co-underwriter for LG Energy Solution's IPO earlier this year.

But in America’s moment of racial reckoning critics ask is it right?

Example video title will go here for this video

Example video title will go here for this video

Payday lenders and other businesses that offer high-cost small-dollar loans say they serve customers that big traditional banks ignore.

But a WFAA investigation discovered the money that finances many predatory lenders comes from the very same big banks.

It’s a part of a larger pattern of economic injustice for low-income communities of color south of Interstate 30 which is a dividing line in Dallas and the subject of the ongoing WFAA investigative series “Banking Below 30.”

Predatory Lending

The term predatory lending is defined by government regulators as businesses that among other things fail to fully disclose or explain the true costs and risk of loans; have “risky loan terms and structures” that “make it more difficult or impossible for borrowers to reduce their indebtedness” and that charge “customers unearned concealed or unwarranted fees.”

Texas’ Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner regulates the payday auto title installment and pawn lending businesses to ensure each “provides compliant financial products” but those businesses under Texas law are still allowed to charge interest rates and fees far in excess of what a traditional banks would charge.

Leon Cox said he regrets going to a payday lender when he was short on cash.

“I was working from temp agency to temp agency and there were a couple times I just couldn’t make rent” he said. “With a payday loan it’s never worth it. You'll take out $500 and end up paying maybe $1500 back.”

High-cost lending is a popular business below I-30. Records show there are 88 storefront locations in southern Dallas.

According to the advocacy group Texas Appleseed in 2019 payday and auto title lenders charged Texans more than $2 billion in fees. While Blacks and Latinos make up 45% of all Texas households they make up 71% of auto title customers and 74% of payday loan customers according to an analysis of FDIC data by Texas Appleseed.

Cox said these types of lenders “keep you down.""

""It's the old cliché – the rich get richer and poor get poorer” he explained.

Our review of public records filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reveals that almost 20 banks are funding or have recently funded predatory lenders. Some are big banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Other are based in Texas like Texas Capital Bank of Texas Veritex Bank TBK Bank Amegy Bank and Independent Bank.

We reached out to several industry groups representing high-cost small-dollar lenders. They say their fees are reasonable given the credit histories of their customers and that they are helping people get loans that banks have abandoned.

""Nearly half of Americans cannot afford a $400 unanticipated expense"" the Community Financial Services Association of America says on their website. ""By providing loans to those who cannot otherwise access traditional forms of credit small-dollar lenders help communities and small businesses thrive and allow money to be reinvested in local businesses and neighborhoods where it is needed most.""

“It's for economic exploitation” said the Rev. Frederick Haynes III pastor of Friendship-West Baptist Church in southern Dallas and vocal critic of high-cost lenders. In April he testified against them in a U.S. Senate hearing.

“It's a horrific cycle” he told WFAA. “It's a system that is designed to ensure that some thrive at the expense of others.”

Lenders to FirstCash

FirstCash based in Fort Worth operates 2770 pawn stores. Under Texas law a pawn dealer can charge up 240% interest on a loan. A review of records filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows Wells Fargo Texas Capital Bank and Bank of Texas are all creditors to FirstCash.

Data that Wells Fargo shares with the federal government that was analyzed by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition show the bank makes relatively few loans to low- to moderate-income borrowers in Dallas County. Their analysis shows that Wells Fargo made 18% of its home purchase loans to low- to moderate- income borrowers which is third from the bottom among banks in the county.

But Wells Fargo shares in a $400 million line of credit to FirstCash along with Bank of Texas Texas Capital Bank Amegy Bank Prosperity Bank First Tennessee Bank Independent Bank Southside and BBVA Bank according to SEC filings in 2016 and 2020.

We asked these banks why they choose to finance a high-cost lender. Bank of Texas Texas Capital First Tennessee and BBVA had no comment. Prosperity Independent and Southside didn’t respond to questions.

Amegy sent us a response.

“With regard to why Amegy would provide a loan to FirstCash we are active in making loans and providing banking services to businesses that operate within the law – including local state and federal – and who fit within our risk appetite” Amegy spokesperson Stefani Smith wrote. “We leave the decisions as to which businesses should be allowed to legally operate to elected officials and the enforcement of such laws to the appropriate authorities.”

So did Wells Fargo.

“Wells Fargo provides credit and services to companies in a variety of financial services industries” spokesperson Camille Brewer wrote. “We have relationships with companies that have demonstrated a strong ongoing commitment and capability to comply with applicable laws and regulations to their business operations.”

Ann Baddour with Texas Appleseed a nonprofit advocating for fair lending practices for low-income and minority communities said she’s not surprised to see Wells Fargo leading credit agreements for these high-cost lenders.

“Wells Fargo has a long history of being a creditor for payday and auto title lenders” Baddour said. “It's objectionable to me personally but it's legal. I can't tell them to not do it. But it's about values and building communities.”

FirstCash also sent us a response. The company provides “quick and convenient locations to buy value-priced merchandise and obtain small short-term collateralized pawn loans which customers are not obligated to repay” Chief Financial Officer R. Douglas Orr said in a statement.

“Pawn loans do not involve credit checks negative credit reporting or collections activities even if the customer does not repay or redeem the loan” Orr added. “All of the company’s pawn operations are fully licensed regulated and operated in accordance with all federal state and local laws.”

Lenders to Enova

Another high-cost lender is Enova which offers among other products payday loans online. In disclosures to the state of Texas Enova documents annual loan rates of 409% to 664%.

And who helps finance Enova's operations? In part Veritex Bank and TBK Bank – both based in Dallas. TBK has a $35 million credit agreement with Enova and Veritex $20 million according to this SEC filing.

We asked these banks why they choose to finance a high-cost lender. Veritex Bank had no comment. TBK Bank responded that “…we follow well-known policies applicable to all banks to ensure that our customers’ business activities comply with the law.”

In a statement Enova says its “…online services reach people and businesses all over the U.S. including places where banks no longer have branches…”

Lenders to World Finance

World Finance is another high-cost lender. At its 1200 storefront offices the company offers installment loans which under Texas law carry 80% to 113% interest plus fees and charges.

According to this 2015 SEC filing World Finance’s operations are financed in part by Wells Fargo with a commitment as high as $200 million and Texas Capital loaning up to $30 million.

This March 2020 filing with the SEC shows several other lenders to World Finance including Bank of Montreal First Tennessee Bank BankUnited Axos Bank and Pacific Western Bank.

Bank of Montreal BankUnited Axos and Pacific Western did not respond to questions. First Tennessee as before had no comment.

Lenders to Curo

In this SEC filing Curo discloses a $50 million credit agreement with several institutions such as BayCoast Bank Stride Bank Hancock-Whitney Bank Metropolitan Commercial Bank and a $10 million agreement with Royal Bank of Canada.

We reached out to all these banks about why they lend money to Curo.

Hancock-Whitney and Royal Bank of Canada had no comment.

Stride and Metropolitan Commercial did not respond.

In a statement BayCoast said it is the “lead bank on a revolving corporate credit facility” for Curo which “accesses this credit facility periodically for liquidity purposes and does not use the credit facility to fund consumer loans.”

“We evaluate all of our relationships regularly to ensure that our vendors maintain our high standards of operation” said James Wallace BayCoast chief operating officer.

Long history

Baddour said the rise of high-cost small-dollar lending targeting low-income people has a long history.

“In many ways we wouldn't even be having these conversations about payday loans if financial institutions so long ago didn't abandon these communities” Baddour said.

She's saying predatory lending echoes back to an older problem called redlining where banks refuse to lend in minority neighborhoods.

The Community Reinvestment Act is a law meant to repair that damage. It says banks are required to meet the credit needs of the minority community and reinvest in neighborhoods they've long ignored. But Pastor Haynes says when banks finance predatory lenders they violate the spirit of the law.

“I think it’s time for banking regulators to step up and say ‘We’re serious about this issue and we want to ensure that justice in banking is a norm’” Pastor Haynes said. “It's not just time. It's past time.”

One of those regulators is the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which oversees the biggest banks in the country.

“We do not comment on individual bank matters” said OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard in response to WFAA's questions.

But he pointed out that banks extending credit or loaning money to high-cost lenders doesn’t mean they are playing any role in those businesses' lending decisions.

“It is important to note that such nonbank lenders and companies are state-licensed and regulated” Hubbard added. “The OCC does not review and approve bank customers and generally does not determine what company or customer a bank may serve.”

Change in Policy

Some banks have begun to change their policies on financing predatory lenders. Capital One says it will not finance payday and auto title lenders. Chase Bank has stopped lending to them too. Key Bank in Ohio also stopped.

Bank of America had been a long-time lender to World Finance with a line of credit up to $150 million. However the bank says it terminated that relationship in 2020.

Bank of America now also offers a new product called Balance Assist. For a $5 fee existing customers can borrow up to $500 for terms that are far better than a payday lender – an industry Bank of America now says runs ""contrary to our values.”

“It's encouraging to me to see such a large financial institution take to heart all the feedback that has been around for a long time about the financial services needs of communities and really start to do something about it” Baddour said. “I deeply believe that that is the pathway forward.”

Banks that finance predatory lenders defend themselves by saying the practice is legal. But Pastor Haynes says in America's moment of racial reckoning these banks should be asking themselves “Is this right?”

“It creates a permanent underclass – permanent ghettos” he said. “And it's being financed by banking institutions. There's something diabolical and wrong with that picture.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1jb21wYW5pZXMtbW9zdC1jYXNoLXJlc2VydmVzLTE4MjcwODIxMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Companies With The Most Cash Reserves In America,"In this article we are going to list the 15 companies with the most cash reserves in America. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Companies With The Most Cash Reserves In America.

The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the economy in a way that no one thought possible. Back when the economy of the United States crashed in 2008 - 2009 and the rest of the world followed suit few people thought they would face an even worse disaster in 202o just over a decade later. But that is what happened in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic which originated in China spread across the world leading to over 170 million cases as well more than 3.5 million deaths. These figures themselves are likely to be extremely understated and we will know the true impact of Covid-19 in the coming years.

As countries started imposing lockdowns to battle this virus for which they had no solution economies which are entirely dependent on lockdowns well not happening. Most industries faced significant losses as economies collapsed and most countries across the globe entered into either recessions or depressions. Many companies had to incur massive losses as well as major layoffs as demand for most industries fell and going at the same rate as pre-pandemic made no sense at all.

Even though as I mentioned most industries and companies suffered some actually came out of the pandemic smelling like roses. Take Tesla for example. The market cap of the company jumped astronomically during 2020 making even ordinary shareholders into millionaires and making Elon Musk the richest man in the world and the highest earning billionaire in 2020 as well as the richest man in the world for a while. Tech companies generally managed quite well in fact with many companies reporting higher sales and profits as demand for tech increased while more and more people continued to work from home.

Another example is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America. Apple Inc has nearly $200 billion in cash and marketable securities. One would think that with a large number of its stores closed Apple would have suffered dearly during the crisis. Fortunately for Apple Inc. (AAPL) shareholders the company did well during the past 12 months and AAPL shares performed even better. The company used some of its cash hoard to continue paying dividends and buy back shares. Apple Inc. should have used its massive cash hoard to snatch some EV and battery companies on the cheap.

15 companies with the most cash reserves in America

Another technology stock that is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America is Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook Inc carries more than $60 billion in cash on its books and despite this huge buffer Facebook shares declined all the way down to $140 in March 2020. Mr. Market misjudged Facebook's potential for a few days but investors had a change of heart after a few weeks and Facebook shares returned more than 120% since its March 2020 lows. Unfortunately Facebook Inc's management didn't put its huge cash hoard into good use and take advantage of the opportunities.

Most of the companies that made our list of the 15 companies with the highest cash reserves in America are tech companies but you can also find non-technology stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Ford (NYSE:F) on our list. Costco was one of the beneficiaries of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic but JP Morgan Chase and Ford shares suffered large losses despite their cash reserves.

It would make sense that tech companies have massive cash reserves. Due to the high value of shares of these companies as well as the fact that their products are generally highly priced with significant margins these companies tend to have a lot of surplus cash on hand. However having a lot of excess cash can also be often considered to be a failure on the part of the company to have the cash simply lying around when it could be put to better use say on investing activities or to pay off debts which would allow the company to save significant money on interest payments. On the other hand having too little cash can give the signal that the company has liquidity issues and can also be perceived negatively by investors and shareholders. Therefore there is a fine balance to maintain one which many companies are able to maintain while others are not.

However in the era of Covid where the economy needs significant boosts it is frustrating many people including Wall Street that companies are sitting on massive piles of cash and yet are refusing to utilize it. As I mentioned earlier companies can use it for investing activities as well as acquisitions or by returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends which would gain them goodwill in an unprecedented year. Another option is buyback of shares from shareholders though detractors argue that this is simply a short term boost for investors while resulting in a long term effect on the health of a company.

Of course the simple reason would be that this isn't the best time really to spend money. The market is uncertain the economy will take a while to recover and while there is optimism on the horizon with vaccines being administered it is still a long haul process and not an immediate one. Hence companies are a bit cautious in investing money. Further the biggest companies in the world are also really big on acquisitions with Apple acquiring a hundred companies over the last 6 months. That means an acquisition every three to four weeks. Furthermore tech companies famous for having a lot of cash on hand are also known for sitting on said cash. And even though this doesn't mean that these companies are not spending cash at all it's just that many analysts believe that these companies are not doing as much as they do.

Coming up with the list of companies with the largest cash reserves in America was not an easy task. Search on the internet and you'll generally find tech companies and even then those articles are often outdated. Most people want to know the reserves that companies have now one year after the Covid-19 pandemic rather than back in 2019 or 2018. Hence we selected the biggest companies from the Fortune Global 500 list and focused particularly on the tech industry as it is true that these companies tend to have the most cash. We have selected the latest quarterly reports for each company and scoured the balance sheet to find out the cash reserves that these companies own. Due to the high liquidity of marketable securities we have considered them among cash equivalents as well though most other types of investments including long term investments have not been considered. Together these companies hold more than $1.1 trillion in cash alone which is truly an astonishing amount. So without further ado let's take a look at the companies which combined have more cash than most countries in the world starting with number 15:

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

BATH Maine — To address a growing need for diverse housing options a new affordable apartment complex was built in Bath and on Wednesday locals got to take a look during a grand opening.



Made possible through several tax credits and the guidance of MaineHousing the new 60-unit complex was developed by The Szanton Company and sits on the corner of Front and Summer streets.



Forty-two units will be reserved for those 55 and older and cost between $800 and $1500 a month to rent according to the developers.

""The mission of The Szanton Company is to create rental apartments that are moderate- to low-income which our tenants are proud to call home"" company President Nathan Szanton said at the grand opening.



The building also features several community spaces a rooftop deck and some mixed-use retail spaces some of which have already been renting before renovations and changes. Bookstore owner Jim Rice said as a retail and housing tenant seeing more affordable housing come to the downtown area is much-needed.

""Bath is in demand. It's really popular now and it's gotten more expensive"" Rice said. ""For me being right by the bookstore is ideal.""

Then it went bankrupt and now the shares are worth zero though you can find contrarian views.

Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

She started doing photography on the side while at BD which is now a full-time venture. Plus she owns a personal training business and a Reiki establishment.

Reiki is a “complementary health approach” where practitioners place their hands on or near a person to direct energy and help heal the individual according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

The center which is part of the National Institutes of Health said there’s no scientific evidence to support the existence of the energy field and no clear health-related results have been shown but also no harmful effects have been shown according to its website.

“I’m an entrepreneur so I am a certified personal trainer and I do personal training and fitness classes” Thomson said. “I also just started (practicing) Reiki.”

Her three Columbus-based establishments are Inspired by Soul Photography Columbus Reiki and Thomson Fit.

“Spirituality has always been something that interested me” Thomson said adding she had been interested in photography since she was young.

She began working at BD at age 18 and stayed for six years while building and exploring business opportunities. She learned about photography and in 2010 she started taking paid clients.

“It was very … part-time here and there when I was able to get it in because I was working for full-time at BD and I was a parent to young children” Thomson said. “In 2014 I was able to quit a full-time position at BD and do photography.”

She became a certified physical trainer in 2017 and started her fitness journey in 2013.

“The Reiki came about because I was diving a lot deeper into spirituality in metaphysics” Thomson added.

Her collaborator Leslie Karpisek said during this time people are looking for healing and have been open. Karpisek runs 2/11 Spirit Connections and also practices Reiki.

“I’m going to start marketing for myself because people are so receptive. Especially after the coronavirus we need so much healing” she said. “I am actually surprised how … people are open to spiritually at this time.”

As Reiki and their businesses expand in Columbus the relationship between the two also has grown.

The two met by chance in a parking lot last fall Karpisek said and started working together.

“She’s teaching me a lot about business” Karpisek said. “It’s like an energy exchange between her and I.”

Thomson is very smart and savvy in business Karpisek noted.

“She brings out the good in people” she added. “She has a gift for business.”

Thomson took a risk quitting BD Thomson noted. It was a big step she added and it took a lot to build the confidence to start marketing.

“It wasn’t until I finally felt like I could go out on a limb and really put myself out there into the public and provide that service to the public” she said. “The general public not just my friends and family like I had been doing for four years.”

She’s comfortable with her three businesses.

“I have lots of seniors and weddings coming up and then family sessions and milestone sessions with one-year-olds and lots of newborns so I don’t really have a lot of time to explore anything other than those three things” she said.

How did you prepare your agents to thrive during the pandemic and in this buzzing market with high demand but facing its share of challenges with supply?

CA: We are very big on training education and support and we’ve brought experts into the field to help agents understand how to position their buyers better than the competition so that they put their buyers in a strong light as a competitive offer.

Education and training provide agents with support make them the best at what they do in the industry and differentiate them.

Now that we are in 2021 and have our eyes set on the horizon what do you think will be some lasting changes at your company/firm?

CA: I think we found that we can reach more people through Zoom meetings. We will continue with the hybrid environment in our organizations so that we will have in-person and Zoom capability. We have a very large geographic footprint and we find that that will be a huge advantage for bringing people together and networking.

We will also continue to innovate digitally for both our agents and consumers. We realize that is not going away and it will become more a part of how we do business. Our office spaces will be set up differently to accommodate a more mobile environment.

With these changes you are implementing at your offices what are your thoughts on office space and the shift we may see regarding broker/owners managing their expenses?

CA: Ironically our top agents continue to work in the office and they like their space. We learned that we were using our space to its capacity which was 50% recently due to COVID.

Moving forward we think that we will have more market centers. We’ll consolidate offices and we’ll have large market centers and maybe outposts in certain towns with kiosks that will drive most of the services from a central office which might not be in that town.

Your firms serve a mix of areas in the Northeast; what do you see occurring during this booming housing market in places like New York Massachusetts Rhode Island and Connecticut?

CA: The New York City market is coming back quite nicely. Agents are starting to see multiple offers on a value-priced property and it’s all price-driven in New York because there is certainly a wonderful selection of products. The New York City market is different. It will take longer for it to become as robust as the suburbs but it’s positive and we feel really good about that.

The rest of our markets are suburban markets and they are as high as they’ve ever been. There is robust buyer demand and it continues. We do see more listings coming to market which is phenomenal. They’re going off the market as quickly as they are coming on but it’s at least satiating the buyers’ demand out there. I think that we will still see a very active market continue through the end of this year.

What are market predictions for the remainder of 2021?

CA: I think it’s going to become a nicely balanced market. We aren’t going to see buyers disappear and I don’t think interest rates will go up too much.

I think we will see more property come onto the market as people particularly empty nesters or those who want to downsize or move out of the northeast states will put their properties on the market.

There has been this migration out of the city and that will continue for the second home market. In the first quarter of 2021 74% of mortgages in Connecticut were second homes. We are going to continue to see a robust second-home market and Connecticut is one of the highest second home markets in the country because of people coming out of Manhattan.

Is there a call to action that you want to offer to real estate agents and brokers as we continue working in the 2021 housing boom?

CA: Our sales associates can no longer accept being anything other than absolute experts and they must have the highest level of knowledge about their communities and the transaction process. They are consultants and advisors. They are not information gatherers necessarily and I think everyone in this industry needs to put that best foot forward and make sure that they understand what their role is in the real estate transaction.

The couple has three children together Colt Ryland and Steely Rose.

Cole Hauser's acting career began alongside some of Hollywood's biggest names in 1990s hits like Dazed & Confused School Ties and Good Will Hunting. He continued with performances in blockbusters like Olympus Has Fallen and 2 Fast 2 Furious. But perhaps none of his roles have captured the hearts of viewers as his portrayal of fan-favorite Rip Wheeler in the TV drama Yellowstone. On the Paramount Network show he stars as a ranch hand alongside ranch owner and family patriarch John Dutton (Kevin Costner). Rip's steamy romantic relationship with Dutton's daughter Beth (Kelly Reilly) often leaves fans swooning and might have you wondering if Hauser is married in real life.

The answer is ... yes! Cole has been married to actress-turned-photographer Cynthia Daniel since 2006 and you might even recognize her famous face from her 1990s career.

Cynthia began modeling alongside her twin sister Brittany when they were 11 years old. They famously appeared in ads for Doublemint Gum as the Doublemint Twins.

From 1994-1997 the duo starred in the popular TV show Sweet Valley High as Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield. Cynthia appeared in Basketball Diaries and That 80s Show before retiring from acting in 2002. Cynthia is currently a professional photographer and has a company Five Arrows Photography.

Just four years after she retired from acting Cynthia and Cole tied the knot. There's not much known about how they met or their wedding but Cynthia frequently shares throwback photos on her Instagram account of the two.

In 2004 the couple welcomed their first child together Ryland. Four years later their second child Ryland was born and in 2013 their third child Steely Rose was welcomed into the world.





Although the two keep their family life fairly private in an interview with The Havok Journal in 2020 Cole opened up about his role as a father and husband ""I am always making time for each and every one of my children and also my wife also as a family together. I am good about making time for the whole family. You have to figure that balance out. But as a father and a husband you have to make the time and work just as hard at it.""

Hospital-level care at home—some of it provided over the Internet—is poised to grow after more than a decade as a niche offering boosted both by hospitals eager to ease overcrowding during the pandemic and growing interest by insurers who want to slow health care spending. But a host of challenges remain from deciding how much to pay for such services to which kinds of patients can safely benefit.

Under the model patients with certain medical conditions such as pneumonia or heart failure—even moderate COVID—are offered high-acuity care in their homes with 24/7 remote monitoring and daily visits by medical providers.

In the latest sign that the idea is catching on two big players—Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic—announced plans this month to collectively invest $100 million into Medically Home a Boston-based company that provides such services to scale up and expand their programs. The two organizations estimate that 30% of patients currently admitted to hospitals nationally have conditions eligible for in-home care. (KHN is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.)

Several other well-known hospital systems launched programs last summer. They join about two dozen already offering the service including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore Presbyterian Healthcare Services in New Mexico and Massachusetts General Hospital.

But hospitals have other financial considerations that are also part of the calculation. Systems that have built sparkling new in-patient facilities in the past decade floating bonds and taking out loans to finance them need patients filling costly inpatient beds to repay lenders and recoup investments.

And “hospitals that have surplus capacity whether because they have newly built beds or shrinking populations or are losing business to competitors are not going to be eager about this” said Dr. Jeff Levin-Scherz co-leader of the North American Health Management practice at consultancy Willis Towers Watson.

Medicare gave the idea a boost in November when it agreed to pay for such care to help keep non-COVID patients out of the hospital during the pandemic. Since then more than 100 hospitals have been approved by Medicare to participate although not all are in place yet.

Tasting opportunity Amazon and a coalition of industry groups in March announced plans to lobby for changes in federal and state rules to allow broader access to a wide range of in-home medical services.

“We’re seeing tremendous momentum” said Dr. Bruce Leff a Johns Hopkins Medical School geriatrician who has studied and advocated for the hospital-at-home approach since he helped establish one of the nation’s first programs in the mid-1990s.

Leff and other proponents say various studies show in-home care is just as safe and may produce better outcomes than being in the hospital and it saves money by limiting the need to expand hospitals reducing hospital readmissions and helping patients avoid nursing home stays. Some estimates put the projected savings at 30% over traditional hospital care. But ongoing programs are a long way from making a dent in the nation’s $1.2 trillion hospital tab.

While the goal is to shift 10% or more of hospital patients to home settings existing programs handle far fewer cases sometimes serving only a handful of patients.

“In a lot of ways this remains aspirational; this is the early innings” said Dean Ungar who follows the insurance and hospital industries as a vice president and senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service. Still he predicted that “hospitals will increasingly be reserved for acute care [such as surgeries and ICUs].”

Challenges to scaling up include maintaining the current good safety profile in the face of rapid growth and finding enough medical staff—especially nurses paramedics and technicians—who travel to patients’ homes.

The attraction for insurers is clear: If they can pay for care in a lower-cost setting than the hospital with good outcomes they save money.

For hospitals “the financials of it are frankly a little tough” said Levin-Scherz.

Those most attracted to hospital-at-home programs run at or near capacity and want to free up beds.

Even so Gerard Anderson a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health said hospitals likely see the potential long term for “huge profit margins” through “saving a lot of capital and personnel expense by having the work done at home.”

But Anderson worries that broad expansion of hospital-at-home efforts could exacerbate health care inequities.

“It’s realistic in middle- and upper-middle-class households” Anderson said. “My concern is in impoverished areas. They may not have the infrastructure to handle it.”

Suburban and rural areas—and even some lower-income urban areas—can have spotty or nonexistent Internet access. How will that affect the ability of those areas to participate to communicate with physicians and other hospital staff members miles away? Proponents outline solutions from providing patients with “hot spot” devices that provide Internet service along with backup power and instant communication via walkie-talkie-type handsets and computer tablets.

Social factors play a big part too. Those who live alone may find it harder to qualify if they need a lot of help while those in crowded households may not have enough room or privacy.

Another possible wrinkle: Not all patients have the necessary human support such as someone to help an ill patient with the bathroom meals or even answering the door.

That’s why both patients and their caregivers should get a detailed explanation of the day-to-day responsibilities before agreeing to participate said Alexandra Drane CEO of Archangels a for-profit group that works with employers and provides resources for unpaid caregivers.

“I love the concept for a resourced household where someone can take this job on” said Drane. “But there’s a lot of situations where that’s not possible. What If I have a full-time job and two children when am I supposed to do this?”

The programs all say they aim to reduce the burden on families. Some provide aides to help with bathing or other home care issues and provide food. None expects family members to perform medical procedures. The programs supply monitoring and communication equipment and a hospital bed if needed.

“We see the patient in their home setting” said Morre Dean president of Adventist Health’s hospital at home program which serves a broad area of California and part of Oregon. “What is in their refrigerator? What is their living situation? Can we impact that? We aren’t reliant on the family to deliver care.”

Patients are typically visited in their homes daily by various health workers. Physicians make home visits in some programs but most employ doctors to oversee care from remote “command centers” talking with patients via various electronic gadgets.

All of that was delivered to James Clifford’s home in Bakersfield California after he opted to participate in the Adventist program so he could leave the hospital and finish treatment for an infection at home. It required coordination—his wife had to be at their house for the set-up team even as she was scheduled to pick him up—but “once it was set up it worked well.”

At home he needed treatment with antibiotics every eight hours for several days and “one nurse came at 2 a.m.” said Clifford 70. “It woke up my wife but that’s OK. We had peace of mind by my being at home.”

Adventist launched its program a year ago but it hasn’t achieved the scale needed to save money yet said Dean. Ultimately he envisions the hospital-at-home option as “our biggest hospital in Adventist Health” with 500 to 1500 patients in the program at a time.

Medicare’s payment decision gave momentum to such goals. But the natural experiment it created with its funding ends when the pandemic is declared over. Because of the emergency Medicare paid the same as it would for in-hospital care based on each patient’s diagnosis. Will hospitals be as enthusiastic if that is not the case in the future? Commercial insurers are unlikely to pay unless they see lower rates since there are already concerns about overuse.

“From a societal perspective it’s great if these programs replace expensive inpatient care” said Levin-Scherz at Towers. But he said it would be a negative if the programs sought to grow by admitting patients who otherwise would not have gone into the hospital at all and could have been treated with lower-cost outpatient services.

There was a lot to be done when he arrived it seems and his stated quest to make the brand into a true Ferrari rival will not be achieved overnight.

That said there are reasons to be encouraged with work progressing on the mid-engined cars and the crucial DBX having been well received internationally. The hybrid Aston Martin is close too and will benefit from Mercedes-AMG input. The manual's confirmed demise is sad though far from the biggest surprise in the world. For the first time in a little while it seems there is good reason for optimism.

But we're not here to discuss future Aston Martins. Instead it's time to celebrate the fantastic secondhand ones out there - and there's good reason to do that. Popularity with buyers has ensured a steady supply of great looking great sounding sports cars for not all that much money. And who wouldn't be intrigued by that combination? Particularly with an aspirational badge on the nose.

Here then is a rundown of our best used Astons from hot hatch money to a lotto win. There are straight sixes V8s and V12s manuals and automatics two-doors four-doors coupes and convertibles - Astons of shapes and sizes for almost all budgets. So without further ado...

Up to £25000...

It's hard to imagine Aston Martin without the DB7 simply because the brand surely wouldn't exist today without it. Like so many other luxury manufacturers in the early nineties Aston was suffering thanks a global downturn. The Virage had only arrived at the end of the eighties but was pricey and unlike today the range was far less comprehensive. The '93 Vantage became a hero car for many but was more expensive again.

So thank goodness for the DB7. Yes it borrowed a lot from Jaguar and yes the straight-six was found lacking by a few but it was exactly the car Aston needed at the time. It looked stunning (still does actually) drove well enough and kept Aston afloat through the decade and into the VH era. A very significant car then.

Obviously everyone wants the V12 Vantage that arrived in 1999 and prices reflect that: the best of those including the run-out GT are more than £50k. That said others DB7s still represent an enticingly affordable way into Aston ownership with both higher mileage V12s and nice 3.2s available for £25k or less. Almost 30 years since its introduction the experience might leave something to be desired but classics are seldom this desirable - nor affordable. Ensure the cambelt has been changed on time for a 3.2 look out for rust and importantly make sure you're comfy - a DB7 is a snug fit...

Up to £35000...

As alluded to above the DB7 was going to take some replacing having single-handedly (and successfully) established Aston in a whole new sector. Fortunately the DB9 was just that car: the new look was far more modern yet just as attractive the VH architecture ensured space for human adults and the interior was a revelation back in 2003.

Perhaps the early cars didn't quite live up to the lofty (and maybe unobtainable) expectations set for the DB9 but it certainly came good in the end with more than ample performance from a 450hp version of the 5.9 V12 and dynamic abilities in a different league to the '7. With Coupe and Volante models manual and auto gearboxes plus a host of options - and those killer looks - the DB9 proved popular meaning there are plenty to be had secondhand.

At the time of writing there are more than 50 DB9s in the PH classifieds priced from less than £30k for early high mileage cars to in excess of £150k for the final Bond Editions. With £35k to spend a Coupe like this is available: a 2007 car in a great colour combination with 50000 miles. Of course it's going to cost a great deal more than a £35k new car to keep going but that's an awful lot of V12 Aston for 3 Series money. And there's plenty more where that came from...

Up to £45000...

Considered as a luxury saloon to rival the likes of the Bentley Flying Spur the Rapide came up short. Literally: it simply wasn't as commodious as many were expecting from a four-door four seat Aston Martin.

On the flipside here was a four-door four-seat Aston Martin that drove better than all its rivals much more like the 2+2 (and a bit more) DB9 that it could more accurately be described as. By the time of its 2010 introduction Aston was really into its stride with the VH cars and it showed in the Rapide a car far more athletic and rewarding than its billing could have ever implied.

The best Rapide is the 2013-on S with the eight-speed auto and 80 additional horsepower from the V12. But with prices starting at £35000 for the 470hp original - yes really - there is still a lot going for the standard Rapide. This car is £45k with 50000 miles - no one would ever guess you paid so little.

Up to £55000...

Perhaps the best known and surely the most successful of the 21st century Aston Martins the V8 Vantage really did have it all: gorgeous looks thunderous V8 suave interior and great handling. As with the DB9 the earliest ones perhaps didn't show the Vantage off to its best but it all came good eventually. Like really really good.

The 2008 facelift which brought the 4.7-litre and performance to match the soundtrack can be bought for less than £40k - a great buy they make too. With more in the kitty however some of the best V8 Vantages are within reach including the 2011-on V8 S. It brought in quicker steering a new Graziano gearbox a 30kg weight saving and bigger brakes for arguably the best series production V8 that emerged in its decade-and-a-bit on sale.

This one a great example of what AMG A45 cash can now buy; a 2013 Vantage S for sale at Aston Martin Works with just 17000 miles recorded. The Vantage has not been short of maladies over the past 15 years or so but a wealth of knowledge has built up around the cars as well. And predictable though it's going to sound you'd excuse a V8 Vantage quite a lot wouldn't you?

Up to £65000...

For a car first previewed as long ago as 1998 and the Project Vantage concept the V12 Vanquish still looks absolutely superb. Forget DB9s V8s and Rapides - the first Aston Martin of the 21st century might still be the best looking of them all.

The Vanquish wasn't just a new car for Aston of course - it was a whole new era. Out with the old handbuilt V8 warhorses in with aluminium architecture V12s and automated manuals. Imagine being concerned for the future when it was represented by the Vanquish! Sure the gearbox was never the best - even by the standards of the early 2000s - and it ages the car now. Manual conversions are possible but the work is expensive and converted cars carry a premium.

That said it's far easier to overlook gripes when presented with a V12 Aston icon for less than £65000. In the same way old manuals required patience so you'll have to learn to take it easy on early paddleshifts. And budget plenty for repairs... This car is 20 years old next year and has covered 38000 miles delivered new to Hugh Grant of all people. Sold following a recommission at Aston Works in 2019 with four new tyres a recent service and even the original phone it's £64000. What more could we possibly tell you than that?

Up to £85000...

With Aston on the brink of range-wide electrification the manual having no future and V12 not long for this world it's quite incredible to think that buyers could buy this model new as recently as 2011: a V12-powered Vantage with more than 500hp and a manual gearbox as the only transmission choice.

Aston Martin had teased the idea of its biggest engine in its smallest car back in 2007 with the RS Concept; while the production car that arrived in 2009 was less extreme (the RS potential eventually being realised with the GT12) it remained the most exciting Aston in years. There was no way that engine married to that shape couldn't be even if 'exciting' might have been the polite way to describe how it drove as well...

The rough edges of the V12 were smoothed out with the S of 2013 but it isn't hard to see the appeal of the wildchild original - one person's challenging is another's characterful after all. And from less than £70k too. This one has covered just 2000 miles a year from new with an asking price of £84950. Those who prefer their sports cars the old-fashioned way need look no further.

Up to £100000...

Those who prefer their sports a little more modern on the other hand should consider the DB11. The first car of the Second Century product plan it laid out Aston's stall brilliantly well: the new twin-turbo V12 was immense the new architecture further improved ride and handling and the styling met with widespread (if not universal) approval.

Though a subsequent AMR highlighted one or two less than perfect aspects of the original DB11 (which it actually replaced) those are easier to look more favourably on with the cars now half their new price. Yes the DB11 really was launched five years ago. The very cheapest cars are now under £90k with a £100000 budget bringing both V12 and V8 DB11s into play.

This 2017 car is Aston approved with just 13000 miles and a modest spec from the factory - a new raft of personalisation options for the DB11 meant a few bold choices emerged. Like the DB9 the '11 will continue to depreciate for a little while yet if not at the rate it once did. And as they say depreciation doesn't matter if you don't sell...

Up to £125000...

Aston Martin had its work cut out replacing the Vantage but thanks in no small part to an AMG-donated V8 the 2018 car was a fitting follow up. Building on the Second Century potential shown in the DB11 the Vantage was leaner and meaner than the V12 GT - and the better for it.

Though clearly still with a relaxed side the turbocharged Vantage was miles more capable (and faster) than its predecessor. The eight-speed auto was a much better fit than any of the automated manuals were the V8 still thundered and the sense of occasion was off the scale. Not everyone loved the looks and the interior was confusing but the Vantage did so much so well that the demerits weren't dealbreakers - it was a worthy replacement for a legend.

With the car having now been on sale for three years early Vantages are available from less than £90k; a £125000 maximum means nearly new cars are obtainable. But it also opens the door to the Vantage AMR with its manual gearbox and 100kg weight saving over standard. With the days of three-pedal Astons already numbered it would be a very hard one to resist.

Up to £150000...

We couldn't do a best Astons list without a convertible mentioned somewhere and we weren't simply going to make do with any old Volante. (Not least because so many drop-top Astons weren't all that well resolved design-wise.) No we wanted the best - and it's hard to think of anything better than a Vanquish S Volante. Look at it!

The V12 Vanquish never had a convertible version something its replacement rectified soon after launch. ""More exotic than the SLS and sportier than the Bentley GTC"" is how we summarised the Vanquish Volante adding that it was a ""much-needed lift from the DB9-based cars it supercedes"" - job jobbed.

But with those cars available from £115000 we need something even more special for this slot and the Vanquish S Volante is that car. Launched in 2017 it followed the template laid out by the coupe S of the previous year: 600hp from the V12 the eight-speed auto at last and a new setup to put distance between it and the new launched DB11. The Vanquish - indeed the entire VH era - was signing off in style. While cars like the GT12 and GT8 Vantages were more attention grabbing arguably nothing showed off quite what could be achieved with that engine and those underpinnings than the Vanquish - it really was delightful. Dated in areas for sure but joyous to drive.

A few years later the Vanquish S Volante still commands at least £140k so it's the natural fit here. Another Aston approved car its sombre colour combination hasn't harmed the Vanquish's impact one bit; for a car not universally loved at launch its ageing very nicely indeed. With 14000 miles recorded in three years this Volante has clearly been enjoyed - no reason for that to stop with a new owner.

Up to £200000

Objectively speaking the DBS Superleggera was a tricky one to explain. It wasn't very super light at all and the DB11 AMR that launched around the same sort of time undercut it significantly. With the same V12. And a top speed just 3mph less.

But if ever there was a car for real life rather than an on-paper comparison the DBS Superleggera was it. Because that gave you the chance to see its spectacular form up close to appreciate every detail and styling flourish - and to experience a 725hp Aston Martin.

That so much power was generated from a twin-turbo 5.2-litre V12 wasn't the surprise given the capacity and the forced induction; the surprise was in just how well the DBS coped with 725hp and 664lb ft - like it was always intended never to have a jot less. Performance was astonishing and the DBS drove beautifully; if the DB11 and Vantages were qualified successes the Superleggera was an immediate hit. If you could live with the interior.

In 2021 it's possible to pay £150k for a DBS and that includes approved ones. £200000 not only brings low mileage cars like this one into play but also DBS Volantes as well. Which is about as awesome as you might expect from a 700hp convertible Aston to be.

Sky's the limit...

What else could it be? For many the DB5 is still the first car that comes to mind when Aston Martin is brought up thanks to an association with a certain movie franchise. One Aston Martin remains only too keen to exploit if the latest DB5 Goldfinger cars are anything to go by.

There's not really a lot more to be said about not just the most famous Aston Martin of all time but one of the best-known cars in history. Right now the entry point is half a million for a car described as ""eminently usable"" - although not without a dealer offering a range of upgrades in addition - as if to suggest the DB5 dream may not exactly be found in a totally standard car. And their full restorations start at £299995...

But then no Aston Martin has ever come cheap and not least one that has achieved worldwide notoriety - especially with fewer than 900 made more than 50 years ago. This DB5 is especially appealing for not being Birch Silver and Dubonnet Rosso looks fantastic. With its original engine recently rebuilt and upgraded to 4.2-litres along with the gearbox it's described by the seller as ""much loved and cherished... regardless of cost."" Which makes sense given a car like this is now worth £700000. But then that isn't £3m which is what a Goldfinger costs. And this one can be driven on the road too; what an unmitigated joy that promises to be.

The Audio-Technica AT-LP60X is a budget record player which offers a bunch of excellent features and surprisingly good performance. It's perfect for people who just want a turntable without having to think too hard.

Despite its affordable $120 price this is no cheap suitcase-shaped toy but a stereo component which will work well with systems from $100 to $1000 and up. The AT-LP60X is super-simple to set up and just as easy to use. Sure it's constructed from plastic and it doesn't offer Bluetooth or even a headphone out but it does what it needs to well: play records.

Whether you're looking to resurrect a family member's old record collection or getting a start in the hi-fi hobby the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X offers a compelling mix of features and performance for the money.

Push the button

Ty Pendlebury/CNET

Manual turntables like the Pro-Ject T1 and the Fluance RT82 are great but they can be a bit intimidating for the first-time vinyl owner. The The Audio-Technica AT-LP60X is designed to lower the learning curve by offering automatic operation although you can use it in manual mode if you wish.

What does an automatic turntable do? It lets you simply press buttons to play records without having to lift the tonearm by hand. The LP60X has four buttons -- play stop speed (33 1/3/45 rpm) and tonearm up/down -- that allow it play back both singles (7-inches) and albums (12-inches) with ease.

As you might expect at this price level the buttons don't feel super-slick instead they click in a way that reminds me of old Sony Walkman controls. When I press the play button there's a definite ""clunk"" as the turntable activates the tonearm and swings it into position.

The ""hardest"" thing to remember when using this turntable is choosing the correct record size with the plinth-mounted lever although this is only an issue an if you switch between 45s and LPs regularly. If you own a bunch of 10-inch records or something else out of the ordinary you can always move the stylus to where you want it by grabbing the finger rest -- the record will start spinning when you lift. You can press the tonearm lift button to keep it suspended at the start of a song if want to do some backyard DJing for example and then press it again to play.

The LP60X features push-button operation. Ty Pendlebury/CNET

The player is barely the size of an LP in a plastic sleeve at 14.15 inches wide by 14.7 inches deep (and 3.84 inches high) so you shouldn't have any problem finding a sideboard or Ikea storage unit to fit it. The Audio-Technica comes in a choice of four colors: red black white and silver.

There's just a single output -- a 3.5mm jack which is unusual -- but an included adapter can convert it to the more standard stereo RCA cable. The device is switched to Line level by default so if you want to add your own phono preamp you select Phono via a switch at the back.

Setup was easier than any other turntable I recall. Simply put the platter on the spindle attach the drive belt and you're good to go.

Plastic but not a toy

There are plenty of other $100 record players that more readily qualify as toylike such as the Crosley 3-inch record player (or almost anything by Crosley really). One thing I quickly found out about the LP60X is that it doesn't sound like a kid's plaything.

If there's one cliché that's hard to shake it's that records are ""warmer"" than digital files. That's partly due to the medium itself -- secondhand records in particular can be quite worn -- but the record player and stylus can play a part too. Of course I've heard turntable setups that sound just as insightful and detailed as a hi-res file but they're not cheap.

When you choose a budget turntable you're probably not looking for transparency or soundstage you just want to dance or hang out in your pajamas. The Audio-Technica AT-LP60X is not the most detailed record player I've heard but it offers excellent mid-range and bass response for the price of a nice night out.

Ty Pendlebury/CNET

I enjoyed a bunch of different recordings on the Audio-Technica but it's weighty bass response worked best with harder styles like rock and dance. It was able to dig out the bottom few registers of Gorillaz's self titled record with ease for instance. Listening to XTC's Melt The Guns the competitive Victrola Eastwood had a brighter balance with less bass but it emphasized the click of the percussion which wasn't apparent with the Audio-Technica.

The main issue with the Victrola by the way wasn't the sound or its solid features (Bluetooth headphone out onboard speaker) but that it was easy to damage the record with the lid attached. This was not an issue with the LP60X.

One thing you wouldn't expect from an ultra-budget turntable is that the sound quality would scale with more expensive equipment. Hook a music jewellery box up to a costly stereo system for example and all you'll hear is louder tinkling. The Audio-Technica on the other hand really shone with a more expensive system where the bass in particular was able to stretch out.

Moving to a dedicated phono stage offers a nice upgrade path. With a Cambridge Audio Duo connected the bass firmed up and the upper registers came into a clearer focus. I haven't heard the Schitt Mani but it doesn't seem unreasonable to spend the same as the Audio-Technica again on a good phono preamp -- especially when the AT already gives you so much turntable for so little.

Easy like Sunday morning

If you have a pair of active speakers like the excellent Klipsch R-15PM or a tabletop speaker with an auxiliary input like the Google Home Max then the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X can really help complete your system. It will also pair well with a more contentional AV system for the occasional wind-down session perhaps with a snifter of port. It's a really flexible and easy-to-live-with turntable.

If you don't want to worry about getting on the endless turntable upgrade train if you just want to play records then a set-and-forget model is what you should get. One hundred and twenty dollars is the minimum anyone should spend on a turntable like that and that turntable is the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdGNvaW5idXp6LmlvL3Jldmlld3MvYWx0Y29pbi1wcm9qZWN0cy90b3AtMTAtcmVhc29ucy10by1idXktY29zbW9zLWF0b20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Reasons to Buy Cosmos (ATOM),"Famously dubbed the “Internet of blockchains” (IoB) Cosmos (ATOM) allows any blockchain network to communicate share and transact with any other blockchain.

Cosmos’s vision is to become the bridge between blockchains through a set of open-source tools like Tendermint the Cosmos SDK and IBC. Moreover these tools allow developers to build custom secure scalable and interoperable blockchain-based solutions.

ATOM the platform’s native cryptocurrency fuels the Cosmos Hub. In addition to executing smart-contracts ATOM is also used in completing transactions on the Cosmos network. Moreover the token is a license for its holders to vote validate or delegate to other validators. Here we discuss the top 10 reasons to consider including ATOM in your investment portfolio.

Technology

1) Tendermint: It is a solution that packages consensus and networking layers of a blockchain into a generic engine. This allows developers to focus more on the development of a protocol and less on its complexity. It not only allows the consensus mechanism to reach finality quickly but also increases the performance of the protocols. This is enabled by the algorithm which can handle up to thousands of transactions per second.

2) Varied Consensus: The consensus mechanism of Cosmos is largely dependent on the underlying applications. If an application defines that validators will be selected based on the number of tokens they stake then the Cosmos blockchain can be categorized as Proof-of-Stake (PoS). However if applications decide to restrict only a set of pre-authorized entities to validate transactions on the platform then the blockchain can be considered permissioned or private.

3) Cosmos SDK: It is a generalized architecture to simplify the process of building apps on top of Tendermint. Cosmos SDK intends to create a suite of modules that allows developers to easily spin applications without writing the code from scratch.

4) The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC): IBC allows developers to connect all the blockchains. This protocol leverages the instant finality property of Tendermint to allow blockchains to transfer data and tokens to each other. Therefore blockchains with different validator sets and applications can be made interoperable using Cosmos’s IBC protocol.

Solving Core Problems of Legacy Blockchains

5) Scalability: Cosmos leverages two kinds of scalability – vertical and horizontal. The network scales the blockchain and applications built on top of it using vertical scaling to process the maximum number of transactions per second. However at some point in vertical scaling the transaction throughput of a single chain reaches a point which it cannot surpass. This is where horizontal architecture comes in; to move the transactions to multi-chain architectures. Ultimately by running multiple chains in parallel Cosmos makes blockchains theoretically infinitely scalable.

6) Usability: In terms of usability developers lack flexibility when creating blockchain-based applications. Thanks to Cosmos SDK developers can now easily build entire application-specific blockchains that are flexible scalable and super-easy to use. Moreover the network allows the use of the Go programming language and a multi-layer structure. This works to further reduce the complexity of blockchain-based applications.

Team Developments and Progress

7) Team: Cosmos has huge support from several companies teams and foundations. Though the idea initially came from Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman who founded Tendermint the project received main support from The Interchain Foundation – a Swiss non-profit foundation.

Additionally Cosmos received support from the IRIS Foundation. The IRIS Foundation created the Cosmos Hub IRISnet to facilitate the construction of distributed business applications. Though it is difficult to distinguish the individual contribution of all entities they work together to support and develop Cosmos’ ecosystem.

8) The Ecosystem: Cosmos has attracted a lot of partners that are developing challenging solutions on its ecosystem. The list includes Binance Chain e-Money Kava Akash network Loom OKExChain Band Protocol Persistence and more. Over 100 different projects are currently building blockchain-based solutions on Cosmos Network and Tendermint technology.

9) Developments: The level of developments seen on the Cosmos platform continues to exceed expectation. If you look at the GitHub of Cosmos you’ll see the extensive work the team has put in to propel its vision of becoming the Internet of Blockchains (IoB).

10) Achievements as per the Roadmap: According to its roadmap Cosmos has already made staking and voting live in the first quarter of 2021. In the next quarter the team has plans to launch Gravity DEX to enable users to exchange cryptocurrencies from all over the interchain. Additionally a Gravity Bridge will be formed to enable Cosmos-based assets to flow into Ethereum’s ecosystem. The progress is right on track.

Conclusion

The future of the crypto industry will be built upon interoperable blockchains that are not only scalable but also make it easier for developers to build applications on them.

Cosmos is at the forefront of the cross-chain revolution. This is why major projects are leveraging Tendermint Cosmos SDK and IBC to build protocols. Working in unison with the crypto industry Cosmos works to achieve the next plateau of mainstream adoption.

But if you were handed a small suitcase full of money which one should you go for?

These cameras are very different propositions with different target audiences. But it's a fun question to answer all the same – and after a week of shooting with the Fujifilm GFX100S I've now been fortunate enough to use both cameras extensively in the real world.

Before I reveal my findings let's introduce the two contenders. The GFX100S is Fujifilm's latest medium format camera which means it has a sensor that's 1.7x larger than full-frame. In other words its light-gathering powers are off the scale and this brings all sorts of benefits like huge dynamic range.

Image 1 of 2 The Fujifilm GFX100S weighs a not inconsiderable 900g but isn't much heftier than its full-frame rival... (Image credit: Future) ...the Sony A1 which weighs 737g with a battery and SD card. (Image credit: Future)

But the full-frame Sony A1 isn't exactly in its shadow either. When I reviewed the A1 in March I called it ""probably the most versatile professional camera ever made"". It's an amazing technical accomplishment albeit one that costs $6500 / £6499 / AU$10499 (body only).

What's interesting about both the Fujifilm GFX100S and Sony A1 is that they break boundaries in different ways. Medium format cameras are traditionally expensive slow and cumbersome but not the GFX100S. It's a fair chunk cheaper than the Sony A1 ($5999 / £5499 / AU$9499) and has similar handling to the Fujifilm X-T4 making it extremely responsive and easy to use. The Sony A1 meanwhile is simply more versatile than any 50.1MP full-frame camera has any right to be.

This is the first time since photography’s digital revolution where a medium format camera has been priced lower than a rival full-frame camera at launch – and to say that's an exciting proposition for a landscape photographer is something of an understatement.

And that's the crux of the Fujifilm GFX100S vs Sony A1 debate. Like most photographers I specialize in certain genres – and being predominantly a landscape and portrait photographer I have no real need for the incredible shooting speed or extensive video powers of the Sony A1. After spending a week with the GFX100S I'm completely smitten with it.

Nailing the fundamentals

When it comes to landscape photography the bells and whistles that come with most mirrorless cameras don't really matter. This is because the vast majority of shots are taken in either manual or aperture priority mode with focus performed using either manual or autofocus depending on the scene.

A 30fps burst mode or rhinoceros AF isn't really top of the priority list. Instead for this type of photography it all comes down to the camera's handling and the core features: sensor size resolution dynamic range and the bit depth of raw files for color reproduction.

Grips on the front and back of the camera make the Fujifilm GFX100S comfortable to hold for long periods and a better ergonomic fit than the Sony A1. (Image credit: Future)

The Fujifilm GFX100S and Sony A1 do both offer big benefits for landscape shooters. They can both easily autofocus when a 10-stop ND (Neutral Density) filter is attached to the lens which is great because it makes techniques like focus stacking easy. The two cameras also provide a live histogram in the electronic viewfinder and on the LCD screen for checking exposure while shooting although the GFX100S’s top-plate OLED can also handily be set to display a histogram.

This is the first time since photography’s digital revolution where a medium format camera has been priced lower than a rival full-frame camera at launch.

But one area where the GFX100S and also many Fujifilm cameras are head-and-shoulders above Sony cameras is that they provide exposure times that are way longer than 30 seconds. This means you can shoot long exposure photos without needing to use a remote to hold the shutter open in Bulb mode all while trying to manually time the exposure.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

The Sony A1's shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/8000 sec and it also offers a Bulb mode (which lets you keep the shutter open for as long as you want). The GFX100S on the other hand offers shutter speeds ranging from 60 minutes to 1/4000 sec as well as Bulb up to a maximum of 60 minutes.

After 30 seconds exposure times double as normal so you only need to shoot in Bulb mode when you need an exposure time between two stops. Also when shooting in Bulb mode the GFX100S shows an on-screen timer to help you with timing the exposure – the A1 meanwhile shows you a blank screen so you need to use a watch or phone.

Aside from specific talents like this both cameras are surprisingly similar considering they're very different takes on the flagship camera. Both are excellent performers at high ISO settings both feature dual SD card slots and both have articulating screens.

Another difference here though is that the Sony A1 only flips out on the horizontal axis for shooting on landscape format whereas the GFX100S' screen flips out on both the horizontal and vertical axis for shooting in both orientations.

Image 1 of 2 The Fujifilm GFX100S' screen handily flips out in both horizontal and vertical directions... (Image credit: Future) ...whereas the Sony A1's display is a more limited tilt-screen and is lower resolution. (Image credit: Future)

I also found the GFX100S much easier to set up and use thanks to its overall control layout top-plate OLED screen for displaying a range of handy information and its more intuitive menu system. Still the A1 does at least offer an incredible level of customization to help you get it set up for your needs.

But what about the million dollar (or rather $6000) question: how does the actual photo quality between the GFX100s and A1 compare? It's a close battle but for landscape shooting the GFX100S has the edge with a few caveats...

Read our in-depth Sony A1 review

Glass ceiling

The Fujifilm GFX100S may only have a 14-stop dynamic range compared to the Sony A1's 15 stops but the medium format camera has the edge when it comes to image quality. But it's not quite as cut-and-dried as that sounds as the GFX100S' high-resolution sensor puts a much heavier demand on lenses.

As you probably know the higher a camera's resolution the better the lenses have to be to resolve all that captured detail. And the problem with the Fuji's 102MP sensor compared to the Sony A1’s 50.1MP chip is that the lenses you use must be absolutely flawless to give it a genuine real-world advantage.

Older Fujifilm G-mount lenses like the GF 23mm f/4 can struggle with a loss of edge sharpness but that's not a problem with recent ones like the GF 80mm f/1.7 (announced in January this year). (Image credit: Future)

Some of the older Fujifilm GFX lenses such as the 23mm show a much greater loss of edge sharpness when compared to Sony's 20mm for instance. But to be honest to notice this you have to really pixel peep and in reality the results from the camera and lens paring are absolutely fine in both print and digital display.

In terms of color the GFX100S beats the Sony A1 with the option of 14- or 16-bit raw files compared to just 14-bit with the A1. While that may not sound like much this lets you push raw files harder during processing if necessary as well as being able to capture many more colors for smoother graduations from one color to the next. If you shoot landscapes that's a big deal.

These are the best mirrorless cameras you can buy right now

Counting the cost

In any discussion about buying one of these cameras you have to factor in the price of lenses. And this is where the real-world cost of the GFX100S starts to add up. It might be a slightly cheaper camera body but generally speaking its medium format lenses are slightly larger heavier and to varying degrees more expensive.

Let's do some slightly painful financial sums. When you compile a kit consisting of a camera body and three comparable lenses the price difference between a Sony A1 and a Fujifilm GFX100S suddenly evens out.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

For landscape photography with the GFX100S the ideal combo is probably the Fujifilm GF 23mm F/4 R LM WR lens (equivalent to an 18mm full-frame lens) GF 32-64mm f/4 R LM WR (a 25-51mm equivalent) and GF 80mm F1.7 R WR Lens (like a 60mm prime on the A1). The total cost of that lot with the camera body? A mere $13196 / £12146 / AU$20396.

Being able to buy a medium format kit for practically the same price as a full-frame kit is truly amazing and completely changes the way photographers will view this larger format.

With Sony's system the equivalent lenses are the Sony FE 20mm f/1.8 G Sony FE 50mm f/1.2 GM and Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM. If you buy those with a Sony A1 your bank account would be relieved of $11595 / £11346 / AU$17956.

This particular example makes the Sony A1 a fair bit cheaper than its Fujifilm rival but not by a huge amount. And being able to buy a medium format kit for practically the same price as a full-frame kit is truly amazing and completely changes the way photographers view this larger format; something that once seemed unaffordable suddenly becomes a more attainable dream.

Master of one

The Sony A1 is without doubt an incredible camera. But its rounded feature set suggests that it's more a proof-of-concept to show off Sony's technological prowess rather than a real-world camera that will take the photographic market by storm.

Saying that the camera is undoubtedly ideal for press and sports photographers working across a range of subjects where such a universal camera can replace the need for carrying two different types of camera bodies such as the Sony A7R IV and Sony A9 II (£4922). The A1 is more than capable of shooting professional video too.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

But the problem with the Sony A1 for photographic specialists at least is that it provides so many features and functions that simply aren’t relevant to your needs despite its universal abilities.

For photographers who mainly focus in one or two genres of photography where detail is key such as product portrait or landscape shooting a specialist camera like the Fujifilm GFX100S is a much smarter buy.

In fact a 102MP medium format camera that doesn’t weigh a tonne and produces incredibly detailed images is really the ultimate landscape photography tool – albeit one that commands a price tag that's as epic as the scenes you'd hope to capture with it."

San Antonio is tunneling into cyber-security. And Los Angeles is paving the way for computer-driven rapid-response “smart” manufacturing.

St. Paul is poised to become a manufacturing research hub in its own right but think lab coat not foreman hardhat.

In October the U.S. Department of Defense announced it would allocate $87.5 million to launch BioMADE a non-medical bio-industrial manufacturing institute housed at the University of Minnesota College of Biological Science’s Cargill Building as well as in new lab space that will break ground on the St. Paul campus in September.

BioMADE the ninth nonprofit manufacturing institute sponsored by the Dept. of Defense is expected to attract $180 million from non-federal sources and seed satellite offices in Cambridge Mass. and Berkeley Calif.

The goal is to train up a qualified workforce and get research and design innovations over the proverbial “valley of death” where promising technology break-throughs tend to die for lack of scale funding and exposure and into the hands of the private sector for corporate investment and commercial production.

“Friends the bio-revolution is here” said U of M President Joan Gabel during the nonprofit institute’s recent virtual launch event.

A BIO-TECH FUTURE?

St. Paul bio-industrial capital of America? For a capital city that prides itself on its century-old parks and historic landmarks diving headlong into the sometimes strange uncertain future of bio-technology may strike some observers as an unlikely pairing.

The metro and east metro in particular is better known for medical device manufacturers such as Medtronic consumer products companies such as Ecolab and 3M and agribusiness such as CHS Inc.

While the University of Minnesota has maintained a biotechnology institute for decades biotech as a private sector enterprise has just begun to gain a small foothold in St. Paul. On Empire Drive Bio-Techne the state’s largest biotechnology company opened a lab facility last September where a dozen or so microbiologists cook lab-grown recombinant proteins essential ingredients for manufacturers of new cell therapies.

The goal of BioMADE is to grow that number both locally and nationally jumpstart research into bio-industrial manufacturing and hopefully seed a lot more companies to come.

The institute officially opened its doors with a virtual launch party on April 28 that featured pre-recorded accolades from U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack U of M Board of Regents Chair Ken Powell former chief executive officer of General Mills and other notables from the halls of science and industry.

“This is one of the most exciting initiatives to come before the board during my tenure” Powell said.

A ‘GROWING’ INDUSTRY

So what exactly is non-medical bio-industrial manufacturing?

In a nutshell the industry engineers bacteria yeast algae and other biological agents that in turn create new chemical compounds and materials. Resulting products — such as plant-based biofuels — can roll out without the environmental impacts of fossil-fuel heavy traditional production.

U of M researchers for instance are developing anti-biocorrosion coatings for ships and enzymes that can purify drinking water and conserve swimming pool water. Elsewhere private companies are developing fire-resistant composite materials for the aerospace industry and films for electronic touch screens and circuit boards.

While based in St. Paul BioMADE was proposed to the feds by the California-based Engineering Biology Research Consortium which has ties to more than 30 companies 33 universities 24 community colleges and six nonprofits across 31 states. Cargill played a key role in bringing the initiative to St. Paul as did the U of M.

Even before BioMADE was on the table the U of M planned to break ground in September on a Microbial Cell Production Facility which BioMADE CEO Douglas Friedman said in a statement aligns well with the nonprofit’s goals. That and additional lab space in St. Paul will be made available for private companies to scale up their projects.

‘IN MANY WAYS BIOPMADE IS THE FACILITATOR’

Friedman said BioMADE will work with companies to determine their priorities and develop product calls or requests for proposals where universities can show off how they would fill those needs through their own research. BioMADE comes to the table with funding and the ability to attract more. For major corporate partners tiered annual membership dues range from $50000 to $1 million annually while small labs pay as little as $1000 and two-year colleges and educational nonprofits pay as little as $100.

“In many ways BioMADE is the facilitator” said Friedman during the April 28 launch. “We want companies to be able to access infrastructure when they need it to be able to put products in and have them fail faster — yes I said fail faster because the faster you fail the sooner you can move on to the next one (and) the less investment you make.”

About 20 percent of its investments will be focused on “high-risk high-reward results” he said.

U of M Vice President for Research Christopher Cramer said in a written statement that the U.S. “bio-based economy” is thriving at $1 trillion annually and some projections have it growing to as much as $4 trillion in worldwide impact annually over the next 10-20 years.

“This institute will ensure that this growing national industry is a key part of our Bold North economy” Cramer said. “It will accelerate growth of our bio-industrial ecosystem create jobs for a newly trained workforce and add to and complement our current industries.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Years after Lisa Stockman-Mauriello participated in the ALS ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" she started losing her breath easily herself a victim of the disease.

Worse in January she learned she's one of 15% of ALS patients with a rare genetic mutation.

""Some people have three to five years before they lose the functionality and she's losing it over weeks"" husband Bob Mauriello said.

After helping others for so long she now has to lean on her husband and sons ages 14 to 22 for basic tasks.

""She couldn't sign our taxes last week"" Mauriello said. ""Now just walking out here for the interview she lost her balance. Two months ago she was doing mother-son dances like you would normally do at a wedding. We recorded those for the boys' weddings.""

The 51-year-old's cognition is intact and after a career doing communications for pharma companies now her life-saving pleas to one Biogen have been rejected five times.

The company is in Phase 3 clinical trials of the medicine Tofersen.

""This is Lisa's best hope we feel"" Dr. Neil Schneider said.

But she was diagnosed one week after enrollment closed.

Schneider the director of the world renown Eleanor and Lou Gehrig ALS Center at Columbia University's Irving Medical Center is asking Biogen to give Lisa the treatment immediately.

The Food and Drug Administration's Expanded Access program provides the option to help patients in serious condition with no alternative.

More than 100000 people have signed a petition of support and recently the company said after the trial in July patients like Lisa can get Tofersen.

An interfaith coalition is praying she makes it to her July 15 birthday.

""We're getting prayer quilts and rosary beds and ... it has been amazing"" Mauriello said.

Biogen declined CBS2's multiple requests for an on-camera interview. In a statement the company said it is not fair to ask study participants to continue to receive placebo while access is offered to others.

""That's an excuse"" said Peter Pitts a former FDA commissioner. ""There isn't a single patient out there with ALS that I believe would deny the use.""

Pitts added her data would not be included in the FDA's final review.

But another expert speculated that the company doesn't want to risk negative publicity if it fails.

""And they may not be ready to set the actual cost or price"" said Bruce Y. Lee professor at CUNY School of Public Health.

The family isn't giving up hope but is already fundraising to establish a health communications program at Lisa's alma mater the University of North Carolina.

""And just kind of make more Lisas the world would be a better place with more Lisas"" Mauriello said.

The FDA says there have been thousands of instances where companies have offered the experimental drug to patients before a trial ends.

One bill in congress would help drug companies cover the cost of offering experimental drugs.

""Waiting a month or six months or two years for approval they're not going to be around or not living the life they're living today so if we can stop this disease in its tracks we want to do it for one patient at a time"" said Dr. Danielle Carnival CEO I AM ALS a patient-led nonprofit.

She said the bipartisan Promising Pathway Act was would require the FDA to create a prioritized high-speed lane for evaluating drugs intended to treat prevent or diagnose serious or life-threatening diseases.

""It provides a pathway where FDA would be able to say 'We're conditionally approving this drug.' We're saying there's enough of a need in the patient community that this should be out there while we continue to do testing and that was introduced last week"" said Carnival.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Alexander Richter 22 May 2021

Ormat Technologies has received the go ahead for a new 40 MW development at the San Emidio geothermal field in Nevada by the Bureau of Land Management.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Nevada office announced a Record of Decision for the North Valley Geothermal Development Project San Emidio Geothermal Field proposed by Ormat Technologies Inc. which will produce climate-friendly renewable energy for Nevada and California. This project supports the Biden-Harris administration’s Executive Order Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad by expanding renewable energy opportunities on public lands. The project went under an environmental impact assessment by BLM in a process started in June 2020.

“The Black Rock Field Office works hard and in coordination with experts and Tribal neighbors to expand development of renewable energy sources such as geothermal where appropriate on public lands” said Black Rock Field Manager Mark Hall.

The project will upgrade the current plant and build a new power plant to produce up to 40 MW of electricity. Construction will include a substation up to 26 total geothermal production and injection wells approximately 7.5 miles of aboveground pipelines and an approximately 58-mile long 120-Kilovolt overhead power line originating at the power plant that will terminate at the NV Energy Eagle Substation near Fernley Nevada.

The 24000-acre San Emidio Geothermal Unit includes nine federal geothermal leases and is located in the San Emidio Desert approximately 15 miles southwest of Gerlach Nevada. The area has a long history of geothermal exploration and production that began in the late 1980s with the construction of the 3.6-megawatt Empire Geothermal Plant. Development and production of the San Emidio geothermal resource has continued since then the plant facilities were expanded to produce 11.8 MW in 2012. The final environmental assessment includes revisions such as additional analysis of hydrogeologic data that were not included in two draft environmental assessments published in 2020.

During a 30-day comment period held in Jan. 2020 nine comments were received from partner agencies and 42 substantive comments were received from the public. A second 30-day comment period was held in June 2020 and 11 comments were received from partner agencies and 71 substantive comments from the public.

Based on comments by the tribe the Black Rock Field Office held a third 15-day comment period in November 2020. The majority of the comments were from the tribe adjacent to the project area and resulted in a monitoring plan to address the tribe’s concerns.

All comments received are summarized in the Public Scoping Report which can be viewed along with other project documents at: https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/1503204/510.

For you what defines a Cork person?

Cork people have a great sense of humour we have a different wit charm and character down here. I have travelled around the world with athletics so I appreciate Cork people a lot when I come home.

Where is your go to place to eat in Cork?

I have a great connection with SoHo and Seanie McCarthy who owns it was a famous Cork hurler. When I won the in Moscow they erect a bar and held a homecoming ceremony for me there.

Tell us are you into tripe drisheen and Tanora- real Cork favourites?

We used to have tripe and drisheen every Friday growing up it was a big tradition in our house. Marian’s mother would still make it for me because Marian absolutely hates it! I don’t drink any fizzy drinks to be honest I would rather save my bad calories for wine.

Other than yourself who would you nominate to be on a Cork hall of fame?

In the arts you have the likes of Rory Gallagher and Cillian Murphy. In the world of sports there is Marcus O’Sullivan and Sonia O’Sullivan and Roy Keane would have been a huge hero of mine growing up.

What are the most typical phrases you would hear in Cork?

I don’t know if they are suitable for print! I would call them terms of endearment and it is all about the way they are said and expressed so they could come across very different in print than they do in person.

What is the biggest hidden treasure in Cork?

The Atlantic pond and the railway line it is just a beautiful place. I bought a house there recently and you always meet brilliant characters down there. It is a beautiful part of the city with the water on one side the trees on the marina and the views of Blackrock Castle."

Ever notice how there’s never any commercials for McDonalds on The Weather Channel? Their parent company Weather Group LLC and Entertainment Studios Networks Inc both owned by Byron Allen thinks it’s because McDonalds is racist and they’re suing them for $10 billion as a result.

In a lawsuit filed this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court Byron Allen’s companies filed a complaint alleging that “McDonald’s intentionally discriminated against Entertainment Studios and Weather Group through a pattern of racial stereotyping and refusals to contract” in violation of federal and state law.

Byron Allen acquired the Weather Channel in 2018 through his Entertainment Studios paying previous owners The Blackstone Group Bain Capital and Comcast/NBCUniversal an estimated $300 million. Just 10 years earlier the Weather Channel was acquired by Bain Capital Blackstone Group and NBCUniversal for $3.5 billion.









Allen an African-American got his start in television as the teenage co-host of the early 1980’s reality show “Real People” on NBC. Since then he’s developed a media empire owning other properties such as Cars.tv Pets.tv and Recipe.tv along with 23 ABC/NBC/CBS/FOX network affiliate broadcast stations in 19 U.S. markets. At the time of the Weather Channel purchase Allen praised the Weather Channel’s role of keeping America safe.

“The Weather Channel is one of the most trusted and extremely important cable networks with information vitally important to the safety and protection of our lives” said Allen in a statement “We welcome The Weather Channel which has been seen in American households for nearly four decades to our cable television networks division.”

However since Allen’s purchase of the network the lawsuit alleges that McDonalds has refused to advertise even though they have “purchased significant advertising on similarly situated white-owned networks.”

“This is about economic inclusion of African American-owned businesses in the U.S. economy” said Allen. “McDonald’s takes billions from African American consumers and gives almost nothing back. The biggest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America and McDonald’s is guilty of perpetuating this disparity. The economic exclusion must stop immediately.”

On the same day the lawsuit was filed McDonalds announced they were increasing spend with “diverse-owned media content and production partners.”









“We’ve been making serious commitments that are guided by our values and with this latest move we’re taking action to advance diverse-owned companies across the marketing supply chain” said Morgan Flatley Chief Marketing and Digital Customer Experience Officer McDonald’s USA. “We’re using our resources to support these platforms and businesses which keep the brand at the center of culture while creating deeper relationships with our diverse customers crew and employees.”

“As a Black female entrepreneur I am proud to be a part of McDonald’s continued effort to meet Women and diverse-owned businesses where they are by providing much-needed resources to do business in an ever-evolving marketplace” said Vicki Chancellor Chair McDonald’s USA Franchisee Marketing Committee. “It’s who we are as a leading brand that is doing our part to help underserved communities thrive.”

According to a statement released by McDonalds they plan to increase national investments in diverse-owned companies from 4% to 10%; specifically spend with black-owned media and production properties will increase from 2 to 5% with additional investments going to other segments including Hispanic Asian Pacific American Women and LGBTQ-owned properties.

McDonalds’ response to the lawsuit filed on the same day of their announcement was brief: “We will review the complaint and respond accordingly.”

The lawsuit claims McDonalds violated federal and California state law prohibiting racial discrimination in contracting and seeks actual and triple damages along with attorney fees and legal costs estimating that the total sum exceeds $10 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzIzL2xpZmVzdHlsZS8xMC1sb2NhbC1vdXRkb29yLXlvZ2EtZXZlbnRzLWdldC15b3VyLXplbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 local outdoor yoga events to get your zen,"As the promise of summer looms large it’s only natural to want to soak up the long sunny days after the dreary cooped-up winter.

“Many people have asked about the beautiful Boeing 757 that became so iconic during the Trump rallies. It was effectively kept in storage in Upstate New York in that I was not allowed to use it during my presidency. It is now being fully restored and updated and will be put back into service sometime prior to the end of the year. It will soon be brought to a Louisiana service facility for the completion of work inspection and updating of Rolls-Royce engines and a brand new paint job. When completed it will be better than ever and again used at upcoming rallies!” he enthused in an emailed statement.

Trump’s personal plane with his name emblazoned on its side was frequently seen as a backdrop during rallies. And while campaigning if you saw a photo of him aboard a plane noshing on KFC it was on this Boeing equipped with seat buckles covered in 24-karat gold and ornate bathrooms to match.

It’s unclear who may have been wondering about the plane especially given the fact that CNN ran a whole story in March about its location and condition. That story was called “Glory days of Trump’s gold-plated 757 seem far away as plane sits idle at a sleepy airport.”

Since his ban from major social media platforms the one-term Republican president has been using emailed statement to convey the often-anodyne sentiments he once relied on Twitter to disperse. Occasionally these statements still include Twitter-specific characters like @ symbols. Often multiple hit the inboxes of supporters and journalists in the course of a single day.

Throughout his public life Trump has often cited “many people” who he doesn’t name but who he insists say things to him which he then responds to in speeches posts or statements.

Much of what Trump said in his sudden and inexplicable Friday statement was covered in CNN’s two-month-old piece but proves once again there are always two ways to look at even the most basic stories.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1oaWRlcy03MzctbWF4LWZyb20tcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"American Airlines Hides ""737 MAX"" From Passengers","After the Boeing 737 MAX was grounded in the aftermath of two fatal crashes Southwest passengers were freaking out over a safety card – thinking they were flying on MAX which wasn’t supposed to be in commercial service.

Southwest Airlines used the same safety card for Boeing 737-800 and 737 MAX aircraft and so the card had both aircraft names on it. That was confusing to passengers so Southwest came up with new safety cards.

American Airlines has gone in the reverse direction. Their safety cards now say Boeing 737 whether it is a MAX or not.

The crew admin screen on the aircraft still shows ‘737 MAX’ so it’s just the customer facing seat back paper that appears to have been changed.

Boeing has made a run at rebranding the plane in light of its history. Since then new delivery MAX aircraft were even grounded for electrical issues.

However American Airlines offers

Our fleet harmonization plan began a few years ago and part of that plan included the standardization of safety cards including for Boeing 737 and Airbus 321 aircraft. The approach for the MAX safety card is consistent with other fleet types where we do not have different safety cards for sub-fleets.

It’s odd to me to call the 737 MAX a ‘subfleet’ rather than a different aircraft type. It isn’t just a group of planes that meet requirements for flying overwater such as carrying rafts (and American isn’t even putting rafts in all of its narrowbodies in order to eliminate subfleets). And suggesting it is a mere subfleet rather than a distinct plane is consistent with… minimizing the fact that passengers are flying on the 737 MAX.

I generally believe that the plane is quite safe and passengers will get over any concerns about flying on it however I’m not sure removing markers for passengers that they’re flying the mask is the best way of getting there."

He was 55.

Andre Ribeiro a one-time Indianapolis 500 starter who gave Honda its first INDYCAR SERIES victory and later drove for Team Penske has died of cancer in his native Brazil. He was 55.

Born in Sao Paulo Ribeiro was a key member of a Brazilian revolution of drivers in the top level of North American open-wheel racing. His rookie class at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1995 included fellow countrymen Gil de Ferran and Christian Fittipaldi and they helped set the stage for Helio Castroneves Tony Kanaan Bruno Junqueira and Cristiano da Matta among others to race in North America.

Ribeiro’s four seasons in CART were highlighted by a 1995 victory from the pole at New Hampshire Motor Speedway which was Honda’s first win in the sport. That was the first of his three victories for with Tasman Motorsports the team that brought him to the U.S. through Indy Lights.

He won four races as an Indy Lights rookie in 1994 finishing second in the standings to teammate Steve Robertson and one position ahead of Greg Moore who went on to win five CART races.

Ribeiro started 12th and finished 18th in the 1995 Indianapolis 500 in the No. 31 LCI International Reynard/Honda in his only start in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.”

In 1996 Ribeiro scored a popular victory in CART’s first race in Brazil. Ribeiro held off Al Unser Jr. by two seconds to capture the second of his three career victories. He added another victory later that season at Michigan International Speedway edging Bryan Herta. That was Ribeiro’s best season finishing 11th in the standings after leading 166 laps.

Ribeiro joined Roger Penske’s organization for CART’s 1998 season which was his last in the sport after 68 career starts. He retired at the end of the year at age 32.

Ribeiro spent the next chapter of his life leading a group of auto dealerships owned by Penske in Sao Paulo.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At first Belogour who goes by “Paul” was received as something of a novelty. An idiosyncratic character with long hair and scant online footprint he had amassed a small fortune in the largely unregulated world of foreign exchange trading—and then came to Vermont to spend it in eccentric ways. He bought a maple sugar farm an entire marina and a plot of undeveloped wood where he planned to build among other things a Viking-themed “luxury hideaway” which he describes as “the Disney of the North.”

“His choices of what to invest in are certainly eclectic I would say” Brattleboro Selectboard member Tim Wessel told The Daily Beast. “Clearly he likes the water so he bought a marina. And clearly he likes beer so he bought a brewery. It’s kind of like well if I had that kind of money maybe I’d be doing the same thing.”

But a few months before the pandemic Belogour’s shopping spree accelerated. The 50-year-old multimillionaire whose exact net worth is unknown joined the crowd of billionaires and oligarchs looking to buy up rural property and began closing real estate deals at a rapid clip. In the past two years alone the foreign exchange trader has snagged more than 3100 acres across three Vermont counties including 10 buildings lots and businesses at a cost of more than $3 million.

“Vermont only has 635000 people” said Dan Normandeau a realtor who worked with Belogour on three different properties. “Brattleboro itself has somewhere around 12000 people. So no we don’t see that. I shouldn’t say it never happens but it’s certainly caught people’s attention.”

The rapid consolidation of land became a cause for some concern: “You hear things like ‘Oh my God that guy from Gilford is buying all this property’” said Jeff Potter publisher of the local nonprofit newsroom The Commons. Facebook groups for local Vermonters filled with speculation about his acquisitions history and motives. Many were supportive; more than a few skewed xenophobic. One Brattleboro resident who asked not to be named said locals had coined an inaccurate nickname “the Russian” even though Belogour hails from Belarus. He’d hear “The Russian bought this the Russian bought that” he said “the Russian bought the outlet center on the highway the Russian bought the mattress store.”

Mounting curiosity about Belogour’s properties reached fever pitch earlier this month when four local news outlets—several of which had reported on Belogour himself—announced that he had bought them all. In total he acquired two local newspapers The Brattleboro Reformer and The Bennington Banner; a weekly called The Manchester Journal; and the bi-monthly UpCountry Magazine. On Friday the currency trader with no prior news experience was named president and publisher of all four.

The announcement spurred a new round of worrying. One blogger wondered whether Belogour shared the Belarusian government’s attitudes toward media censorship. But other concerns were more justified—in 2015 the same papers had sold to a subsidiary of Alden Capital the hedge fund dubbed “one of the most ruthless of the corporate strip-miners seemingly intent on destroying local journalism” which had gradually trimmed their budgets in one case leaving just a single reporter to cover an entire county.

In Bernie Sanders’ home state Wessel said many residents are skeptical of the influence of outside capital particularly from the finance industry. “There’s a lot of progressive thinking here” he noted “a lot of anti-capitalist thinking.”

“ Mounting curiosity reached a fever pitch earlier this month when four local news outlets—several of which had reported on Belogour himself—announced that he had bought them all. ”

Belogour first encountered Vermont in 2008 when he and his wife bought a farm just south of the state border in the town of Bernardston. Though the land is technically in Massachusetts Belogour frequently crossed the border into Brattleboro. “If you want to go get groceries” he told The Daily Beast “it’s closer to me than anything else in Massachusetts.”

After a few years the trader started to buy some other properties—in 2016 he bought Norm’s Marina along the Connecticut River in Hinsdale New Hampshire—before zeroing in on southern Vermont. In addition to the four papers Belogour has bought 1600 acres in Halifax 1500 acres in Guilford a former Knights of Columbus building in Rutland a brewery in Springfield an ex-marble factory in Proctor and seven properties in Brattleboro including a former handbag factory and a mattress store. Earlier this year he bid $3.95 million for a former college campus in Bennington but lost the auction to a medical provider.

Belogour’s properties are now so numerous that he isn’t sure of the exact number. “I don’t know” he told The Daily Beast. The forex trader initially guessed he owned “seven or eight properties in Vermont” then adjusted it to “eight or 10 properties.” It is at least 12 not counting the land in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

The rationale for his purchases Belogour said was primarily conservation. “I like to conserve land” Belogour said. “I don't like when land goes into the hands of loggers or developers so any time I could I just buy a parcel of land.” But he has also set up several businesses including a brewery called Vermont Beer Makers a syrup vending website called VermontMapleSyrup.com and an incubator called the Vermont Innovation Box which aims to workshop local start-ups though none has joined so far.

But Belogour’s magnum opus is his “Viking Village” which he has been constructing on a parcel of his Guilford property. The themed tourist destination slated to open this summer will be equipped with Nordic cabins a communal “mess hall” ATV tours dog-sledding and historical reenactors who will perform traditional ceremonies and staged Viking combat. “I have been approached now by pretty much every Viking organization in major cities” Belogour said. “I didn’t know anything about the Viking followers in the U.S.—huge!”

“ Belogour initially guessed he owned ‘seven or eight properties in Vermont’ then adjusted it to ‘eight or 10 properties.’ It is at least 12. ”

There is little historical evidence to suggest Vikings who did settle in North America in the early 10th century ever descended far into what is now the United States. But that doesn’t bother Belogour. “The Vikings were not in Vermont? That’s fake news” he said. “Let me tell you the truth: Vikings technically were the first Europeans that encountered Northern America in what we call Newfoundland. They stayed there for about three to five years and then they disappeared. Well where did they go? We found them in Guilford Vermont.”

For a successful financier there is relatively little information about Belogour on the internet. A Nexis news search for his name primarily turns up real estate listings and a handful of articles from 1996 when as an economics student at Northeastern University Belogour was awarded his own patent for developing a shock absorber for roller skates. On YouTube his name turns up footage from a defunct annual fashion show called “Miss UniTrader” which convened in China to debut according to one caption “the most beautiful Ukrainian girls.”

A local reporter in Brattleboro who declined to be named due to the investor’s newfound influence in regional journalism described searching his name on a records database. “Nothing. It's like he’s wiped his entire—it’s like he’s opted out of everything” the reporter said. “You search for ‘Paul Belogour’ and you get what looks like a very curated reputation or sanitized search history.”

According to Belogour’s LinkedIn he entered the foreign exchange industry shortly after college working at the Bank of Boston for six years before establishing his first forex firm. “It’s the largest market in the world a daily volume of $7 trillion dollars—it’s captivating” Belogour told The Daily Beast of the appeal. “That’s what drives the world: foreign exchange.”

Belogour sold his company in 2004 but continued working there until the 2008 recession. Around that time the trader and his wife left the Boston area for their farm just south of Vermont’s border. There he began developing a trading software called UniTrader and opened a second forex company Boston Merchant Financial Ltd or BMFN (the “FN” stands for “financial”). Part of the appeal of BMFN according to Forex platform reviews was its leverage: 400:1 meaning a client could invest just $1000 but trade with as much as $400000.

Belogour told The Daily Beast that he sold BMFN five years ago declining to name its new owner. But his time at BMFN was fraught with legal challenges from regulators and competitors. Between 2012 and 2015 BMFN faced three federal lawsuits—detailed in court records and a robust investigation from the nonprofit outlet VTDigger.

Two of the lawsuits alleged that BMFN had refused to let them withdraw funds while a third claimed Belogour had conspired to steal trade secrets. Of the former one settled out of court for an undisclosed sum; the other was dismissed after a judge determined its jurisdiction should not have been the United States but Switzerland. The latter suit was dismissed by a judge after the plaintiff acquired a stake in Belogour’s software company.

“ There is little historical evidence to suggest Vikings ever descended far into what is now the United States. But that doesn’t bother Belogour. ‘The Vikings were not in Vermont? That’s fake news’ he said. ”

The company has also encountered conflict outside of court. There’s a Facebook group with several dozen members called “BMFN victims” where users list complaints of wrongfully frozen funds and missing investments. A search for “BMFN” on Forex review websites turns up myriad forum discussions detailing similar complaints. Of the allegations Belogour told The Daily Beast: “A lot of people have complaints. Some reasons are valid some not valid” he said. “I don’t know. I’m not aware of any of the people that have issues.”

Though Belogour insists he cut ties with BMFN business filings show that he continues to operate an LLC out of Massachusetts by the same name. Corporate records filed in Massachusetts indicate that the entity was established in 2016 and remains active. The most recent annual report was filed in January. In fact many of Belogour’s more recent property purchases list “BMFN LLC” on the deeds.

Belogour also continued to list BMFN as a current workplace on LinkedIn and in his corporate bio on websites for his other companies. He also confirmed to The Daily Beast that he uses a BMFN email address. Asked about his LinkedIn profile Belogour said: “Yes I don’t know I have a lot of companies on LinkedIn… The way I look at LinkedIn the way I present information is where I work. So if LinkedIn says this is where I’m working so be it.”

Many Vermonters are less concerned with how Belogour made his money than excited by what he has done with it since. Belogour’s supporters applaud his efforts to refurbish historical buildings and conserve woodland that might be otherwise plundered by industry. Many of the properties Belogour bought had been undervalued Brattleboro Selectboard member Tim Wessel said. The marina for example had been on the market since the death of its owner at a fairly low price. And for years the outlet center a no-frills former handbag factory had languished on the outskirts of town—the first building visible to travelers driving up from Massachusetts.

“It’s literally the first building when you get off Exit 1” Wessel said. “And since the mid 1990s it has just looked terrible. But he’s fixing up rather nicely.”

Other boosters tout Belogour’s significant effort to hire locally—nearly all of the contractors he’s hired to renovate the properties have come from the nearby towns. “He was sort of generating this entire economy around him hiring guys to come and build out his village” one Brattleboro resident said.

By Belogour’s account this trend will extend to the newspapers as well: he plans to hire more reporters at the papers. In an op-ed for the Reformer Belogour underscored his belief in the free press promising that the newspapers would operate with total editorial freedom. “I’m reinvesting” Belogour told The Daily Beast. “We will definitely be injecting more money into these publications.”

“Until there’s some evidence of a Bond villain status I don’t think it’s fair to throw him under the bus” Wessel said. “But he’s got that deep accent and he says funny things. I told him ‘You know you’ve been getting beat up on social media.’ And he said in that Arnold Schwarzenegger voice ‘Listen: I don’t care.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,

More than half a century later what is now Bristol Myers Squibb was responsible for Ireland’s second-largest foreign direct investment (FDI) in life sciences when it built its $900m (€760m) biologic drug facility in Cruiserath near Blanchardstown.

The US pharmaceutical behemoth is not alone — Ireland is awash with the world’s largest drug giants. The country is a global hub for pharma and medtech hosting 24 of the top 25 players including Pfizer Johnson & Johnson Roche Novartis and AbbVie.

The latest trade numbers from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) show the value of pharma exports rocketed by 25pc to €62bn last year. Irish-made pharma goods now account for 39pc of all goods exports from the State in 2020.

The pharma giants have been ramping up production as demand for medicines and products connected with the treatment of Covid-19 soars ever higher.

According to the IDA around €2bn is invested in biopharma research and development by IDA client companies annually with an additional €1bn in capital expenditure added each year.

The State agency responsible for attracting inward investment claims that Ireland has one of the “youngest and most highly educated populations in Europe”.

“This provides a rich and strong pool of talent for the sector which continues to benefit from high levels of investment in third-level education and the growth of collaborative clusters” the IDA says on its website.

Ireland’s universities in the fields of engineering chemistry biochemistry and biotechnology have strong co-operative links with the sector.

The IDA has said feedback from the industry in terms of its skills needs feeds directly into the universities and drives Ireland’s pursuit of “biopharmaceutical academic excellence”. According to the IPHA the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association the sector has grown significantly since Ireland joined the then Common Market in 1973. Back then the sector employed less than 2000 people and exports amounted to less than €100m per annum. Now the sector employs over 24500 people directly with an equivalent number employed providing services to it.

Bernard Mallee the director of communications at the IPHA said the Irish sector was a good employer as it is so “globally connected”.

“Ireland is part of that network of global manufacturing and production” he said. “Pharmaceutical companies are extremely well structured; they have lots of very dynamic internal processes and are very professionalised operations and offer lots of opportunities to grow as an employee through the ranks to get the extra skills and exposure to the latest thinking in science.

“I think all of those things are really good indicators for employee and career prospects.”

Mallee said the sector is in a good shape in Ireland and its value to the economy has heightened its recognition.

“The kind of economic buoyancy this industry brings to the country at a time when much of the domestic economy is struggling is really clear.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmlsYW5kLmllL2Zhcm1pbmctbmV3cy9hcmxlcy1wdXBpbHMtd2lubmluZy1wcm9qZWN0LWFpbXMtdG8taGVscC1saXZlc3RvY2stZmFybWVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arles pupils' winning project aims to help livestock farmers,"Pupils from Arles National School (NS) Co. Laois have been awarded Engineers Ireland’s STEPS Young Engineers Award for their ‘Smart Windmill’ project which aims to help livestock farmers harness clean wind energy to heat water – making their daily work easier.

The ‘Windtastic Windmills’ team comprised: Rosie Rogers Patrick O’Neill Beckie Kennedy Rían Murphy and Grace Kelly from third and fourth class. They came up with their winning project idea having noticed the amount of work their parents and local farmers have to do on livestock farms.

‘Smart Windmill’

The Arles N.S. team set about developing a ‘Smart Windmill’ to heat water using green energy to help give farmers quick access to hot water to generate heat for heat mats needed by newborn piglets and for the sterilisation of milking machines and bulk tanks.

By creating an efficient and sustainable hot water system the pupils said that their innovation will give farmers more free time.

“Our project took us about three or four weeks to design build and test. We had to change some of the materials in our prototype because they didn’t work with the water but we kept trying and finally got the formula right.”

The Arles NS students faced stiff competition from 169 schools from across Ireland. Over 600 projects were submitted to this year’s STEPS Young Engineers Award which is coordinated by Engineers Ireland’s STEPS programme funded by Science Foundation Ireland; the Department of Education and Skills; and industry leaders ARUP ESB Intel and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).

The judges said that the Arles NS project was a well thought-through solution to a problem that directly affected the pupils’ community and their family lives. The project they said showed all the aspects of great engineering from conception to completion.

The pupils produced a clear engineering design drawing and identified challenges like choosing materials and produced an exceptional prototype of their solution the adjudicators said.

The engineering report showed that the Windtastic Windmills team had excellent engineering aptitude at a young age.

Principal of Arles NS Annette Fitzpatrick said: “Arles NS is a rural school and we are very proud to be a small school with big achievements.”

Winning the STEPS Young Engineer award for a second consecutive year is she said a testament to the profound importance placed on STEM education in the school.

“We recognise that the skills the children develop from a STEM education extend far beyond the classroom.

“We have a strong culture of fostering scientific thinking and exploration in Arles NS. Our teachers strive to provide creative learning opportunities which encourage children to work collaboratively to become problem-solvers and critical thinkers. In essence we are educating the innovators of tomorrow.

“Working on the STEPS Young Engineers Award enabled the children to think of innovative ways to find solutions to problems in their local community and allowed us as educators to see the locality through the eyes of a child.

“It was a wonderful experience for the whole school community to be involved in this national project. We look forward to many further successful years of inspiring the young accomplished engineers of Arles NS” she said.

STEPS Young Engineers Award

Now in its third year the nationwide primary school competition encourages third and fourth class pupils and their teachers to explore the world of engineering by developing an engineering project that would help to improve their local community.

Last year pupils from Ms. Holohan’s class developed an accessible and inclusive playground.

Every project team was recognised at the virtual awards ceremony on Engineers Ireland’s website and YouTube Channel which included an engineering spectacular show by Mark Langtry head of science and sport at Explorium Ireland’s national sport and science centre.

Also recognised at the virtual awards ceremony was Aidan Kenny aged two from Creagh Ballinasloe. Aidan who is facing a difficult illness was honoured with an individual STEPS Young Engineers Award in recognition of his curious mind and bravery.

Caroline Spillane director general of Engineers Ireland said that a high calibre of entries was submitted by third and fourth class pupils for this year’s STEPS Young Engineers Award.

“We were so pleased to see such a high level of creative and innovative projects. It is my hope that each of the students who participated in this year’s STEPS Young Engineers Award thoroughly enjoyed this experience.

“I hope they will be encouraged to continue their exploration of the exciting world of engineering into the future and explore the limitless opportunities a career in the engineering sector can offer.”

The director general also extended congratulations to Aidan Kenny and his family on his achievement of an individual STEPS Young Engineers Award.

She praised all the volunteer engineers who visited schools virtually to assist students with their projects. “At Engineers Ireland our volunteers are the lifeblood of our organisation and we are incredibly grateful to our volunteer engineers who visited schools to help students with their projects.”

Caroline also paid tribute to the volunteers from Bristol-Myers Squibb; Intel; Tandem and Jacobs Engineering who assisted with the judging process.

Margie McCarthy head of education and public engagement at Science Foundation Ireland congratulated all the third and fourth class pupils teachers and volunteers who participated in this year’s STEPS Young Engineers Award competition.

“Today’s primary school students will soon become tomorrow’s innovative leaders creative thinkers and problem solvers.

“We are proud to support this award as it strives to empower students to create solutions for their local community by exploring STEM subjects and using their creative and critical thinking skills” she concluded.",,,,,,

By the time he left Conway via the transfer portal he’d made a significant impact for the Chanticleers: 108 catches for 1534 yards and 11 touchdowns. That’s in addition to 35 carries for 439 yards and two more scores.

After the 2023 season wrapped Brown was ready to take his game to the top level of college football in the Southeastern Conference. He turned down scholarships from Auburn Louisville and others in favor of heading to Columbia.

“I came here to be a complete receiver” Brown said during a recent appearance on The Garnet Trust Hour.

Brown arrived in January going through winter workouts before spring ball got ramped up. Once practice began Shane Beamer and his staff made the decision to shift Brown from an exclusive slot player to an outside receiver.

He’s enjoyed the transition so far.

“I feel like if I can play inside and outside that’ll be better for me. I would say the big difference for me is having somebody in front of you the whole game. I’m not really used to that. I’m used to free access” he explained.

Playing outside has also opened up more route options for Brown who had identified his route running as an area that he wanted to improve after last season.

“That’s really one thing that I need to work on” said Brown. “Like at Coastal we were in a triple option offense so I wasn’t really running routes like that. One thing I’m really going to harp on this summer is the route tree and the mental aspect of the game.”

Brown noted that the competition level – facing off against guys like OD Fortune Judge Collier and other South Carolina defensive backs this spring – is making him better.

“I love to compete. I go against OD every day and OD really opened my eyes. I was like this is what I’ve got. I feel like Judge is really going to make me take that next step. Judge likes to put his hands on you and Judge is long so just going against him and getting one-on-one reps those are going to help me. It’s going to translate to the game the stuff I do in practice.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvd2hhdHMta2lsbGluZy1zb3V0aGVybi1jYWxpZm9ybmlhcy1icm93bi1wZWxpY2FuLXBvcHVsYXRpb24vMzQwOTAwMC_SAXNodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNsb3NhbmdlbGVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3doYXRzLWtpbGxpbmctc291dGhlcm4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYXMtYnJvd24tcGVsaWNhbi1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLzM0MDkwMDAvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's killing Southern California's brown pelican population?,"It’s a mystery that remains unsolved.

After the emaciated dying birds started showing up on beaches from Orange County to Malibu several weeks ago there are now indications that their young are being affected too.

Biologists who study pelican populations on Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands off the Ventura coast say that pelican chicks are being found dead in their nests there according to Debbie McGuire executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach.

“Either something happened to the parents that couldn’t keep feeding them or the parent just wasn’t able to forage and catch enough fish to keep themselves alive” McGuire said.

The National Park Service website says that “the only long-term breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in the United States” are on the islands.

The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center which has an on-site veterinarian has seen a huge increase in pelicans being brought in for treatment according to McGuire. At present the center has treated 186 patients total with only half of those surviving.

Other marine wildlife care centers are reporting similar numbers with many birds suffering from ""emaciation dehydration malnutrition anemia"" according to Elizabeth Wood a veterinarian with the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center.

“We know they’re starving but we don’t know why” Wood said.

McGuire said there are number of theories being considered since no pathogens have been discovered so far from necropsies performed on the dead birds. Among them: food sources such as bait fish that have been swimming out of reach of the pelicans which typically only dive to a maximum of 6 feet when hunting.

But why the bait fish are doing that is still unclear McGuire said.

Anyone who encounters a starving pelican is urged to report it to authorities or a marine animal rescue organization immediately said Wood because it probably has less than two hours to live.

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

View image in fullscreen Sugar production has an ugly past with roots in slavery and abhorrent working conditions into the present. Photograph: Ethan Frisch

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY29va2luZy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS9yZWNpcGVzLzEwMjU0MDktYnJvd24tc3VnYXItc2hlZXQtcGFuLWZyZW5jaC10b2FzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Sugar Sheet-Pan French Toast Recipe,With a cracking caramelized brown sugar crust topping and soft custardy slices of challah this sheet-pan French toast is sweet perfection all by itself without the need for maple syrup or powdered sugar.

A unique course for designing integrated semiconductor chips conceived and organized by Gayathri Singh team leader for Microelectronics at CMC Microsystems is a hot ticket with graduate students at Canadian universities. No other organization in Canada offers such a course based on the most advanced semiconductor chip processes in existence.

The May 10 to May 21 (2021) online event is fully subscribed with 30 university researchers and graduate students across Canada taking part.

Commenting on how she designed the course Dr. Singh said: “I wanted to base the content on leading edge semiconductor technology. It is exciting and gratifying to see the interest in the program. I am most grateful to our industrial partners who joined together to provide vital support to the program” she said.

Dr. Singh earned her Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from Queen’s University. She worked as Senior Component Design Engineer at Intel India at their Bangalore Design Center between 2005 and 2008. This advanced course trains students and researchers in the Analog-Mixed Signal Design Methodology using Cadence tools which target the GlobalFoundries GF12LP FinFET / PDK (Process Design Kit).

FinFET transistors are key components

The training content and material for the course was developed by Cadence Design Systems Canada Ltd. Skills learned are consistent with those of engineers designing chips at top flight technology companies in Canada including AMD Alphawave IP and StarIC.

Participants. must have had prior experience with semiconductor chip design and familiarity with state-of-the-art design tools. Participants which include CMC staff members learn about one of the most advanced semiconductor chip processes in North America. The FinFET transistors are key components right down to 2nm process nodes in development in the world’s most advanced fabrication facilities. Actual fabrication of the chip designs created by participants will be done through GlobalFoundries facilitated by CMC.

Skills learned contribute to the overall knowledge

Participants will be submitting design proposals in the fall of 2021 that will be reviewed by experts. Another workshop style session is planned for the winter next year before these designs are taped out so designers can consult with experts from Cadence companies and academe prior to submitting their designs for fabrication.

CMC Microsystems enables industry relevant technology research at 60 post-secondary institutions across Canada. CMC programs and services provide researchers with access and training throughout the integrated chip design life cycle from software design through actual manufacturing and testing of silicon chips. The skills learned in this course contribute to the overall knowledge and training of university graduates in semiconductor related technologies. The knowledge and skills are highly relevant and desirable to industry.

According to Marie Thiele director of common services for CMC the game plan is to open the program more widely in the future. “Our training platform is especially valuable in times of virtual training bringing together participants from across Canada suppliers from other countries and CMC employees onto our secure design tools and training” said Thiele.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It looks as though harness racing in Florida is soon to be dead. A bill that will decouple – free the track owner from having to hold and subsidize horse races – Pompano Park has now passed the legislature and awaits the governor’s signature. Harness Link put it succinctly: “[This bill] will most likely end pari-mutuel harness racing in the state of Florida thus bringing an end to Pompano Park after 57 year of harness racing.” In other words Florida harness people the jig is up. Your (lucrative) spigot – gaming revenue that should have been going back to the state for education and the like – has been cut off. And that my friends is progress. Now on to the Thoroughbreds.

(The SunSentinel says that a redevelopment plan from Pompano’s owner Caesars Entertainment “calls for transforming the Pompano Park property into an upscale retail dining office and entertainment hub.” Now doesn’t that sound a mite better than a dirty seedy racetrack that abuses and kills horses?)

Read more

Two months ago Tom Kline and Shanin Specter decided to require all 150 employees of their Center City law firm to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

All but seven employees ― those who received medical or religious exemptions — have since been vaccinated and the firm is bringing everyone back to the office at 16th and Locust Streets in Philadelphia on June 1 said Shanin Specter who cofounded Kline & Specter PC. The unvaccinated group will work in a separate space in the building.

Specter would like to see other companies not just health-care employers like the University of Pennsylvania Health System do the same thing. “If every employer took the position that we’ve taken we would be a lot further along on getting past this pandemic” he said.

Penn Health this week was the first major Philadelphia employer to announce that it was requiring employees to be vaccinated unless they had a medical or religious reason not to. But Specter and others said it was not surprising that a health-care provider would do so given that its employees have so much contact with sick and vulnerable people.

After Penn Health’s announcement The Inquirer found that numerous large employers in the region — including Campbell Soup Co.  Cooper University Health Care Independence Blue Cross Rivers Casino Temple University Health System Vanguard Group Wawa and Wells Fargo — were encouraging but not requiring employees to be vaccinated.

The heads of two major business groups the New Jersey Business & Industry Association and the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry said Friday that their members were sticking to encouragement.

Part of it is cultural said Michele Siekerka president and chief executive of the New Jersey business group. Owners don’t feel comfortable requiring it she said. “They are going to highly encourage their employees. Some many even provide incentives time off to go get the vaccine a bonus day off something like that” she said.

Firing people if they don’t get the vaccine is out of the question Siekerka said. “We have a hiring crisis across the board” she said referring to the inability of many businesses to find employees.

Gene Barr president of the Pennsylvania chamber said he understood why health-care employers might require the vaccine but said he was a bit surprised to hear that a law firm would do so. Still he said he understood the impulse to make sure employees feel safe by requiring everyone to be vaccinated.

In this region according to federal health figures 44% of the Pennsylvania population has yet to receive a single vaccine shot. The equivalent figure is 43% in New Jersey and 49% in Delaware.

At Kline & Specter with all but seven employees vaccinated the firm is plunging fully back into office work. “We are not offering remote working” Specter said.

Vaccinated employees have to prove their status by showing their COVID-19 vaccination record card with the CDC logo.

Specter is convinced the medical malpractice and personal injury firm will be more productive when it returns to working together in the office.

He also cited a benefit to the Center City economy as a bonus especially if more businesses follow Kline & Specter’s lead in returning to the office.

“There are a lot of small businesses who are dependent on our law firm and other employers in the neighborhood for their economic survival” Specter said. “We’re going to have our people back to work and that means something good for Schlesinger’s Deli two doors away for the clothing store across the street for the pizza place across the street.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvb2RzdG93bi1zYWxlbS1jb3VudHktbmV3LWplcnNleS13YXJlaG91c2Utc2F5aW5ncy0yMDIxMDUyMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Salem County sayings from a bygone era adorn aging warehouse walls mixing business and reading pleasure,"Quotes on the side a of a warehouse in Woodstown Salem County N.J. Bromides from another era grace the walls of working warehouses offering advice and good feeling. Read more

In Woodstown Salem County the old walls of a cluster of seven working warehouses display even older sayings — bromides from another time bracketed in quotes and rendered in calligraphic elegance.

The now-fading messages painted in black letters on white walls convey homey sentiments existential meditations and corny aphorisms that passed for social media in the mid-20th century:

“Keep your face to the sunshine and you will not see shadows.”

“The greatest the most important of the arts is living.”

“In quarreling the truth is always lost.”

As pandemic protocols loosen and the coming Memorial Day weekend signals the start of summer travel season the walls will serve as a little-known roadside attraction for beach-bound motorists using back roads — in this case N.J. Route 45 south — to roll through bucolic Woodstown toward the Atlantic Ocean about 50 miles east.

“The walls used to be more of a landmark but then many of the letters started disappearing over the past 30 years” said Michael Vassaras 59 a forklift driver for CPS Distribution a freezer warehouse that operates four of the buildings. “Still the walls are the only thing outsiders know about Woodstown other than Cowtown Rodeo” which as Vassaras may hate to hear is technically in adjacent Pilesgrove.

Vassaras said his favorite wall-displayed phrase includes the line “The steam that blows the whistle never turns the wheel.”

” There’s deep truth in that said Vassaras a working man all his life “because the noisemakers of the world don’t really work.”

According to Vassaras’ boss John Ober president and owner of CPS the idea of mixing business with reading pleasure originated with a local entrepreneur and larger-than-life fellow named Earl Erdner who died in 1986 at age 78.

Beginning in the 1940s Erdner had 22 such buildings many called canhouses built throughout the county several of them adorned with adages according to Ober.

Erdner who once won a farm in a card game was a triple-married bon vivant who favored Cadillacs collected replicas of elephants (trunks facing upward only) and threw lavish Christmas parties for his employees according to people who knew him. He was director of the Woodstown National Bank and in 1949 was elected to a single term as mayor of Swedesboro Gloucester County.

But Erdner’s main job was as an agricultural broker who would contract with farmers in the area to grow crops such as carrots or asparagus which he would store in one of his warehouses. He’d then sell the produce to Campbell Soup Co. Green Giant or other large food companies said Ober who personally knew Erdner.

For companies such as Del Monte Foods and Heinz Erdner would store many of their cans of vegetables to later be sold — hence the “canhouse” label on some of the buildings said Erdner’s son Larry 86 who lives in Pilesgrove.

It was Erdner’s idea to emblazon his warehouses with the profundities of his time Ober said. “I asked him ‘Earl where’d you get those sayings?’ He said people gave them to him. His rule was ‘If you do business with me and hand me a saying I’ll just put it on the wall.’”

Larry said his father assigned an art teacher from Bridgeton Cumberland County to paint the maxims on the buildings every summer. “It was a full-time job and he’d keep coming back to repaint them” Larry said.

Ober said he’s tried to maintain the old chestnuts in their original condition but “it costs a fortune to go over every letter with black paint.”

Most of the Erdner pearls in the Woodstown grouping are exhibited on three buildings operated by Helena Agri-Enterprises an outfit that helps farmers improve productivity.

While the dictums are products of a bygone era the idea of roadside messaging hasn’t gone out of style.

Throughout the country eager communicators use signs and billboards to attract attention or to merely amuse.

Outside a community center in Indian Hills Colo. a volunteer named Vince Rozmiarek places drive-by groaners on an old-fashioned signboard one letter at a time: “Due to the quarantine I’ll only be doing inside jokes.”

“My mood ring is missing and I don’t know how to feel about that.”

“I call my horse Mayo and sometimes Mayo neighs.”

Communication aimed at travelers has deep American roots as evidenced by the Mail Pouch tobacco ads painted on the sides of road-facing barns across 22 states for more than 100 years (1891 to 1992) including in Morris County N.J. and Erie County Pa.

And drivers from 1925 through 1963 used to speed-read Burma-Shave signs along the highway so iconic they’re part of the Smithsonian Institution: “Does your husband / Misbehave / Grunt and grumble / Rant and rave / Shoot the brute some / Burma-Shave.”

So far the Smithsonian hasn’t come calling to preserve the fast-vanishing witticisms left out in the Woodstown weather. Neither have any universities corporations or arts organizations stepped up.

“I’ve been thinking about that” said Vassaras. “I wish they would have kept it up. It was a good look.

“And people could have kept saying ‘Woodstown yeah. That’s the place where the sayings are.’”",,,,,,,,,

The store exclusive to Amex cardholders offers concessions and merchandise to help fans avoid long lines and get back to the action faster. The store is a partnership between Amex and the sports arena to keep fans safe from COVID-19.

The shop features a variety of food and beverage concession items along with unique locally sourced items from Brooklyn small businesses and of course select merchandise items usually found in the Brooklyn Nets Team Store. The shop is on the Barclay Center's main concourse outside of section 6 next to the American Express Card Member Entrance.

According to the American Express Trendex: Experiences Survey nearly two-thirds of live-entertainment consumers agree that because of COVID-19 contactless payment options have never been more important to them. And 70% say that having a contactless payment option available would make them feel more comfortable returning to live sports music and entertainment events.

Card members can tap their contactless Amex card mobile wallet or insert their card to enter the shop. There may be a $1.00 hold on the card which will be updated after purchases are completed. Technology tracks movements in the store with each item having a unique weight that is tracked through weight-sensitive shelf sensors.

If an item is replaced on an incorrect shelf the system will identify that the item was moved -- but not purchased -- and the inventory report will alert the store operator that an item is in the wrong location. In-store staff are available to monitor any issues that may arise.

After making a purchase cardholders can see their receipts at Go.Amex/Bkshop. You'll need to enter the last four digits of your physical card or digital wallet four-digit tail number along with the date and approximate time of purchase. All sales are final due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An American Express spokeswoman notes that it is focused on launching the American Express Shop at Barclays Center so there are no plans at this time to expand in additional locations.

The new dealerships will capitalize on a ""red hot"" market for the auto industry. While the pandemic was devastating for many industries especially restaurants bars and brick and mortar retail dealerships thrived once they were allowed to reopen dealers said.

""I think right when the pandemic started like most retailers things were challenging"" CarMax Regional Vice President Joe Holder said. ""But it's been absolutely on fire since probably six or seven months ago now.""

Masks and businesses:After new CDC guidance some Polk County businesses shift mask rules. Others don't

Unemployment:Polk County sees slight uptick in unemployment economist says numbers are optimistic

By the end of June Lakeland will host three brand new car dealerships which have each been in the works for a few years. Each site went under construction in 2020 when the pandemic was raging vaccines were not yet widely available and the future was far less clear. But employees with the dealers said the pandemic was an overall boost - not a hindrance - to the industry paving the way for these new car shopping sites.

Where can I snag a new car?

First up for Lakeland is a new CarMax dealership at 3223 US Highway 98 North. Just off of I-4 Polk County's first CarMax is set to open on Wednesday May 26.

Holder said the Lakeland location is the 22nd store in Florida and one of three Florida stores set to open this fiscal year. He said Lakeland was chosen to host the new site because there's a ""tremendous customer base"" in Florida but an ""underserved market"" for CarMax between Tampa and Orlando. Additionally CarMax is excited about the chosen site because of its proximity to two major highways.

The new CarMax has been under construction since November of 2020 Holder said. When it opens it will be 7590 square feet and is modeled off CarMax's most recently opened locations. It's the smallest of the three dealerships heading to Lakeland.

Holder said that although over 90% of CarMax purchases start online with online appraisals for vehicles or financing customers are still interested in visiting physical locations.

""They still want to come to the store"" Holder said. ""They want to see multiple cars in person they want to test drive they want to talk to someone.""

Lakeland will be CarMax's second store opening since the onset of COVID-19 last spring. Holder said although there was a strategic pause on openings because of the pandemic the company now welcomes new stores. Ten are set to open this fiscal year two of which are also in Florida.

""It's the right time to get out there and expand as a growing company"" Holder said.

The Lakeland CarMax will have 20 employees.

After CarMax Lakeland will welcome a new Jaguar Land Rover dealership owned by Elder Automative Group at 2550 Interstate Drive. Robert Elder one of the owners said the dealership is set to open on June 10.

The location was favored by Jaguar Land Rover Elder said because Lakeland is a ""growing community"" in close proximity to Tampa. The site has been in the works for three years and under construction for nine months. It's set to be 29000 square feet.

Labor shortage:Maya Lora: Polk County is facing a major labor shortage. Is unemployment really to blame?

Elder said the facility is a ""design marvel"" and will feature several modern amenities including a separate car delivery room where customers can take a virtual tour of their new vehicle and explore all of the new features they now have access to.

The new Jaguar Land Rover will have both new and used cars for sale. Elder expects to have about 150-200 cars on the lot when full though the entire auto industry is experiencing an inventory shortage as a result of both manufacturing delays and increased demand for vehicles.

Elder Automative Group owns two other dealerships in Hillsborough County and four dealerships in Michigan. Elder said Florida was the easier state to deal with during the pandemic as it was much more ""open"" for business throughout.

""Florida didn't have these stringent rules"" Elder said. ""Sales were much much higher in Florida.""

Elder said he is currently hiring for the new dealership which will have 60 employees when fully staffed.

Lastly Lakeland's Mazda dealership currently located at 1250 W. Memorial Blvd. is making a move to South Lakeland.

Development:Lakeland developer wants to put nearly 200 homes on 56 acres of land. Will the city allow it?

Potential and current Mazda customers will be able to start visiting 4317 US Highway 98 S towards the end of June said General Manager Sophia Justiz. Once the new location opens the old one will close she added.

The new Mazda site has been in the works for three years when the current one was bought by Holler-Classic Automotive Group in July 2018. Justiz said Mazda has ""outgrown this area outgrown this lot"" and the new dealership will be easier for customers from Winter Haven Sebring Bartow and Lakeland to access because it's more centrally located.

""We are the only Mazda dealer in Polk County so the next closest is really either Orlando or Brandon"" Justiz said. ""We do have a big market to service.""

The new store will be 24000 square feet and sport a fully air-conditioned workshop which Justiz said is a huge deal for technicians working in the brutal Florida heat. The ""state of the art"" facility will also have outdoor seating for customers a feature that's unique for car dealerships but Justiz said was added as a COVID-19 precaution.

The modern design and feel of the dealership is a reflection of Mazda's desire to compete with a more ""premium market"" Justiz said. She cited Infinity Acura and Lexus as new brand competitors for Mazda vehicles.

""The cars are already premium"" Justiz said. ""Now we need premium stores and premium service.""

Opinion:Your Money: What the American Jobs Plan means for investors

One of those premium services is the ability to take one of the ""fleet"" vehicles out for the day while your car is in the shop Justiz said.

At the current Mazda location there are 180 new cars and about 40 pre-owned cars. At the new dealership Justiz expects to have about 220 new cars and 60 used cars. To handle the larger space and inventory she expects to hire between 10 and 15 new employees.

Auto market sees pandemic spike

Despite COVID-19 the auto market didn't have a bad year.

""CarMax has been operating since 1993 so almost 28 years and we had our best March we've ever had nationwide"" Holder said.

Of course there's been issues. A nationwide chip shortage for car computers has led to a slowdown in inventory one dealers are still coping with. And towards the beginning of the pandemic when everything was shut down it wasn't looking pretty.

""It started off very scary in March in April of last year"" Elder said. ""And then it came back very strong and the market has been fantastic.""

Like other businesses dealers had to make major adjustments such as requiring employees and customers to mask up and installing plexiglass barriers and six-foot social distancing markers. But expansion still flourished.

When the new Jaguar Land Rover went under construction nine months ago the outlook for the pandemic was far less optimistic. But Elder and the other dealership owners plowed forward.

""We believe in Polk County and we believe in Lakeland. And we just thought that although the pandemic was a huge huge stoppage to our business we thought it would be just a hiccup"" Elder said. ""We knew that America and Polk County and Lakeland would continue to go forward. We really didn't think about any of that as a crisis.""

Those within the automotive industry had a few reasons for the uptick in business including the influx of cash from stimulus checks and tax returns people being ready to return to the world after being pent up in their homes and seeing less travel restrictions with cars and the fact that dealerships were open for business while many other brick and mortar sites were shuttered.

""We've actually done pretty well. I mean service service slowed down quite a bit because people weren't driving as much"" Justiz said. ""But sales did fine throughout the whole Covid pandemic to be honest. I think a lot of people with so many shops closed and dealers still open it was one of the few things that you could actually still buy.""

But as the days went on the crowds started to grow. The president of the fair said it was the best decision they made.

""It was a gamble for us to take on this endeavor"" said Vickie Chouris South Florida Fair president & CEO. ""The South Florida Fair community the people in our area they really came. They supported. They enjoyed.""

Chouris said the South Florida Fair is vital for the local economy.

Miami carnival were given the green light to advance planning for the 2021 celebrations.

For more than a year physical carnivals throughout the world were cancelled because of the covid19 pandemic.Some Carnivals adapted and held virtual-type carnivals instead of the physical festival. However with vaccinations happening rapidly around the world and places and sectors cautiously reopening one carnival committee is getting ready to host the festival again.

At the time of writing the US had fully vaccinated 38.6 per cent of its population according to ourworldindata.org. In a media release the Miami Broward One Carnival Host Committee (MBOCHC) and the South Florida Carnival Bandleaders Association announced that the 37th annual Miami Carnival Cultural festival will be hosted on Columbus Day Weekend. The US' Columbus Day will be on October 11.

The release said the producers of Miami carnival were given the green light to advance planning for the 2021 celebrations after working with county medical and park department officials in Miami-Dade and Broward County. ""With guest safety as the highest priority the Miami Broward Carnival One Host Committee (MBOCHC) will promote and implement an event plan of reduced capacity in adherence with recommended CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) covid guidelines.

""As local covid19 positivity rates continue to decline from the increased per cent of vaccinated persons Miami Carnival may be permitted to increase attendance capacity and relax specific protocols"" the release said. It quoted MBOCHC chair Joan Hinkson-Justin as saying that the committee was excited to be able to host Miami carnival in person again. ""We have missed being able to present our pageantry music and Caribbean culture with everyone.

Our committee has been diligently working with both Miami -Dade and Broward counties to ensure that we can plan our cultural event with the health and safety of our stakeholders and patrons as a key part of that plan"" she said.

The South Florida Carnival Band Leaders Association also said it was pleased to once again work with the MBOCHC to plan ""a safe and well-desired carnival."" The 2021 Miami Carnival Showcase will take place on June 5. Vienna Carnival was one physical Carnival held last year.

Checks on the West Indian American Day Carnival Association's (WIADCA) website showed that there was no statement as to whether or not there would be a Labour Day Parade this year. It was held virtually last year and is expected to be held on September 6."

Wednesday 19 May 2021 saw a historic moment in Britain's carrier renaissance as HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales met at sea for the first time.

Following the conclusion of Exercise Strike Warrior the UK’s two new Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales sailed together at sea for the first time as the former returned to Portsmouth.

With two 65000 tonne carriers in operational service Britain has a continuous carrier strike capability with one vessel always ready to respond to global events at short notice.

“Having previously commanded both HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales it was hugely exciting to be present as the two met at sea for the first time. I know that sense of pride and accomplishment is shared by thousands of others military and civilian who have contributed to the Royal Navy’s carrier renaissance over the past decade or more. The strategic significance is profound. Building one aircraft carrier is a sign of national ambition. But building two – and operating them simultaneously – is a sign of serious national intent. It means Britain has a continuous carrier strike capability with one vessel always ready to respond to global events at short notice. Few other navies can do that. Britain is back in the front rank of maritime powers.”



Commodore Steve Moorhouse Commander UK Carrier Strike Group

Strike Warrior saw the Carrier Strike Group pitted against warships from NATO’s Standing Maritime Group 1 to prove it can undertake high-intensity operations in response to a broad range of crisis and conflict situations. Activities included live missile firings at sea training with NATO mine counter measures operations and submarine exercises.

HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Queen Elizabeth pictured at sea for the first time.

HMS Queen Elizabeth is now about to set sail as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21). As well as operating as an aircraft carrier one of the key capabilities of the ship will be able to act as a key focus of command for the CSG21 multi-nation task groups and inter-navy training that will be such a critical feature of 2021 operations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS90LW1vYmlsZS1vbmVwbHVzLTh0LXJlYnJhbmQtd2l0aG91dC1ib290bG9hZGVyLXVubG9ja2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile OnePlus 8T can now be rebranded without unlocking the bootloader,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS90LW1vYmlsZS1vbmVwbHVzLTh0LXJlYnJhbmQtd2l0aG91dC1ib290bG9hZGVyLXVubG9ja2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvbWlsaXRhcnktcmFua2luZy01LWJpZ2dlc3QtbmF2YWwtcG93ZXJzLTIwMzAtMTg1ODc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MILITARY RANKING: 5 Biggest Naval Powers by 2030,"Before the money ran out Moscow had big plans for its navy. If it were to somehow find funding then it could pursue a number of interesting projects.

Here's What You Need to Know: The most powerful navies in 2030 will be a reflection of the broader state of the world. Some countries are invested in preserving the current international order and see naval power as a means to maintain it. Other emerging countries are building navies commensurate with their newfound sense of status often with an eye towards challenging that order.

The eastward shift in naval power will continue in 2030 a product of both declining defense budgets in Europe and growing economies in Asia. While the most powerful navies of the Cold War were concentrated largely in Europe by 2030 both China and India will be on the list with Japan and South Korea as runners-up also fielding large modern naval forces.

Ship-wise there are two classes that will define the most powerful navies: aircraft carriers and ballistic missile submarines. Aircraft carriers reflect the need to maintain a global or even regional power-projection capability. Ballistic-missile submarines reflect a maturation and diversification of a country’s nuclear arsenal with an eye toward maintaining a second-strike capability in case of surprise attack. More than any other type those two will define naval power in the early-to-mid twenty-first century.

The United States

The United States the dominant naval power worldwide in 1945 will continue to dominate the seas eighty-five years later. By 2030 the Navy will be halfway through its thirty-year shipbuilding plan and have built three Ford–class aircraft carriers to begin replacing existing Nimitz-class carriers. Amphibious ship numbers should be slightly higher than current numbers and the first ship in class to replace the Ohio ballistic missile submarines should enter service in 2031.

In surface combatants all three Zumwalt-class cruisers will be in service—assuming the program remains fully funded—and the Navy will have built thirty-three more Arleigh Burke–class destroyers. A next-generation version of the Littoral Combat Ship will enter production in 2030.

Under current plans the U.S. Navy should reach its three-hundred-ship goal between 2019 and 2034 but after that period the number of surface combatants begins to drop. These plans also assume a higher than average shipbuilding budget while at the same time the service must compete with the budget demands of other services—particularly the Air Force—and domestic programs. While U.S. naval superiority isn’t ending anytime soon the period after 2030 will be a critical one.

The United Kingdom

The Royal Navy of 2030 will be paradoxically the smallest and yet most powerful in the history of the United Kingdom. A combination of two new aircraft carriers restoring fixed-wing flight to navy after a forty-year hiatus and a fleet of ballistic-missile submarines will keep a numerically inferior Royal Navy in the top five.

The Royal Navy’s surface fleet currently at nineteen destroyers and frigates will shrink even further to six Type 45 guided-missile destroyers and eight Global Combat Ship frigates. The number of nuclear-powered attack submarines will remain constant at seven.

The Royal Navy is responsible for the UK’s nuclear deterrent and currently operates four Vanguard-class nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines each equipped with sixteen launch tubes for Trident D-5 missiles. The Vanguard-class is expected to be replaced with the Successor class starting in 2028.

The UK’s sea-based power projection capability will be in the form of the Queen Elizabeth–class of aircraft carriers. The two conventionally powered ships Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales will each displace sixty-five thousand tons fully loaded and capable of carrying up to fifty aircraft. Aircraft will include the F-35B Lightning II fighter and Merlin Wildcat Chinook and Apache helicopters. The two carriers will optionally double as amphibious transports capable of carrying up to nine hundred Royal Marines or troops of the Army’s Sixteenth Air Assault Brigade.

China

The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) of 2030 will continue to build on the ground broken by the PLAN of 2016. Currently China has four major ship hulls it seems to be content with: the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Type 054A frigate Type 056 corvette and Type 071 amphibious transport. All four are mature designs in large-scale production that will form the bulk of the fleet in 2030.

By one prediction by 2030 the PLAN will have ninety-nine submarines four aircraft carriers 102 destroyers and frigates twenty-six corvettes seventy-three amphibious ships and 111 missile craft a whopping 415 ships in total to approximately 309 in the U.S. Navy of 2030. This would put China in a solid position as the world’s largest navy by the number of ships—though not by total ship tonnage.

Could China really reach 415 ships? Such a total would probably require twice as many submarines to be produced annually a boost in destroyer production to achieve a net gain as older designs age out and a huge increase in amphibious ships. It would also require two more carriers than are currently in service or under construction. Reaching such a goal would require a substantial increase in the PLAN’s budget—at a time when the Chinese Communist Party is finally applying the brakes to defense budget increases.

Other ships under construction will form China’s fleet in 2030 are the Type 055 destroyer and Type 001A aircraft carrier. A new ballistic-missile submarine to supplement and eventually replace the Type 094 Jin class is also likely. The 094 class is notoriously noisy underwater and not a particularly good place to put a fraction of China’s three hundred or so nuclear warheads.

India

The Indian Navy will be the second (or third if you count Russia) Asian navy on this list. India has recently begun pouring enormous resources into its naval service and as a result by 2030 could have one of the top five navies on the planet.

Barring unforeseen naval developments in other countries by 2030 India will have the second largest carrier fleet in the world with three flattops. If all goes according to plan India should have three aircraft carriers: Vikramaditya Vikrant and Vishal together fielding a total of about 110–120 aircraft.

India will also have at least nine destroyers including two guided missiles of the Kolkata class three of the Delhi class and four of the in-construction Visakhapatnam class. This is one less than what India has at present and the number of hulls will have to increase if India is serious about protecting three aircraft carriers. Roughly two-thirds of the Indian Navy’s frigate fleet is modern enough to make it to 2030 particularly the Shivalik and Talwar classes but India will have to increase the number of frigates overall—especially if Pakistan is serious about putting nuclear weapons on submarines.

India is in the process of standing up a sea-based leg of its nuclear triad with the first ballistic missile submarine Arihant expected to be operational soon. Three Arihant subs are planned and an overall “boomer” fleet of six submarines is expected.

Russia

The combination of a downturn oil prices and Western sanctions from its annexation of Crimea will put a crimp in Russia’s economic stride for the near future. After economic growth of up to six percent annually the bear is in recession with no immediate end in sight. A plan to replace 90 percent of Russian military equipment including ships and naval equipment has stalled.

By 2030 Russia’s position on this list will be in large part due to its ballistic missile submarine fleet. Eight Borei submarines each carrying twenty Bulava missiles will be in service forming the second-largest ballistic-missile submarine fleet in the world.

The rest of the Russian Navy is slouching toward oblivion with a dwindling number of large surface combatants submarines and a single decrepit aircraft carrier. Yet there’s still hope: before the money ran out Moscow had big plans for its navy and if were to somehow find funding a number of interesting projects could be pursued.

Project 23000E or Shtorm would be a nuclear-powered carrier 330 meters long and displacing one hundred thousand tons making it the closest competitor to a Ford-class carrier. Nuclear-powered the carrier will embark up to one hundred aircraft including a navalized version of the PAK-FA fifth-generation fighter.

There’s also the gigantic Lider-class nuclear-powered destroyer. At 17500 tons and two hundred meters long the Lider class is more akin to a cruiser than a destroyer. Armament will consist of sixty antiship cruise missiles 128 antiaircraft missiles and sixteen antiship guided missiles. The first ship is scheduled to begin production in 2019 with twelve entering service by 2025—an ambitious shipbuilding schedule to say the least.

Britain’s new flagship aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead six Royal Navy ships a Royal Navy submarine a US Navy destroyer and a frigate from the Netherlands in the largest concentration of maritime and air power to leave the UK in a generation.

Her Majesty the Queen visited her namesake vessel – which she commissioned in 2017 – this morning before the aircraft carrier set sail from Portsmouth meeting crew members and wishing them luck in what will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson was also among those to visit HMS Queen Elizabeth ahead of her departure joined on Friday by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin and Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston on the flight deck.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said:

The UK’s Carrier Strike Group today sets sail to write Britain’s name in the next chapter of history - a truly global Britain that steps forward to tackle the challenges of tomorrow working hand-in-hand with our friends to defend our shared values and uphold the rules-based international order.

This deployment shows that we are strong on our own but we are stronger with our allies. I want to join the nation in wishing the crews across the Carrier Strike Group every success as they depart on this truly historic endeavour.

In a projection of the UK’s global reach and influence the Carrier Strike Group will interact with over 40 nations during its 26000-nautical-mile global tour undertaking over 70 engagements exercises and operations with allies and partners.

As outlined in the recently-published Defence Command Paper the Carrier Strike Group is a demonstration of the UK’s commitment to be ready to confront future threats alongside international partners and help seize new opportunities for Global Britain.

Underscoring the UK’s leading role in NATO  in the coming days the Carrier Strike Group will take part in NATO ’s Exercise Steadfast Defender. The Strike Group will also provide support to the Alliance’s Operation Sea Guardian and to maritime security operations in the Black Sea during the deployment.

Working alongside another key NATO ally the Carrier Strike Group will be joined by French Aircraft Carrier Charles De Gaulle for a period of dual carrier operations in the Mediterranean.

In the Indo-Pacific the Carrier Strike Group will visit India Japan the Republic of Korea and Singapore to strengthen Britain’s security relationships reinforce political ties and support our UK exports and international trade agenda.

Elements of the Carrier Strike Group will also participate in Exercise Bersama Lima to mark the 50th anniversary of the Five Powers Defence Arrangements between Malaysia Singapore Australia New Zealand and the UK.

The next chapter in UK Carrier Strike capability

The deployment is primarily centred on regenerating the UK’s Carrier Strike capability – a decade-long journey which is now entering its next chapter.

It comes after the Prime Minister announced in November an increase in Defence funding of over £24-billion across the next four years enabling our Armed Forces to adapt to meet future threats.

The Strike Group’s cutting-edge platforms are expertly operated by 3700 personnel from the UK US and Netherlands armed forces including a company of Royal Marines Commandos.

HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest and most powerful surface vessel in the Royal Navy’s history. In a true success story for British industry she was built by a cast of more than 10000 including more than 800 apprentices in six dockyards from the banks of the Clyde to the River Torridge quaysides.

Joining her are a surface fleet of Type 45 destroyers HMS Defender and HMS Diamond Type 23 anti-submarine frigates HMS Kent and HMS Richmond and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary’s RFA Fort Victoria and RFA Tidespring.

US Navy destroyer USS The Sullivans and the Royal Netherlands Navy’s frigate HNLMS Evertsen will be fully integrated for the duration of the deployment.

On the carrier’s flight deck are eighteen state-of-the-art F-35B fast jets operated by joint RAF and Royal Navy 617 squadron and the US Marine Corps – the greatest quantity of fifth generation Lightning jets ever put to sea. Operating alongside the jets are four Wildcat maritime attack helicopters seven Merlin Mk2 anti-submarine helicopters and three Merlin Mk4 commando helicopters – the largest number of helicopters assigned to a single UK Task Group in a decade.

Commodore Steve Moorhouse Commander United Kingdom Carrier Strike Group said:

As the Carrier Strike Group heads to sea a new phase opens in Britain’s maritime renaissance. A year’s worth of exercises and more than a decade of preparation is over. HMS Queen Elizabeth her escorts and her aircraft will now begin the most important peacetime deployment in a generation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2hvdy1zYXVkaWEtb3V0Zmxldy1lbWlyYXRlcy1hbmQtcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy10by1iZWNvbWUtdGhlLWxhcmdlc3QtYWlybGluZS1pbi1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC_SAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9ob3ctc2F1ZGlhLW91dGZsZXctZW1pcmF0ZXMtYW5kLXFhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLXRoZS1sYXJnZXN0LWFpcmxpbmUtaW4tbWlkZGxlLWVhc3Qv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Saudi Arabia’s National Carrier Outflew Emirates Qatar Airways To Become The Largest Airlines In The Middle East,"This summer Saudia — Saudi Arabia’s national carrier — became the largest airline in the Middle East owing to its extensive domestic network that continued to grow despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Saudia has now surpassed Emirates and Qatar Airways which always took the center stage because of their massive hub-and-spoke networks and well-marketed hard products.

In transport jargon ‘hub-and-spoke’ refers to a network which connects every location through a single intermediary location called a hub. A central airport can be a hub through which flights are routed and spokes are the routes that planes take out of the central airport. This allows for greater flexibility within the transport system.

Saudia previously known as Saudi Arabian Airlines is headquartered in Jeddah. Its origin dates back to May 1945. Its emergence and development marked a watershed moment for the nation.

According to Simply Flying Saudia currently possesses 158 planes with 103 wide-body and 55 narrow-body aircraft. It has jumped from third place in summer 2019 to the top position despite a travel ban from 20 nations. While Emirates has slipped from the first to the second rank Qatar Airways has slipped from second to third position.

An analysis of anticipated seat capacity for every airline in the region using schedules provided by the carriers shows Saudia tops the list with 20.36 million round-trip seats this summer according to OAG a global travel data provider.

This is followed by Emirates: 19.88 million Qatar Airways: 18.69 million Etihad Airways: 7.26 million Flydubai 6.41 million Flynas: 4.56 million Turkish Airlines: 4.07 million Air Arabia: 3.98 million Oman Air: 3.21 million and Mahan Air: 3.14 million up to 10th spot.

Saudia’s new position has been aided by far larger cuts at the UAE and Qatar airlines: Emirates is down 52% while Qatar Airways is down 33%. Saudia on the other hand has reduced by only 26% as reported by Simply Flying.

Saudia’s leading position is due to its extensive domestic network which no other airline has been able to match this season. Given its short domestic routes and a huge fleet of narrow-body aircraft the carrier is also the Middle East’s top airline by total flights.

Saudia aims to fly to 34 countries this summer. The airline’s domestic service now accounts for over six in ten seats. The top 10 countries it serves are: Saudi Arabia 12.51 million seats followed by Egypt (1.36 million) UAE (1.10 million) Pakistan (960000) India (744000) Bangladesh (527000) Sudan (387000) Indonesia (346000) Turkey (328000) and UK ( 215000).

Jeddah is Saudi Arabia’s key international airport. Before the pandemic Saudi Arabia had planned to build a “hub-and-spoke” system in Jeddah. The opening of Terminal One in September 2019 with 45 contact stands and a capacity of 30 million passengers are some key steps taken in this regard.

With 628000 seats Saudia’s most popular route is Jeddah to Cairo which has remained unchanged since 2019 however the number is drastically reduced. In August it will operate 35 weekly flights on this route."

The TGE 3.180 4x4 combi van sports a special caterpillar drive and no snow-covered slopes or muddy meadows can stand between it and its destination.

As the German manufacturer puts it the 4x4 combi van is basically a MAN TGE converted to track drive. The conversion allows it to be used both during winter with the caterpillar drive and in the summer with regular tires. It can carry goods to supply remote alpine pastures and transport up to eight passengers to remote mountain resorts.According to MAN the conversion can be applied to its entire range of vans . Similar to a wheel change the assembly and disassembly should take less than an hour to convert to the caterpillar drive. This adds an additional weight of about 300 kg (661 lbs). Plus the TGE's width also increases by 2400 mm (94.5 in).The caterpillar drive can reach speeds between 25 and 50 kph (15 - 31 mph) with the eight-speed automatic transmission normally running between first and third gear. The Innsbruck crawler transporter has enough ground clearance to perform its tasks in extreme terrain thanks to the Seikel chassis which is elevated by around 3 cm (1.18 in). Since the van is slowed by standard disc brakes no adjustments were made there.With its converted caterpillar drive the TGE cannot go on public roads. It will still have to use its standard summer tires for that. The swapping processes should be simple thanks to an adapter plate that is secured with the original wheel bolts much like switching the snow tires with the summer ones.The TGE 3.180 4x4 combi van is designed for getting to mountain areas and hard-to-reach locations. Ski resorts alpine pastures muddy tracks or hotels are the ideal places where the vehicle can be used for high-altitude transport.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS93aW5kc29yL3dpbmRzb3Itc2FybmlhLWxhbWJ0b24tc2hvcmVzLWd5cHN5LW1vdGhzLTEuNjAzNzA4NtIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42MDM3MDg2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gypsy moth caterpillars 'virtually everywhere' in SW Ontario expert says,"The City of Sarnia completed its second annual gypsy moth spray on Friday due to another severe outbreak of the gypsy moth caterpillars — but the infestation has spread to regions across Southern Ontario.

""This is the worst infestation I have seen since the eighties"" said Paul Zimmer president and operations manager of Zimmer Air Services the company that conducts aerial biological spray programs.

Zimmer's company performed sprays for the city of Sarnia on May 14 and then again on May 21. Four regions in the city were sprayed after being identified as having severe or moderate to severe infestations.

""This year it is virtually everywhere from Sarnia to Peterborough up to Midland"" said Zimmer. ""It encompasses a very large area and it is moving north.""

Zimmer Air conducted its first spray over Sarnia on May 14 2021 (Patti Ross Manager of Parks Forestry & Horticulture City of Sarnia )

According to Zimmer the company has committed to do aerial sprays for over 6000 individual contracts eight municipalities and six reservations this year.

He expects to cover about 50000 acres of land throughout Ontario ranging from municipal park lands maple bushes cottage areas and forestry woodlots.

What are gypsy moths?

Gypsy moths are an invasive species brought to Canada from Europe in the 1860s. They have been found in North Africa Asia and Japan but according to Natural Resources Canada it's the European moths that are seen throughout Quebec and Ontario.

The eggs of a gypsy moth caterpillar hatch in early spring to mid May. Once the larvae emerge they eat large amounts of foliage. One caterpillar can eat up to a square meter of foliage according to Chris MacQuarrie a research scientist with Natural Resource Canada's Great Lakes Forestry Centre.

Over time this defoliation can weaken or kill trees. Oak trees are particularly vulnerable but according to MacQuarrie gypsy moths do not discriminate.

""They really like oak and birch and certainly in the north they like aspen. They also eat maple and beech and they'll even go after softwood trees"" said MacQuarrie.

Gypsy moth infestations come in cycles that tend to peak about every 10 years or so and each outbreak can last a few years.

In 2019 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry surveyed approximately 47000 hectares of land infected by gypsy moths. In 2020 more than 580000 hectares were mapped out.

""Their survey predicted a fair amount of damage to some parts of Ontario this year"" said MacQuarrie.

How to deal with them

There are a few ways to deal with gypsy moth infestations such as purchasing individual bottles of biological spray from hardware stores to be applied on an infested tree but MacQuarrie suggests wrapping a bag of burlap around the trunk of the tree.

""The caterpillars will come down during the day to hide underneath the burlap to get away from predators"" he said.

""You can come along in the evening to pick the caterpillars out from underneath the burlap and drop them in a bucket of soapy water and that will kill them. That will keep the population from going on your trees in your yard.""

Gypsy moth action group

Last year's outbreak of gypsy moths in Lambton Shores sparked the development of an action group. The Gypsy Moth Citizens Action group was created by a number of Port Franks residents who were badly affected by the caterpillars.

""It was horrendous"" said Romayne Smith Fullerton spokesperson for the group.

""These moths created a landscape devastation that is shocking.""

Fullerton says her backyard was covered in frass gypsy moth feces.

Due to the legs from the caterpillars that were released into the air and the frass the caterpillars left many people with allergies had bad reactions.

""Many people could not go outside last year"" said Fullerton.

The group says it's still early in the season so they haven't seen the full impact of this year just yet.

The group also advocated for a municipal aerial spray in 2020 but the city council objected to a blanket aerial spray.

""Our local council voted to not object to private spraying but they would let us individually organize ourselves and they would not object to that"" said Fullerton.

Fullerton said the municipality agreed to spray a small buffer area of their municipal property with BTK a biological spray if adjacent private property owners were spraying their properties as well as pay for a buffer spray for a private property if the owner paid for the spray.

This year Paul Zimmer is contracted to do approximately 1800 individually contracted sprays in Lambton-Shores. but the municipality completed its first aerial spray on May 17.

""We've been doing this for many many years it's all in the planning"" said Zimmer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGVzb25saW5lLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd2FsZXMtbmV3cy9hcmNoaWUtYWxsZXJneS1uZXctY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXItY2FrZS0yMDY1OTU1NdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGVzb25saW5lLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd2FsZXMtbmV3cy9hcmNoaWUtYWxsZXJneS1uZXctY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXItY2FrZS0yMDY1OTU1NS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The reason why a supermarket caterpillar cake is named after a brave Welsh eight-year-old,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Not since Coleen Rooney versus Rebekah Vardy had the British public been so engrossed in a legal case than when a trademark battle between two chocolate caterpillar cakes took the nation by storm.

It all started when Marks & Spencer launched an intellectual property claim against Aldi with M&S alleging that the supermarket's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake infringed its own Colin the Caterpillar cake trademark.

After dividing Twitter users and making headlines around the world the ongoing legal row entered a new stage last week as Cuthbert returned to Aldi stores nationwide having performed a dramatic skydive to raise money for charity.

For many the case brought to light just how many different anthropomorphic caterpillar sponge logs are available in UK supermarkets.

Tesco has Curly Asda sells Clyde Waitrose's got Cecil Morrisons offers Morris and Sainsbury's has Wiggles.

But now there's a new extra-special name joining the ranks - Archie the Caterpillar.

Made by nut-free celebration cake producer Just Love Food Company Archie is the first vegan caterpillar cake to launch in the UK and is also egg peanut nut and milk-free.

While the cake is currently only available to buy online at TheVeganKind Supermarket for £6.99 it is set to be available supermarket-wide in around three months time.

But there is even more to Archie than meets the eye and tastebuds as he is also named after a brave young boy from Cardiff who has serious food allergies.

At four years old Archie from Penylan went into anaphylactic shock after being touched by his cousin who had peanut dust on his fingers and was taken to hospital struggling to breathe and red and swollen all over.

After being discharged from hospital and referred to an allergy clinic Archie was diagnosed with allergies to peanuts tree nuts - including walnuts almonds and cashews - and cooked and uncooked egg.

Since then he has gone on to suffer five more serious anaphylactic episodes and over 100 smaller reactions which have brought him out in hives and caused his face to swell.

Months after his diagnosis he had another anaphylactic reaction after walking past an open bag of walnuts and just last month was left with swollen lips after eating some Chewits sweets which contain egg white powder.

Archie's mum Charlotte Murphy said both she and her son were ""bursting with pride"" at him lending his name to the new cake.

""It makes me incredibly proud that through everything Archie has been noticed and is being honoured in such a positive way for his allergies.

""Archie is bursting with pride over it he cannot believe he has his very own caterpillar cake that's not only been named after him but is also inclusive for other children just like him living with food allergies.

""He loves that he can actually eat it because it's free from eggs nuts peanuts and milk.""

As Archie can go into anaphylaxis so easily Charlotte said it is ""a daily struggle"" navigating parts of life that others simply take for granted in order to keep him safe.

""For Archie tree nuts peanuts and egg are a deadly weapon to him and you're constantly on red alert"" she said.



""We can't just up and go somewhere - everything has to be planned down to ringing restaurants wiping down seats and carrying everything Archie needs to save his life - including his epi pen.""

""Every food he eats has to be checked thoroughly even when he uses paints or even soap.

""We can't just go to the park because children are having fun and eating ice creams and their hands get sticky they only have to touch a railing or swing and Archie could go into anaphylaxis.""

Archie is not alone - an estimated two million people in the UK are living with a diagnosed food allergy according to The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation.

But despite this Charlotte said that allergies are still neglected in the UK by the government and health and education boards.

""They all have a part to play in raising awareness that to some food can kill. Until another child has to die because of the lack of education around food allergies nothing will change for those living with serious allergies"" she added.

""Archie has been excluded from things because of his food allergies but there is never any reason to exclude a child from anything.

""As a mum you only want your child to feel happiness and love but because of his food allergies he has experienced anxiety fear loneliness and bullying.

""Children shouldn't have to live this way - it's unjust and unfair to expect children to carry such a burden.""

In March 2019 Archie's ordeals led Charlotte to start her own charity - Archie’s Allergies - which supports families of affected children and young people and aims to educate others on the importance of being kinder to those living with food allergies.

Just Love Food Company who make the new Archie the Caterpillar cake have dedicated a section of its packaging to the charity and Charlotte and Archie's story.

""It's a privilege that the charity is being recognised for our efforts of preventing allergic reactions and everything we're doing to encourage children to be more positive about such a serious medical condition"" said Charlotte.

""It can be incredibly scary to think we can die from just one bite or touch of food and we're supporting families going through that.""

Through Archie’s Allergies Charlotte aims to promote allergy awareness as well as empowering child sufferers through producing stickers and badges that normalise their allergies and make others aware of them.

During lockdown the charity sent out 3000 ""allergy boxes"" - containing stickers postcards and craft activities - to children and also received funding to provide food for allergy sufferers as supplies of allergen free food were threatened at the beginning of the pandemic.

Last month for Allergy Awareness Week the charity’s young followers were also encouraged to make allergy awareness posters for their school and talk to their friends and classmates about their allergies.

“We want to empower these children - they are so brave to live with the fact that the possibility of death for them is everywhere every day"" said Charlotte.

“That’s what the badges do they say ‘hey no eggs’ or ‘I don't do nuts’ so they don’t have to keep reminding people. We have parents message us crying - they wouldn’t have thought that badges would bring them so much joy.

“We just want to be a voice for these children we want to show people that allergies are normal as it’s just the fear that gets people the most.

But even with the charity’s progress and the appreciative feedback Charlotte knows there could still be a long way to go before allergies are given the attention that they deserve.

“Our story is not unique there are people that are identical to us and some are even worse” she said. “You feel so helpless sometimes because all you want to do is show these children that they are not what these people are making them feel like they are.

“Sadly we live in a world where it’s not until somebody dies that we want to do anything about it. I’m not willing for my child or another child with food allergies to die because somebody wasn’t bothered or they weren't paying attention or because they thought they knew better.

“I’m so happy that we’ve helped so many families like us but there’s only so much we can do and say - we now need others to not be afraid of approaching the subject.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vc2NpLXRlY2gvZW5lcmd5LWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnZhc2l2ZS1zcGVjaWVzLWNvc3RpbmctYWZyaWNhLTM2Ni10cmlsbGlvbi1hLXllYXItc3R1ZHkvYXJ0aWNsZTYwNjgyMzYwLmVjZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Invasive species costing Africa $3.66 trillion a year: study,"May 22 2021 12:49 pm | Updated December 02 2021 10:45 pm IST - Paris France

Invasive species introduced by human activity are costing African agriculture some $3.66 trillion every year — around 1.5 times the combined gross domestic product of all African countries — new research showed Thursday.

Non-native species of weed insect or worm can have catastrophic effects on farming with just a single bug capable of reducing yields of staple crops across the continent.

Now researchers based in Ghana Kenya Britain and Switzerland have sought to estimate the annual economic hit caused by invasive species to African agriculture.

The team studied open source and peer-reviewed literature on species that were not native to the continent but had caused crop losses to assess the economic impact on yield management and the cost of research.

Next they surveyed more than 1000 stakeholders — including farmers researchers and government officials — about the financial implications of invasive species.

Participants were asked to estimate crop losses caused by invasive alien species as well as the costs incurred.

Thee team found that the average cost of invasive alien species to the agricultural sector in Africa's 54 countries was $74.3 billion each year.

But there was substantial variation among countries. The worst affected nations were found to be Nigeria — which loses around $1 trillion annually due to invasive species — and the Democratic Republic of the Congo which loses $317 billion each year.

In all economic losses by invasive alien species were found to exceed the GDP of 27 out of 49 countries included in the study which was published in the journal CABI Agriculture and Bioscience .

'Wake-up call'

The overwhelming majority (99.2% or $3.63 trillion) of estimated total costs inflicted by alien species came from removing invasive weeds from crops.

Weeding cereal crops accounted for 72% ($2.61 trillion) of this the authors found while weeding maize and root crops accounts for 14% ($508 billion) and weeding vegetables accounts for 3.3% ($120 billion).

Rene Eschen corresponding study author from Switzerland's CABI research institute said the research highlighted the hidden economic and social costs of having to weed crops across the continent.

""The removal of invasive alien weeds is largely unpaid work and is primarily carried out by women and children reducing the amount of time they are able to spend on income-generating and community activities or education"" he said.

The species found to cause the most crop losses was a moth known as Phthorimaea absoluta  which affects tomato plants at an estimated cost of $11.4 billion annually.

Other insects were estimated to inflict more than $21.5 billion worth of crop losses each year to maize cassava and mango and citrus crops.

The authors cautioned that their findings may in fact underestimate the true economic cost of invasive species to Africa's agriculture sector as they didn't include costs related to chemical herbicides used to control pests and disease.

Kat Kramer climate change lead at Christian Aid said Thursday’s research showed an additional ""often overlooked"" challenge for Africa that should feed in to G7 discussions next month.

""One of the drivers of invasive species is a changing climate as new plants threaten the established crops which people rely on for both food and income"" she told AFP . ""This report should be a wake up call to leaders preparing to meet for the G7.""

Mohamed Adow director of the Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa said the research showed ""the huge battle that Africa faces to bring prosperity to its people"".

""This is yet further evidence for the need for greater support from richer nations to help Africans be that through strengthening aid budgets cancelling unpayable debts and delivering on climate finance to help people adapt to these challenges"" he told AFP .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbmNlaGFsbG1hZy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9tdXNpYy9hZ2VudC1zYXNjby1oaXMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItbGMtOC1yZWxlYXNlLWlmLWNhdGVycGlsbGFycy1jYW4tZmx5LXNvLWNhbi1pLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Agent Sasco His Daughter LC 8 Release ""If Caterpillars Can Fly So Can I""","Agent Sasco daughter LC

The responses from the Winning artist’s fans have been filled with wonder and amazement about LC’s exceptional vocals and the switching between singing and deejaying by the duo in the song.

“Extremely beautiful 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾” his Dancehall/reggae compatriot Romain Virgo himself a father of twin girls posted in response.

“Chills all over…with a dad like Sasco shine LC shine❤️❤️❤️❤️”

macsue.1 wrote while prettyjamaicangirl1 noted: “Heard this on Miss Kittys show a few minutes ago the perfect song for Childs month🙌🏾🙌🏾 Sasco you did an awesome job LC you did a phenomenal job!! Continue spreading positivity and love💕”.

Both Sasco’s Instagram page and YouTube channel and his wife Nicole Mclaren Campbell’s Instagram page were flooded with declarations that the song was deserving of being featured in Disney children’s movie and this should be pursued.

“Disney have fi link you or some executive producer for some cartoons or something this one nah go suh’ Pierre Bennett said.

“International cartoon movie deal coming..memba mi tell.yu!” silmadelbennett predicted while fontisha_gardner wrote: “I really do think her dad should push this song Because it sound like something belong in one of those Disney animated movies 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️”.

“Why this sound like Disney gonna buy the audio for a movie song so 😢😢😢😢Awwwee @agentsasco @thelcshow nailed it😍😍😍😍”

tesharasounique added.

If the song does become featured as a movie soundtrack it should come as no surprise as Sasco already has a foothold where that is concerned having done work for Paramount Pictures where he made his vocal presence heard in two soundtracks in the blockbuster movie Baywatch in 2017.

Sasco was featured on two compositions in the Baywatch movie Off the Jetty and Leeds – To the Tower in The Paramount Picture which starred Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and Zac Efron.

As for the If Caterpillars Can Fly So Can I book author Alvin Day the past student of Edwin Allen High School and Knox College said that it was his grandmother’s words of life that formed the concept behind his widely acclaimed book.

The Frankfield Clarendon native who is the founder and Executive Director of Global Empowerment Institute said that he “grew up in a poor household with his grandmother after his parents migrated said he did not have the privileges or the “respectability of people around me and in fact many people didn’t expect me to make it.

“We didn’t have electricity in our home. I studied for my exams using lamplight—Home Sweet Home! We didn’t have running water so I used to bathe in the Rio Minho to go to school” he said at a presentation of 26000 copies of the book valued at approximately US$129000.00 to public school teachers in Jamaica on Read Across Jamaica Day.

“My grandmother would say ‘Don’t worry about the children who tease you. You may look like a little caterpillar on the outside but you’re going to grow up to be a good man one day if you trust in God and do the right things. You are going to burst out wings and learn to fly. Because of that I was able to grow up and pursue my dreams” he added.

Day had also encouraged teachers to take exceptional care of the children that fall under their supervision.

“Take solace in the fact that in your hands you have the next generation… Treat them well. Do everything that you can because they think of you as a parent friend counsellor and guide. You have an important role in shaping the next generation and I want to encourage you when the pain is hard remember that you too have wings and you can fly” he said."

Depending on the type of vehicle you are renting and on your location these protections may vary but typically you will have the choice to choose from for four or five different protections.

In this article I will break down what these protections are and why you may choose to decline these protections.

What is Enterprise Rental Car Insurance?

Enterprise Rental Car Insurance contains a number of different protections that you can choose to purchase.

These include:

Damage waiver (DW)

Personal accident insurance (PAI)

Supplemental liability protection (SLP)

Roadside assistance protection (RAP)

Each protection will protect you from liability or loss in a different way so you’ll want to be familiar with the differences in protection before choosing to rent your vehicle.

Tip: Use WalletFlo for all your credit card needs. It’s free and will help you optimize your rewards and savings!

Damage waiver (DW)

Damage waiver (DW) also referred to as collision damage waiver (CDW) is what many people refer to as “rental car insurance.” It’s actually not insurance so a better term to describe it would be “rental car coverage.”

This coverage will protect you in the event of damage or theft to the vehicle.

The damage waiver will be optional and you can purchase it for an additional fee. This fee can vary dramatically based on your location and the type of vehicle.

You could be paying anywhere from $5 to $50 per day for it so it is vital that you understand how much you will be paying per day. (On average I would expect to pay somewhere around $20 a day.)

Be on the lookout for restrictions in certain countries because you may find that coverage does not apply to places like Mexico.

Because of the additional expense involved with damage waiver I would highly recommend that you seek out a quality travel credit card that comes with collision damage waiver.

The go-to card for this benefit for a lot of people is the Chase Sapphire Preferred which provides primary rental car coverage.

Primary rental car coverage is very important because it means you will not have to file a claim with your auto insurance company.

The annual fee for the Chase Sapphire Preferred is only $95 so in many cases you can completely offset the annual fee just by using the collision damage waiver once or twice.

Tip: If using a card like that be sure to decline the coverage from the rental car company or you could void your credit card coverage!

One last thing to note your standard auto insurance policy may not cover you for all of the fees associated with an accident. For example if you don’t rent through a partner or obtain CDW USAA may not cover the following:

Loss of use of the vehicle if damaged.

Decrease in the value of the vehicle due to any damage sustained.

Administrative costs.

The right to repair or salvage the damaged vehicle.

Personal accident insurance

Personal accident insurance (PAI) provides the renter and the renter’s passengers with accidental death accident medical expenses and ambulance expense benefits.

So this coverage extends beyond damage or theft vehicle and actually protects you in the event you or any of your passengers are physically injured.

Once again the price for this coverage can range but typically you will be paying somewhere between $5 and $13 per day.

If your insurance provider already offers this protection then you will not need to duplicate it and you should feel free to decline it.

For example my auto insurance via USAA covers accidents while renting vehicles so it doesn’t make sense for me to accept the protection from Enterprise.

The best way to get assurance about your coverage is to call up your car insurance company and ask about how your policy applies to rental cars.

Even better ask them to provide you with a document outlining your coverage so that you could have something on-hand.

Supplemental liability protection (SLP)

Supplemental liability protection provides the renter and any of the authorized drivers with up to $300000 of combined single limit coverage for third-party liability claims.

SLP is primary to any other coverage and will respond to third party accident claims that result from bodily injury including death and property damage that arise from the use or operation of vehicle

So to help you distinguish this from the protections above consider the following example.

Let’s say that you drive your rental car into a steel post and really damage the vehicle but you were not injured nor was anybody else. Collision damage waiver coverage will likely protect you and you will not be liable for damage to the vehicle from the steel post.

But let’s say that when you hit that post you injured your back and had to call an ambulance to take you to the hospital. If you signed up for the personal accident insurance you should get coverage for your accidental medical expenses and ambulance expenses.

Now let’s say that you knocked over that pole and it injured someone else and now they are suing you. Well if you have supplemental liability protection then you will be covered up to $300000 from the third-party liability claim.

The exact way that this protection is set up is that Enterprise covers you up to the applicable minimum responsibility limit and then excess coverage kicks in from Zurich American Insurance Company.

This coverage will typically cost you between $8 and $17 per day.

Be on the lookout for some of the same restrictions such as this policy not applying in countries like Mexico.

Once again your rental car coverage may already provide you with his protection so be sure to check to your terms.

Roadside assistance protection (RAP)

Roadside assistance protection is meant to help you out in situations where you have common roadside incidents such as running out of gas or getting locked out of your vehicle. Enterprise will allow you to waive financial responsibility for these instances.

Something to note about this benefit with Enterprise is that roadside assistance can be added to a rental ticket at any time.

So if you are in the middle of your rental period you can simply call and add it to your rental ticket but you will have to have the vehicle inspected before getting the coverage added.

Some credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve offer some really great roadside assistance. So once again if you choose the right travel credit card you can turn down these additional protections and save yourself some money.

Final word

These are all optional products that you can add in order to provide you with more protection as you hit the road in your rental car.

I personally never add these to my rental car tickets because I already have coverage for these needs from my car insurance policy and/or my travel credit cards.

This has allowed me to save hundreds of dollars in fees so I would recommend looking into the right credit cards so that you don’t have to worry about adding these on to your bill.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That main line work that began under Vectren is this year impacting 13 communities in a four-county area including Centerville Dayton Fairborn Kettering Oakwood Riverside and Xenia CenterPoint said.

The 14-mile transmission line replacement resulting in the trench work started after an inspection “revealed reasons for us to replace the pipeline” said Alyssia Oshodi a CenterPoint spokeswoman.

The transmission lines were built in the 1950s and “we continuously go in and inspect the lines and if it reveals to us there is a need to replace it” she added.

The Centerville trench work runs northeast from Yankee Street to Wilmington Pike records show. It includes digging paths across 50-foot wide right of way in residential neighborhoods according to the city.

Trench work runs just west of Ohio 48 through Revere Village Apartments across Virginia Avenue and behind the Centerville Library and the city police department both on West Spring Valley Road.

CenterPoint is seeking to reduce any disruptions and will restore the property when the work is done Oshodi said.

“Our goal is always to try and complete these projects as quickly as possible and minimize the impact to our customers” she said. “We understand that it can be an inconvenience.”

Work in Centerville is expected to be completed by August as will part of the Bellbrook project Oshodi said. Cedarville and Wilberforce projects are planned to be done by November.

Work will continue next year in Bellbrook and Xenia she said.

Longtime Centerville resident Jim Bohman received a CenterPoint letter several weeks ago stating that his Black Oak Estates home is in the project’s path.

Bohman said some of his neighbors didn’t see a CenterPoint notice or may have overlooked it. Centerville Public Works Director Pat Turnbull said “there may be some confusion” as the company name is still relatively new to the Dayton area after the 2019 completion of its deal with Vectren.

The letter Bohman received mentioned a 50-foot wide right of way and “the adjacent 20-foot temporary easement” he said.

Bohman said when he bought the land in the early 1970s he was told of the right of way in the rear of the property. He said it was owned by DP&L and later Vectren.

Bohman initially thought he might lose a backyard shed he built in the mid-1980s. But he said Friday that crews were working behind his house and it appeared his property might be spared.

“We’ve really lucked out” he said. “I don’t think I’m going to lose my shed and I think they’re going to put the entire pipeline on the other side of the property line and put the dirt there too.

“So we may be getting out of this free and clear” Bohman added. “But the neighbors across the way are going to get all of the dirt and the pipeline.”

These Dayton-area counties are involved in this year’s CenterPoint Energy natural gas main pipeline replacement a project that started in 2009. It is separate from a 20-inch transmission line the company is replacing in Bellbrook Cedarville Centerville and Wilberforce this year.

CHTR,Charter Communications,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdmlsYmVhdC5vcmcvMjAyMS8wNS9uby1iaWQtbm8tcHJvYmxlbS1oYXdhaWlhbi10ZWxjb20tbGFuZHMtYS0yNS1taWxsaW9uLWNvbnRyYWN0LWZvci1icm9hZGJhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No Bid No Problem? Hawaiian Telcom Lands A $25 Million State Broadband Contract,"Gov. David Ige’s administration has awarded a $25 million no-bid contract to Hawaiian Telcom to deliver broadband to eight underserved areas of the state after Hawaiian Telcom submitted an unsolicited proposal for the project to the state Department of Transportation.

The unusual contract raises questions about whether Ige had any role in the deal because the governor worked for Hawaiian Telcom for 18 years and for a time was the company’s lobbyist. He has also received nearly $18000 in campaign donations from Hawaiian Telcom in the past decade.

But a spokeswoman for Ige said the governor was not involved in the procurement exemption in any way and did not discuss the matter with Hawaiian Telcom staff or executives before the award.

Transportation officials justified the no-bid contract in a filing with the State Procurement Office by asserting that Hawaiian Telcom “is the only provider in the state to own and operate broadband capacity on the Inter-Island fiber network.”

However a spokesman for Charter Communications countered that “of course the contract should have been competitively bid. Hawaii residents deserve the best products at the lowest price especially when tens of millions of public dollars are being spent.”

Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2020

Charter offers broadband cable and other services in Hawaii as Spectrum and competes with Hawaiian Telcom.

“ Spectrum has the capability and network assets to provide the desired services” said Charter spokesman Dennis Johnson. “We operate and manage broadband networks serving more than 31 million customers including 467000 in Hawaii.”

When asked if Charter intends to challenge the procurement exemption for Hawaiian Telcom Johnson replied that “we are reviewing the situation and don’t have anything to add right now.”

Ige used his State of the State address on Jan. 25 to underscore his commitment to expanding access to broadband explaining that “the pandemic has highlighted the digital inequity in Hawaii.”

In the same speech Ige announced he had instructed DOT Deputy Director for Highways Ed Sniffen “to accelerate his pilot project to connect rural communities to broadband service. He will be leveraging federal funds with state and private sector resources.”

That “pilot project” is focused on improving or extending service in Puna and Kau on Hawaii island; in Hana Maui; in Nanakuli Waianae Waimanalo and Kalihi on Oahu; and in Kapaa Kauai.

Sniffen said Hawaiian Telcom sent an unsolicited proposal to DOT shortly after the State of the State address and transportation officials then began discussions with the company.

On Feb. 16 which was three weeks after Ige’s speech the State Procurement Office received a request from the Highways Division seeking an exemption from state procurement requirements. It sought permission to hire Hawaiian Telecom without competitive bidding to do the pilot project under a contract for up to $25 million.

The procurement office granted “conditional approval” to that request provided a number of requirements are met and a notice of award of the contract was posted Feb. 25.

Developing a formal request for proposals or RFP for the project would have allowed other vendors to try to bid competitively for the contract but “the difficult thing for us would be to build out that RFP now to cover that pilot mainly because of the time it takes for procurement” Sniffen said.

“Procurement time frame is like a year minimum and a year that’s the time frame especially now when everybody needs that service” he said. “So it’s better for the state and its residents for us to move forward very quickly. The procurement exemption gives us that in spades.”

Ige agreed saying in a written statement that “the pandemic accelerated the need for children doing remote learning and parents working from home to have connectivity to the internet.”

“Procurement using normal processes would have taken at least a year to develop the scope of work and the RFP then another 6 months to go through the procurement process” Ige said in the statement.

“The exemption allowed us to work directly with a provider to hammer out the details of service provision and run through iterations that would not be allowed by the bid process” he said in the statement. “This process is a feasible and prudent approach to a pilot project which will inform the direction of the future full builds for the state.”

“As a result of using this process we will start up installation in Kalihi one of the 8 pilot communities by July of this year” Ige said.

Sniffen also stressed the “pilot project” nature of the deal in which the state will start with a limited scope project and then expand later.

“We don’t know all the barriers we don’t know the best methodology to put out those types of services so we wanted to make sure that we piloted first” Sniffen said.

At this point the state doesn’t know how to incorporate the project’s issues and challenges into a larger request for proposals or RFP that could be used in competitive bidding.

“Best case scenario what I would love to do is put out a statewide RFP to cover all unserved and underserved areas” Sniffen said. “I don’t know how to design an RFP like that. I don’t know how to design the facilities yet. I don’t know what the barriers and challenges are.”

Timing is also important because the state has a deadline to spend the federal money.

In the written submittal seeking the exemption from competitive procurement state transportation officials said the department received $42 million in COVID-19 relief funds from the Federal Highways Administration and the federal pandemic relief money must be spent by September 2024.

The broadband project grows out of a larger initiative to wire up rights of way and intersections to connect them to a network so that signal lights cameras and data collection devices can all be controlled remotely.

Wiring up the highway system also allows the state to install signaling equipment for the autonomous vehicles of the future Sniffen said.

“Procurement using normal processes would have taken at least a year to develop the scope of work and the RFP then another 6 months to go through the procurement process.” — Gov. David Ige

The system the state is building along the roadways will pass by or into underserved communities offering an opportunity to improve broadband service in those areas he said.

“We thought it was a really good connection … to utilize the infrastructure that we’re building out to push more service into communities” he said.

Sniffen said that under the state’s partnership with Hawaiian Telcom the company will string lines within rights-of-way belonging to the Highways Division expanding the reach of broadband service. When the contract is finished Hawaiian Telcom will own the fiber and other wiring it installed he said.

Wi-Fi equipment will then be installed under a separate contract to provide broadband service in the targeted underserved communities which include the Towers at Kuhio Park public housing complex in Kalihi formerly known as Kuhio Park Terrace.

Under the contract Hawaiian Telcom will provide the communities in the pilot project with free managed Wi-Fi service for three to five years.

The infrastructure that will be installed to do that will remain in place when the contract ends and community members can then use that wiring to hook up to the service providers of their choice Sniffen said.

That state partnership with Hawaiian Telcom is preferable to a competitively bid procurement because the company can “manage the broadband network end-to-end” according to the submittal to the State Procurement Office.

“Without working with a vendor with end to end ownership of the system the state would need to work with multiple vendors when issues arise resolution may not be as timely nor as cost efficient” according to the submittal seeking the procurement code exemption.

But Johnson of Charter Communications disputed that statement suggesting ownership of an interisland cable should not be a requirement.

“Spectrum is fully responsible for addressing issues for its customers and the state would not have to engage another vendor even if a problem arose with interisland or transpacific fiber-optic cables” he said.

“Spectrum provides broadband internet to hundreds of thousands of residential customers and small business and enterprise clients in Hawaii without having to own inter-island or transpacific fiber and has previously won multiple bids from the state” Johnson said.

Sniffen noted the state posted a notice that DOT was seeking the procurement exemption “and when we did that nobody came back with any questions comments concerns or any pushback.”

However the State Procurement Office did instruct DOT to submit more information about the actual costs of the Hawaiian Telcom service in a document called a “Memorandum for Record — Price Reasonableness Determination” before any services are provided.

Sniffen said DOT has not actually executed the contract with Hawaiian Telcom and “if we come up with something that’s not the best deal for the state then we won’t go forward. If it is the best deal then we’re moving forward on it.”

Sniffen said there is no written scope of contract available that would spell out what Hawaiian Telcom will do because that is still being developed. But he said that “their scope is to provide a system a service in the areas that we’ve selected.”

The time frame for providing service in each area is still being negotiated he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vcmVsaWdpb24vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9sZHMtd29tZW4tY2h1cmNoLWxlYWRlcnMtd2hlbi1kaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LDS women push back — again — against an address delivered by a Relief Society leader,"(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints explained that even though she worked outside the home her priority has always been motherhood.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

FAIRVIEW Texas — A new proposed temple in Fairview is the talk of the town.

The Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints has proposed to build a large temple next to an existing church off Stacy Road. The McKinney Texas Temple is one of eight other worship buildings in operation announced or under construction in the state of Texas.

A number of residents from the surrounding residential communities are bracing for a fight over the size of a temple for the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints. Last week the Church held an open house and invited residents and media to discuss the project.

""It's just a good-faith effort to be able to share details about our project listen to their concerns and have them ask questions"" said Church spokeswoman Melissa McKneely.

But some of the residents who spoke with WFAA did not get a warm feeling from the open house meeting.

They tell WFAA they were ushered into a gym and their movements and speech throughout the facility were 'controlled' by organizers. Community members wore green shirts that read ""Fairview United"" and the words ""Keeping it Country and not an inch more.""

""They should not be given not an inch more than the ordinance"" said Inga Fredrickson of Fairview United.

The Church's spire is what is drawing the ire. It is proposed to be 173 feet and 8 inches tall and it is proposed to be built right next to their existing church.

""It doesn't blend in with the landscape. It's obnoxious. It's inconsiderate. It's inappropriate"" said Fredrickson.

The 16-story spire would make it the tallest structure in Fairview as tall as its water tower. There is currently no town ordinance that accommodates a structure at that height. The Church tells WFAA that they have satisfied every other town guideline as it relates to property.

""The spire and the temple are very significant to us religiously and the spire is a representation of something reaching up to the heavens and it helps us look to heaven and God"" said McKneely.

Residents tell WFAA that an attorney for the Church spoke with residents and justified the church's plans by citing constitutional religious freedoms. WFAA could not independently verify comments made at the meeting.

""We want them to get their church. They're just not allowed to build it at the size they're trying to build it"" said Fredrickson.

The town's planning and zoning committee will take up the issue Thursday evening. The town council will likely take up the issue soon after that.

""Exceptions have been made for churches in the past and we hope that an exception will be made for us to have a house of worship here"" said McKneely.

Also at issue are traffic and crowds. The Church says it has already made concessions on lighting of the temple due to the town's Dark Sky Ordinances. The Church tells WFAA the temple is not a place for mass gatherings. McKneely tells WFAA that at any one time there will be 30 to 40 people present at the temple.

The residents say they will continue to fight to keep Fairview their small town.

The Church says they're simply building a place of worship. If approved the McKinney Texas Temple will be the largest temple in the state of Texas.

""I hope that we will be seen as good neighbors"" said the Church.

If plans are approved by the town the Church will begin the three-year construction of the temple by the end of this year or early next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RpZGFob25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvY2h1cmNoLWVtcGxveWVlLWFsbGVnZWRseS1zdGVhbHMtb3Zlci0zMzAwMDAtZnJvbS1wcmVzYnl0ZXJpYW4tY2h1cmNoLW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church employee allegedly steals over $330000 from Presbyterian church organization,"IDAHO FALLS — A 31-year-old church employee was arrested after she allegedly stole over $330000 from a local Presbyterian organization.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2VwaXNjb3BhbG5ld3NzZXJ2aWNlLm9yZy8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2NvbW1pdHRlZXMtaGVhci10ZXN0aW1vbnktb24tYWRkaXRpb25zLXRvLXRoZS1jaHVyY2gtY2FsZW5kYXItcHJvcG9zZWQtaHltbmFsLXN1cHBsZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Committees hear testimony on additions to the church calendar proposed hymnal supplement,"[Episcopal News Service] The legislative committees on Prayer Book Liturgy & Music tackled a weighty agenda during its May 8 meeting receiving testimony on eight of the 23 resolutions scheduled for a hearing.

Most of the people who signed up to testify addressed resolutions that would add people to the official church calendar. Because the calendar often known as Lesser Feasts and Fasts is considered part of the Book of Common Prayer any changes require action by two consecutive General Conventions.

Resolution C021 would affirm a second reading and place Élie Naud on the calendar. Naud was a French Huguenot who came to New York in the 1700s after spending time as a galley slave. He became a member of Trinity Church Wall Street where for 15 years he worked with Black slaves and Native Americans to prepare them for baptism. He later became a member of Église du Saint-Esprit a French-speaking Episcopal parish in New York and he also started a school for poor children and the children of slaves.

St. Esprit’s rector the Rev. Nigel Massey who has served the church for 30 years spoke in favor of the resolution. Early in his tenure serving the church he read a former rector’s history of the parish and was struck by a sentence that has stayed with him ever since: “Our church can claim at least one who in another community would have been canonized as a confessor and missionary the saintly Élie Naud slave and servant of slaves.”

Parishioners Wendy Range and Joris Burmann also supported the resolution. Range described how the church annually commemorates Naud’s death on Sept. 7 with prayers in French and English at his grave in the Trinity Church Wall Street’s churchyard. Burmann who also is a postulant for Holy Orders in the Diocese of New York said Naud could serve as “an ecumenical bridge” both for individuals and for churches since many people have been members of other denominations before finding The Episcopal Church

Four people three from the Diocese of Hawai’i spoke in favor of A124 which would approve on first reading the addition of Liliʻuokalani of Hawai’i to the calendar. A confirmed member of the Cathedral of St. Andrew in Honolulu she was queen of the Hawai’ian Kingdom when her government was overthrown in 1893 by forces backed by the U.S. Navy. With her people facing such overwhelming force she chose not to fight to hold her crown and urged her people to respect her decision. She later was imprisoned.

The Rev. Steve Costa archdeacon of the Diocese of Hawai’i said that through her selfless service to her people and her surrender to prevent the deaths of others “she personified the beloved community long before we even thought of these things.” He also noted that Liliʻuokalani had composed what is known as the Queen’s Prayer or Ke Aloha o Ka Haku which still is sung by almost every church in Hawai’i on Sundays.

Two other Hawai’i deputies Mary Carpenter and Ryan Kusumoto also spoke in favor with Carpenter calling Liliʻuokalani “a model of the living native Hawaiian spirit for most of us Indigenous Pacifica people” while Kusumoto praised her selflessness in saving her people at the cost of her crown. “She stood down so her people could stand up” he said. “If she did not surrender to the American militant colonizers there may not be native Hawaiians here today.”

House of Deputies Vice President the Rev. Rachel Taber-Hamilton a member of Shacken First Nation said that recognizing Liliʻuokalani would be an important part of “the church’s overall commitment to reparation and reconciliation with the Indigenous peoples of every land in which our church had a part in weaponizing theology to justify genocide.”

The commemoration of Howard Thurman a Black pastor educator theologian and civil rights leader on first reading was proposed in C011 by the Diocese of California and in C012 by the Diocese of Northern California. The two resolutions differ only slightly in their language and Northern California deputy the Rev. James Richardson spoke in favor of both. The explanation accompanying each one describes well his “biography and influence on the civil rights movement which was enormous and the reasons for adding him to the calendar” Richardson said. He noted that while about 300 people currently are commemorated in The Episcopal Church’s calendar only about a dozen are African American and fewer still are African American theologians.

Thoma Lipartiani from the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe joined the meeting from the Republic of Georgia to support Resolution C020 adding Ilia Chavchavadze of Georgia on first reading. He described Chavchavadze as a public figure journalist publisher writer poet and human rights activist “who united Georgian society around three cornerstones of our nation – language homeland faith.” Chavchavadze was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1987 according to information provided with the resolution.

Turning to matters of liturgy James Frazer a member of St. Stephen and the Incarnation in Washington D.C. suggested a variety of changes to Resolution A114 which would authorize two expansive language versions of the Book of Common Prayer’s Eucharistic Prayer C. Frazer offered some changes in and reorganization of some proposed wording.

Deputies committee chair the Ven. Stannard Baker of Vermont asked Marty Wheeler Burnett associate professor of church music and director of chapel music at Virginia Theological Seminary to speak about two resolutions dealing with hymns and hymn texts – A130 and A131.

Burnett who also is a member of the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music said that A130 came out of a 2022 General Convention resolution mandating the commission to examine colonialist racist white supremacist imperialistic and nationalistic language in hymns. Focus groups since then have shown “widespread interest in and need for alternative versions of problematic texts” she said.

The resolution calls on the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music to develop and for Church Publishing Incorporated to publish a digital collection of alternative versions of hymn texts that congregations could use with permission of the diocesan bishop. Burnett noted that copyrights can be an issue on all hymn texts and any that the commission would include in this new collection would have permissions secured as needed.

She also spoke in favor of A131 which calls on the commission to develop a new supplement to the Hymnal 1982. “It has been 20 years since The Episcopal Church published a hymnal supplement and much has happened in 20 years” she said. “It is time.” Current hymnal supplements are Wonder Love and Praise (1997) and Voices Found (2003).

Among the resolutions that drew no testimony were second readings authorizing calendar additions of the consecration of Barbara Harris; Harriet Tubman; Simeon Bachos the Ethiopian eunuch; and Frederick Howden Jr.

Action will be taken on all these resolutions at a future meeting. They then will be considered by the 81st General Convention when it meets in Louisville Kentucky June 23-28.

Kira-kira seperti itulah kata yang keluar ketika kita pernah mengalami perjodohan namun pada akhirnya perjodohan itu gagal atau tidak langgeng. Jika Dilan berkata bahwa Rindu itu Berat maka orang yang mengalami perjodohan akan berkata bahwa dijodohkan itu berat.

Berat dalam arti karena membawa tidak hanya nama baik kita namun nama baik keluarga. Bahwa butuh proses cukup Panjang untuk bisa menyakinkan hati apakah menerima perjodohan itu atau bukan apalagi ini urusannya dengan masa depan dan untuk selamanya.

Dijodohkan akan berhasil ketika pasangan yang dijodohkan itu pas dengan kriteria pasangan yang kita mau. Namun jika bertolak belakang apalagi didasari tanpa adanya cinta perjodohan itu tentu tidak akan bahagia bahkan kemungkinan besar akan berpisah.

Saya sendiri termasuk bagian dari yang dijodohkan namun kemudian gagal. Saya dijodohkan oleh kawan saya kepada adiknya yang di usia 45 tahun belum pernah menikah. Karena tidak ada perempuan yang dikenal oleh teman saya maka saya dijodohkan dengan adiknya. Namun dalam perjalanan harus berakhir karena berbagai faktor.

Sebelum kita melangkah jauh dari perjodohan ke pernikahan alangkah baiknya kita memperhatikan terlebih dahulu beberapa hal :

Jangan cepat-cepat memutuskan menikah

Salah satu faktor kegagalan saya kemarin adalah saya di suruh buru-buru untuk menikah hanya karena faktor usia pasangannya dan karena dalam agama yang dianut tidak boleh pacaran lama-lama. Akhirnya dalam waktu satu bulan perjodohan dengan tujuh kali pertemuan kami disuruh menikah oleh pihak keluarganya. Padahal belum saling mengenal betul karakter dan sifat masing-masing.

Meskipun kita dijodohkan dan sudah mengenal orang yang menjodohkan kita namun kita janganlah mau ketika harus diburu-buru untuk ke tahap yang lebih serius apalagi kita hanya baru beberapa kali bertemu. Banyak hal yang harus kita pertimbangkan sebelum menerima keputusan untuk dinikahkan.

Kenali lebih dalam sifat pasangan yang dijodohkan

Maksudnya gimana caranya kalian tahu kalau orang yang kalian nikahi itu adalah satu-satunya kayak lagu Dewa 19 gitu lho.

Trus baru kemarin banget juga ada orang ngetwit lagi: Kalau seandainya kalian bertemu tulang rusuk atau soulmate kamu setelah menikah what would you do?

Maksudnya gimana kalau ternyata orang yang kamu nikahi adalah pilihan salah yang kamu telat nyadarnya. Terus ketemu orang yang benernya itu telat.

Ini maksudnya kayak adegan pembuka di film Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna gitu kali. Rani Mukerji yang udah pakai baju pengantin tiba-tiba kabur dulu ke belakang gedung ijab qobul terus ketemu Shah Rukh Khan.

Di situ Rani nanya ke Shah Rukh Khan “Gimana kalau kita nemu cinta sejati justru setelah pernikahan?”

Kalau di film itu sih jawaban Shah Rukh Khan adalah “Kamu nggak akan menemukannya kalau nggak mencarinya.”

Alias menemukan orang lain setelah kamu menikah itu bukan sesuatu yang coincidence. Kamu pasti niat dan setelah itu ada usaha buat mencarinya.

Saya… setuju sih. Soalnya saya nggak bisa bilang nggak sama Shah Rukh Khan.

Kalau dalam Islam sih rumusnya simpel. Seseorang yang menikah dengan kita itulah jodoh kita. Terkadang kita menganggapnya sebuah kebetulan untuk berjodoh dengan seseorang.

Tapi kata Prof Quraish Shihab dalam buku Pengantin Al-Quran “Kebetulan adalah pandangan/ucapan siapa yang tidak mengetahui sedang Allah Maha Mengetahui segala sesuatu; sebelum pada saat dan sesudah setiap kejadian besar atau kecil. Pengaturan Allah sudah selalu sesuai dengan ilmu-Nya Allah.”

Jadi kenapa ada jodoh yang kemudian bercerai? Ya karena jodoh ternyata tak harus sehidup semati. Ada jodoh yang memang tak langgeng mesti berpisah demi kebaikan agar bisa mendapat jodoh baru yang lebih membawa kebaikan dalam fase hidup yang selanjutnya.

Tapi begini. Saya pernah ada dalam dua posisi itu baik merasa nggak yakin dengan seseorang dan merasa yakin dengan seseorang. Perasaan yakin yang terakhir setidaknya membuat saya akhirnya menikah dengan suami saya yang sekarang.

Setelah membandingkan dua perasaan tersebut saya sampai pada kesimpulan bahwa seperti keputusan-keputusan lain yang kamu ambil dalam hidup keputusanmu untuk memilih seseorang sesungguhnya sangat bisa dirasionalisasi.

Saat pernah merasa tidak yakin dengan seseorang dalam diri saya timbul banyak kecemasan. Saya cemas akan hari-hari yang akan datang. Saya cemas jika dia tidak menyetujui banyak pilihan yang saya ambil.

Saya cemas jika pilihan-pilihan saya digugat. Saya cemas jika dia dapat melakukan agresi untuk menyetop pikiran-pikiran saya dan menggagalkan pilihan-pilihan saya.

Saat itu kecemasan saya bukan asumsi. Dalam banyak waktu saya berusaha keras untuk mengkomunikasikan hal tersebut. Biar lebih jelas saya coba beri contoh usaha untuk mengubah asumsi menjadi fakta itu.

Situasi 1: saya diterima sebagai editor di sebuah penerbitan buku agama yang tokoh ulamanya kontroversial.

Lalu saya bertanya kepadanya “Bolehkah saya mengambil pekerjaan itu? Lokasi kantornya di Pondok Cabe. Tidak terlalu jauh dari rumah tinggal yang kita rencanakan. Saya niatkan pekerjaan ini untuk belajar. Jika tak nyaman saya akan keluar.”

Dia tidak menjawab.

Situasi 2: saya sedang ada dalam kondisi writers’ block padahal tenggat pekerjaan semakin dekat. Saya mengeluh kepadanya “Aduh… nulis apa lagi ya pusing banget huhu.”

Dia lalu menjawab “Udahlah nggak usah nulis mulu. Toh nanti yang cari nafkah juga aku.”

Belakangan saya belajar kalau jawaban dia yang terakhir itu namanya gaslight.

Saya sedang pusing saya lelah dan mengeluhkan pekerjaan. Tapi kondisi dan perasaan saya itu tidak divalidasi dan justru dijawab dengan masculinity complex dari dirinya.

Ketidakjelasan demi ketidakjelasan itulah yang membentuk kecemasan saya yang kemudian berujung kepada perasaan tidak yakin dan berkeputusan untuk meninggalkannya.

Saat berusaha mengenal pasangan saya yang sekarang ternyata situasi mencekam seperti di atas tidak pernah terjadi.

Saya menyampaikan keinginan-keinginan saya dia bersedia untuk mendukung.

Saya menyampaikan bagaimana jika begini bagaimana jika begitu dia menyatakan bahwa dia tidak keberatan.

Clear. Terjawab.

Tentu saja tak selalu mudah. Saya beri contoh yang tak mudah itu juga agar berimbang.

Situasi: pasangan saya mulai mencemaskan pekerjaan saya yang berpindah-pindah kota dalam waktu yang berminggu-minggu. Ia cemas bagaimana jika kelak sudah menikah kami akan kekurangan waktu untuk bersama-sama.

Dia bahkan bilang saya bukan laki-laki yang cukup siap untuk ditinggal istri LDR bertahun-tahun untuk studi di luar negeri.

Kami mendiskusikan masalah tersebut. Sampai akhirnya menyepakati sebuah solusi yakni setiap kali keluar kota batas waktu pergi adalah satu minggu. Setelah satu minggu saya mesti pulang dulu minimal dua hari. Setelah ada di rumah sejenak saya boleh pergi untuk pekerjaan yang selanjutnya.

Apakah kesepakatan itu terlaksana? Kenyataannya tak selalu tepat. Setelah menikah terkadang saya tetap memfasilitasi pelatihan di luar Jawa lebih dari satu minggu.

Dan ternyata pasangan saya juga kini lebih gembira ketika saya sedang pergi karena artinya ia bisa jajan bebek goreng kesukaannya. Masalahnya kalau ada saya dia susah jajan karena saya bilang jangan boros-boros.

Namun setidaknya untuk saat itu kesepakatan-kesepakatan yang selalu punya jawaban membuat saya yakin untuk punya keputusan. Komunikasi efektif pada masa perkenalan dengan calon pasangan dapat meminimalisasi kecemasan yang hadir sebelum pernikahan.

Modal penting untuk menambah keyakinan adalah menyampaikan prinsip atau nilai yang kamu hormati kepadanya untuk mencari tahu apakah ia bisa menerima nilai tersebut.

Saya misalnya menyampaikan kepadanya perihal nilai kesetaraan manusia yang saya yakini. Saya menyampaikan bahwa saya tidak bisa menerima pandangan atau sikap diskriminasi atas nama agama abilitas kelas sosial maupun gender.

Dia menerima. Dan bersepakat untuk saling belajar bersama jika ada hal yang tak cukup kami mengerti.

Di hadapan penghulu dan wali saya menikah dengan perasaan yakin. Tak ada keraguan atau kecemasan seperti Rani Mukerji pada film Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. Meski begitu tentu saja perasaan yakin itu tetap saya hantarkan dengan doa serta tekad untuk selalu merawat hubungan pernikahan ini dengan sebaik-baiknya.

Jadi seberapa yakin kamu dengan pasanganmu yang sekarang?

CSCO,Cisco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vdHYvdGhlLWZsYXNoLXJldmVhbHMtZGV0YWlscy1hYm91dC1maW5hbC1jaXNjby1lcGlzb2RlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Flash Reveals Details About Final Cisco Episode,"Well we’ve all known this is coming for a while but it’s getting more real by the day. Cisco Ramon is leaving Team Flash. Which means in the real world that Carlos Valdes is leaving The Flash. No more Vibe. No more cool and nerdy t-shirts. No more awesome villain names. It’s a bummer.

To be fair it feels like The Flash has been teasing Cisco’s departure forever by now. Cisco took a hiatus from the team last season to go investigate post-Crisis on Infinite Earths anomalies and to visit Atlantis. The show has been trying out potential new Team Flash members in the form of Brandon McKnight’s generally delightful Chester P. Runk and Kayla Compton’s Allegra Garcia.

But recent developments have seen the prospect of Cisco’s permanent departure become increasingly real in recent weeks. With the love of Cisco’s life Kamila (Victoria Park) planning to leave Central City the scientist sometimes known as Vibe is going to join her. He even for the first time ever expressed frustration with his professional career at STAR Labs something he’s never done before.

So after all this buildup Valdes will finally get to take his final bow as Cisco in The Flash episode airing on June 8 “Good-Bye Vibrations.” The CW has released the official synopsis for the episode…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1jb21wYW5pZXMtbW9zdC1jYXNoLXJlc2VydmVzLTE4MjcwODIxMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Companies With The Most Cash Reserves In America,"In this article we are going to list the 15 companies with the most cash reserves in America. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Companies With The Most Cash Reserves In America.

The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the economy in a way that no one thought possible. Back when the economy of the United States crashed in 2008 - 2009 and the rest of the world followed suit few people thought they would face an even worse disaster in 202o just over a decade later. But that is what happened in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic which originated in China spread across the world leading to over 170 million cases as well more than 3.5 million deaths. These figures themselves are likely to be extremely understated and we will know the true impact of Covid-19 in the coming years.

As countries started imposing lockdowns to battle this virus for which they had no solution economies which are entirely dependent on lockdowns well not happening. Most industries faced significant losses as economies collapsed and most countries across the globe entered into either recessions or depressions. Many companies had to incur massive losses as well as major layoffs as demand for most industries fell and going at the same rate as pre-pandemic made no sense at all.

Even though as I mentioned most industries and companies suffered some actually came out of the pandemic smelling like roses. Take Tesla for example. The market cap of the company jumped astronomically during 2020 making even ordinary shareholders into millionaires and making Elon Musk the richest man in the world and the highest earning billionaire in 2020 as well as the richest man in the world for a while. Tech companies generally managed quite well in fact with many companies reporting higher sales and profits as demand for tech increased while more and more people continued to work from home.

Another example is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America. Apple Inc has nearly $200 billion in cash and marketable securities. One would think that with a large number of its stores closed Apple would have suffered dearly during the crisis. Fortunately for Apple Inc. (AAPL) shareholders the company did well during the past 12 months and AAPL shares performed even better. The company used some of its cash hoard to continue paying dividends and buy back shares. Apple Inc. should have used its massive cash hoard to snatch some EV and battery companies on the cheap.

15 companies with the most cash reserves in America

Story continues

Another technology stock that is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America is Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook Inc carries more than $60 billion in cash on its books and despite this huge buffer Facebook shares declined all the way down to $140 in March 2020. Mr. Market misjudged Facebook's potential for a few days but investors had a change of heart after a few weeks and Facebook shares returned more than 120% since its March 2020 lows. Unfortunately Facebook Inc's management didn't put its huge cash hoard into good use and take advantage of the opportunities.

Most of the companies that made our list of the 15 companies with the highest cash reserves in America are tech companies but you can also find non-technology stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Ford (NYSE:F) on our list. Costco was one of the beneficiaries of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic but JP Morgan Chase and Ford shares suffered large losses despite their cash reserves.

It would make sense that tech companies have massive cash reserves. Due to the high value of shares of these companies as well as the fact that their products are generally highly priced with significant margins these companies tend to have a lot of surplus cash on hand. However having a lot of excess cash can also be often considered to be a failure on the part of the company to have the cash simply lying around when it could be put to better use say on investing activities or to pay off debts which would allow the company to save significant money on interest payments. On the other hand having too little cash can give the signal that the company has liquidity issues and can also be perceived negatively by investors and shareholders. Therefore there is a fine balance to maintain one which many companies are able to maintain while others are not.

However in the era of Covid where the economy needs significant boosts it is frustrating many people including Wall Street that companies are sitting on massive piles of cash and yet are refusing to utilize it. As I mentioned earlier companies can use it for investing activities as well as acquisitions or by returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends which would gain them goodwill in an unprecedented year. Another option is buyback of shares from shareholders though detractors argue that this is simply a short term boost for investors while resulting in a long term effect on the health of a company.

Of course the simple reason would be that this isn't the best time really to spend money. The market is uncertain the economy will take a while to recover and while there is optimism on the horizon with vaccines being administered it is still a long haul process and not an immediate one. Hence companies are a bit cautious in investing money. Further the biggest companies in the world are also really big on acquisitions with Apple acquiring a hundred companies over the last 6 months. That means an acquisition every three to four weeks. Furthermore tech companies famous for having a lot of cash on hand are also known for sitting on said cash. And even though this doesn't mean that these companies are not spending cash at all it's just that many analysts believe that these companies are not doing as much as they do.

Coming up with the list of companies with the largest cash reserves in America was not an easy task. Search on the internet and you'll generally find tech companies and even then those articles are often outdated. Most people want to know the reserves that companies have now one year after the Covid-19 pandemic rather than back in 2019 or 2018. Hence we selected the biggest companies from the Fortune Global 500 list and focused particularly on the tech industry as it is true that these companies tend to have the most cash. We have selected the latest quarterly reports for each company and scoured the balance sheet to find out the cash reserves that these companies own. Due to the high liquidity of marketable securities we have considered them among cash equivalents as well though most other types of investments including long term investments have not been considered. Together these companies hold more than $1.1 trillion in cash alone which is truly an astonishing amount. So without further ado let's take a look at the companies which combined have more cash than most countries in the world starting with number 15:

Customers and riders who signed up after 14 January when the incident took place were not affected the company said in a statement.

Lebanon: Lebanese expats’ personal data exposed abroad

A few months before Lebanon’s general elections in May 2018 Lebanese embassies in the UEA and the Netherlands exposed personal data of Lebanese citizens living abroad making it accessible to unauthorised users and third parties.

In the UAE embassy officials sent an email to Lebanese nationals living in the country with an attached spreadsheet including personal details of more than 5000 Lebanese citizens who had registered to vote in the elections.

A similar email with a spreadsheet containing personal information of Lebanese registered voters in the Netherlands was sent by the local embassy to more than 200 recipients.

According to the NGO personal information in the UAE and Netherlands spreadsheets included voters’ full name parents’ names sex date of birth religion marital status and address.

The data fiasco happened shortly after the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants (MFA) had been using cookies to track more than 90000 users who used the ministry’s website to register to vote online.

Turkey: Government database hacked

In April 2016 personal data — including full names address national ID number parents’ full names and date of birth — belonging to about 50 million Turkish citizens (two thirds of the country’s population) was leaked and posted online on a website called the Turkish Citizenship Database.

Transport and Communication Minister Binali Yildirim confirmed at the time that the breach appeared to date back to at least 2010. He added that the information was taken from electoral records that the government shares with political parties prior to elections. However Tuncay Besikci a computer forensics expert at consultancy firm PwC told Reuters “he believed the data was taken from the government’s official Population Governance Central Database in or around 2009 and later illegally sold on to firms that dealt in asset foreclosures.”

Qatar: QNB sees sensitive financial details published online

In April 2016 Qatar National Bank (QNB) one of the largest financial institutions in the MENA region was hit by a severe cyberattack which revealed names PINs and passwords of a large number of customers. The leaked data was posted online to the freedom-of-expression website Cryptome.

Doha News reported that the breached information also included internal corporate files and the bank details telephone numbers and dates of birth of a number of Al-Jazeera journalists supposed members of the ruling al-Thani family and government and defence officials.

Although the authenticity of all of the leaked data couldn’t be verified a number of well-known Qatari government and media personalities told Reuters that their account details published online were correct.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced back and crossed the 34000 mark once again but remained below the recent peak.

Putting an end to speculation AT&T and WarnerMedia signed a $43-billion pact to combine the latter’s entertainment and sports assets with the global leisure business of Discovery in one of the largest deals in recent times that would create a new company.

In another tech deal the cloud communications platform Twilio agreed to acquire Seattle-based messaging app Zipwhip for about $850 million. Continuing its acquisition spree professional services firm Accenture bought management consultancy Homburg & Partner. The latest to join the M&A bandwagon was Snap which is buying AR display maker WaveOptics for more than $500 million.

A peek behind the curtain in the NFL is always exhilarating. It is the league where most things are considered state secrets with entire primetime rollouts for simple events like schedule announcements.

But there is no NFL fixture that contains more secrets than the NFL Draft. Each year the seven-round event consistently brings the rumor mill to its apex. As a result it is always seen as a noteworthy event each time a franchise lets some of its secrets out even if just a few.

The Jacksonville Jaguars are the latest team to let their fan base and the NFL at large what they thought of some of the top members of the 2021 draft class. In the latest episode of the team-produced video series 'The Hunt' (which is excellently done) the Jaguars revealed draft boards that showed how the team viewed several first- and second-round prospects including some of their own later picks. You can start watching at the 6:50 mark to see their grades.

Of course it is unknown what the grades exactly mean or by what scale the Jaguars use. We don't have full knowledge of exactly how the Jaguars see the players their strengths and weaknesses and how they would have best projected to Jacksonville.

With that said we do get to see how the Jaguars stacked certain prospects against each other. Let's start with the first round.

Screenshot via Jaguars' YouTube channel.

You can see the Jaguars' grades on each of their first-round selections: Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence and running back Travis Etienne. Lawrence was selected by the Jaguars at No. 1 overall while the team would reunite him with Etienne at No. 25 overall.

Lawrence was given an 8.0 draft grade which is the highest of any grades we see handed out by the Jaguars in the video. It is safe to say they saw Lawrence as a special prospect (with a projected 4.60 40-yard-dash which is nothing to sneeze at).

Then we see Etienne with a 7.0 draft grade which isn't too far below an 8.0 all things considered. We don't know how the Jaguars scale their grades of course but it is clear how high they were on the most productive back in ACC history.

""We have quarterback that we think has a high high ceiling two very high character guys that fit into the culture here. We’re real excited real excited"" Jaguars general manager Trent Baalke said after the draft's first round.

“Well I think if you go back to his college film I think you see he’s an explosive player can multi-align can detach can come out of the backfield. So he offers a tremendous amount of versality in the pass game as well as that explosive play-making ability that you covet"" Baalke continued about Etienne.

But then we saw quite a bit more from the Jaguars -- especially when it came to the first round and how a few fellow AFC teams selected.

As you can see above the Jaguars had the following grades on these first-round prospects.

No. 2 overall QB Zach Wilson: 7.0

No. 6 overall WR Jaylen Waddle: 8.0

No. 14 overall OL Alijah Vera-Tucker: 7.5

No. 18 overall EDGE Jaelan Philips: 7.5

There are numerous interesting threads to follow here the most interesting being that New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson is the lowest prospect graded of all six players.

Again we don't know the Jaguars' scale or what a 7.0 can truly mean. It bears reminding that these are just six of 32 first-round grades so Wilson undoubtedly had a higher grade than some others picked behind him. It does show however that the Jaguars didn't see Wilson as a player who was on Lawrence's level as a prospect.

""We spent a good probably a month—we kind of had ideas but it got—there were some good Zoom calls with those other two quarterbacks. Very good players I’m glad to see. High high-end character guys very good leaders tough competitors but we feel good about our quarterback"" Jaguars head coach Urban Meyer said after the first round.

It is also interesting to see the kind of grade the Jaguars had on Miami Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle who spent much of his final season at Alabama injured. Waddle was given an 8.0 grade the same as Lawrence. Now an 8.0 grade as a receiver and an 8.0 as a quarterback are two things that will be weighed and valued very differently but is noteworthy the Jaguars were so high on Waddle.

Then you have the Jaguars' next several picks. The Jaguars took Georgia cornerback Tyson Campbell at No. 33 Stanford offensive tackle Walker Little at No. 45 Syracuse safety Andre Cisco at No. 65 and USC defensive tackle Jay Tufele at No. 106 in the fourth round.

The Jaguars had Campbell and Cisco with the same grade though it makes sense they waited until round three to take Cisco due to the fact that he suffered an ACL injury last fall. With that said it isn't surprising to see their high mark on the third-rounder considering what they said about him following this draft.

""I expect Tyson Campbell will be an instant impact in a lot of areas — special teams and also rolling through the secondary in the back corner but also nickel"" Meyer said.

""Walker Little is going to push our tackles. Our tackles have to play better. I like how hard they’re working I like their talent level but the best thing you can do is create a little competition and I’ve made that clear with Walker.

""Andre Cisco is one of my favorite players on the board. He had a tough knee injury the good thing is a very clean injury an ACL and that was it. There’s already videotape of him training and going. He should be ready and cleared to go. You watch him when he’s healthy and it’s hard to say he’s not the best safety in the draft. Trevon from TCU excellent player as well but this guy from day one we thought he was as good as there is.""

The Jaguars have nine new members of their franchise thanks to the 2021 NFL Draft. We will see moving forward just how much the Jaguars got right about this class but we now at least know how Meyer Baalke and their scouts viewed some of this year's top players."
C,Citigroup,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYmV0dGVybWFya2V0cy5vcmcvaW1wYWN0L2pvaG4tcmVlZC1jaXRpYmFuay1maW5hbmNpYWwtcmVmb3JtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Reed Citibank & Financial Reform,"John Reed started at Citibank in 1965 becoming Chairman and CEO in 1984. He lead the bank when it merged with the Travelers Group (including Travelers Insurance and the Salomon Brothers investment bank) in 1998 to form the universal bank called Citigroup where he was Chairman and CEO from 1998 to 2000. That merger was the de facto end of the Glass-Steagall provisions of the Banking Act of 1933 which (in relevant part) prohibited the combination of traditional deposit taking banks with high risk capital markets activities of investment banks.

Reed reviewed this history in an insightful keynote address at an event co-sponsored by Better Markets on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Dodd Frank Act on July 21 2020 which also featured former President Obama and other luminaries. Reed’s remarks are available here.

The repeal of Glass Steagall in 1999 ushered in the supersizing of already too-big-to-fail banks like Citigroup and greatly contributed to the global financial crash of 2008 as detailed in this Fact Sheet. Citigroup was at the core of causing and spreading that financial crash. It was the recipient of one of the largest government bailouts in history and was the only major bank not to repay the TARP money it received (see “Wall Street’s Six Biggest Bailed-Out Banks” Better Markets April 9 2019 n. 80 and accompanying text).

After that crash Reed was the only senior executive of a too-big-to-fail bank to genuinely reflect on the financial crash its causes and his role in it. After doing so he concluded that the arguments for and claimed benefits of repealing Glass Steagall — and for the combination of traditional and investment banking — lacked merit. More remarkable he broke the Wall Street code of silence whereby Wall Street executives never admitted mistakes never took responsibly and never seriously discussed how to change the industry if it threatened their profits or most importantly their bonuses.

As early as April of 2008 (shortly after the collapse of the Bear Stearns investment bank) Reed told a reporter from the Financial Times that the merger of Citibank with Traveler’s Group that create Citigroup had been a mistake saying:

“The stockholders have not benefited; the employees certainly have not benefited and I don’t think the customers have benefited because our franchises are weaker than they have been.”

In October of 2009 Reed wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times supporting Paul Volcker’s push for regulations that would separate deposit taking institutions from those that deal primarily in capital markets (which would later be included in modified form in the Dodd Frank Act in a provision known as the “Volcker Rule.”)

In November 2009 Reed went much further. In an interview with Bloomberg he apologized for his role in creating the conditions that enabled the 2008 financial crisis and agreed that the major Wall Street banks are too big to fail. Reed said that Congress’ overhaul of the US financial system should ban deposit taking institutions from engaging in equities and fixed-income trading calling for the reinstating the principal provisions of Glass-Steagall.

On February 4 2010 Reed testified before the Senate Banking Committee on the implications of the Volcker Rule for financial stability. Famously Reed told the committee that the merger of Citi and the Travelers Group had “created a monster.” Reed testified that based on his experience the corporate culture that thrives in firms operating in capital markets like Travelers did with Salomon Brothers should not be allowed at depository institutions and that the banking and financial systems would be stronger if those functions were separated.

On March 24 2010 Reed was interviewed by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) and was asked to expand on his remarks to the Senate Banking Committee. Reed explains that two major cultural shifts transformed Citi after the merger. First he noted that throughout the 1990s capital markets activities became much more important and shareholders became increasingly focused on stock price as a metric for measuring executive performance. Reed stated his belief that this shifted the focus within Citi and other traditional banks away from serving customers and towards the reckless pursuit of profit.

Second traders at investment banks like Salomon Brothers introduced a risk-seeking attitude and over reliance on quantitative risk assessments which were highly dependent on assumptions and projections by those very same risk-seeking investment bankers. Unsurprisingly those risk assessments were consistently overly optimistic to a material degree compounded by traders increasing their exposure to supposedly safe AAA rated assets. Regulators then deferred to banks’ risk assessments which enabled the industry to de-capitalize itself. As Reed stated:

“I think [the regulators] probably made the mistake of taking a look at what is quote called ‘risk-adjusted capital’ end quote and since the securities were in theory highly rated they presumably didn’t think that they attracted much in the way of capital requirements. This was bad logic.”

Reed continued to speak candidly about the need for financial reform and the financial industry’s mistakes. In 2012 he spoke at length about the political processes that lead to the repeal Glass-Steagall. Reed describes an industry that had become absolutely convinced that Glass-Steagall was either unnecessary or actively harmful failing completely to seriously consider the risks that would inevitably be created by combining gigantic traditional banks with very large investment banks.

In a November 2015 Op Ed published by the Financial Times Reed rejected the concept of universal banking saying:

“I think the lessons of Glass-Steagall and its repeal suggest that the universal banking model is inherently unstable and unworkable. No amount of restructuring management change or regulation is ever likely to change that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDUvbW92ZS1mcm9tLWJhbmtpbmctdG8tY29ycG9yYXRlLWRldmVsb3BtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Hong Kong banker who switched to a corporate for the 'best of both worlds',"There has been unprecedented demand in Hong Kong for senior bankers with expertise in the technology and healthcare sectors.

Demand for talent is being partly fueled by the number of bankers moving to become chief financial officers of corporate clients – this year alone Vijay Karwal Nomura’s head of healthcare investment banking Chao Lu previously Citigroup’s head of Asia healthcare investment banking Jeremy Choy the head of technology mergers and acquisitions at HSBC and Yang Ruo a managing director in Citigroup’s TMT team have all made the switch.

A big factor in the moves is the opportunity to help build a company and in some cases help steer it to a public market listing. This plays to a banker’s strengths in corporate finance plus there is considerable upside in terms of remuneration.

Senior bankers are well paid but they can earn multiples of their salary by having skin in the game and guiding a company to an initial public offering.

But not all bankers want to join corporates and not all moves work out. That’s because taking a CFO role means a banker goes from working on multiple deals and being in the flow of transactions to taking a more strategic role.

Karwal has managed to get the best of both worlds with a new dual role. This week he was appointed CFO of biopharmaceutical company AffaMed Therapeutics based in Shanghai. At the same time he was also appointed operating partner of Singapore headquartered CBC Group (formerly C-Bridge Capital) a founding shareholder and funding partner in AffaMed.

CBC is one of the most active investors in the healthcare sector in Asia and this additional role means Karwal can execute his CFO duties for AffaMed while remaining in Hong Kong at the coal-face of dealmaking. “Bankers are so used to being involved in many different projects and they may lose that if they move to a corporate. But this role gives me the best of both worlds. Whereas AffaMed is the core focus and responsibility I’ll continue to be able to leverage my network and experience to support CBC in sourcing deal-flow” Karwal told eFinancialCareers.

Karwal has moved between banking and the corporate world before during his 25-year career. Prior to joining Nomura as Head of Healthcare Investment Banking for the Asia (ex-Japan) region in 2018 he was Asia Pacific Chief Development Officer as well as General Manager of China operations for DaVita Inc the international provider of kidney care services. He joined DaVita from Royal Bank of Scotland where he was the Asia Head of Consumer Retail & Healthcare coverage and before that was Head of Healthcare Banking in North America at ABN AMRO.

Equity markets were flying high through the first four months of the year as economists played a version of “can you top this?” by jacking up their predictions for 2021 U.S. economic growth to the highest since the first half of the Reagan administration. The latest surveys have gross domestic product expanding 6.5% as more of the economy reopens and Congress passes sweeping fiscal stimulus measures. In December those forecasts averaged around 3.70%.

Now though investors might want to ask whether those lofty estimates are too good to be true.

Former presidential and now NYC mayoral candidate Andrew Yang got put on the spot by Ziwe Fumudoh for an upcoming episode of Ziwe and Yang kept it as political as possible.

“I listened to a lot of hip-hop during like the 90s and 2000s” Yang said when asked about listening to rap music. After Ziwe presses him on giving a specific name he centers on two of New York’s greats Nas and JAY-Z.

“What’s your favorite Jay-Z song?” Ziwe asks Yang. “I mean he’s a New Yorker.”

Yang pauses for a moment and looks around unable to determine an answer for himself. He audibly asks “What is my favorite JAY-Z song?” before the clip abruptly cuts.

The awkward moment is the latest for Yang who continues to make his case to be the next mayor for New York. Yang’s agreement to join Ziwe on the show comes only days after she pitched the idea to him on Twitter. In a leaked clip ahead of the interview airing on Sunday (May 23) Yang ultimately revealed his choice going with “Numb/Encore” from Hov’s collaboration effort with Linkin Park. His backup choice? “Niggas In Paris” from Watch The Throne although Yang swiftly referred to the song as “Ninjas In Paris” as to not offend anyone.

For Citi Malaysia — with a new chief in the driving seat and a major structural shift on the cards — what is the game plan?

In The Edge Malaysia weekly this week Usman Ahmed sheds light on what is ahead for Citi Malaysia in his first exclusive interview as its CEO.

The veteran banker has had to grapple managing a corporation in the midst of a tough operation landscape that has been upended by the Covid-19 pandemic — just like all leaders are facing globally — and on top of that Usman’s entry into Malaysia also happened just days after an Emergency was declared in the country.

Additionally just 2.5 months into the top job here effective Feb 1 a major shift in business direction was announced that will impact Citi Malaysia structurally putting the spotlight on the new chief and the banking group.

“I’d say it’s definitely the most eventful first quarter I’ve had in a new role!” Usman says laughing.

He talks about Citi Malaysia’s strategies and plans for the way forward in the midst of a continued “complex” macro environment globally as well as locally coupled with an eventual structural shift.

Against this backdrop Usman insists that Citi Malaysia’s mission and strategy remain the same — that is focused on serving customers well today across all client segments.

In the interview Usman also addressed the topic on everyone’s minds when it comes to Citi today — the asset divestment of sale of retail banking assets in 13 markets across the Asia-Pacific region Europe and the Middle East including Malaysia.

“With respect to the announcements that have been made it’s a lot of work right now we are focused on making sure that first and foremost we are maintaining full-fledged consumer banking operations as normal... We want to see that our employees customers are fully taken care of during and after the process has concluded” Usman says.

“We remain strongly committed to the country…. We remain focused on ensuring a completely normal consumer banking operation it has never been any other way since we made the announcement... But I think people sometimes perceive that things might change immediately... There is no change” he assures.

The photographs in this publication are taken from the parking garage located to the south of the hotel portion of the entire project along with being to the south to the skyline. The hotel is located two blocks to the north of Citizens Bank Park in the Sports Complex District in South Philadelphia.

Mostly coming into view is the cluster of the tallest skyscrapers that make up the Philadelphia skyline. The view also stretches all the way from West Philadelphia to Old City including the Camden skyline in the distance. The FMC Tower stands extremely dominant as well. The Comcast Technology Center is the tallest of the bunch at 1121 feet tall. The William Penn statue on top of City Hall pops out above the crown of One South Broad Street near several developments rising around Broad Street.

Observing progress on multiple projects the tallest tower that has made substantial progress is the Arthaus condominium which will stand 542 feet tall. The Laurel Rittenhouse Square will rise taller still to 599 feet visible in front of Two Commerce Center as the tower nears the top of the structure. Smaller projects such as the Riverwalk towers are also making good progress where the south tower is about to top out.

When the local government banned liquor Pemberton was forced to improvise a replacement beverage on the fly. The result was Coca-Cola which went on to become the most popular soft drink on Earth closely followed by similar US sodas.

Their triumph was so complete that the Soviet Union once paid for a shipment of Pepsi in old battleships briefly making PepsiCo the sixth most powerful navy on Earth. Fortunately they didn't need to invade anywhere having already conquered the world. But while Coke and its imitators have achieved market dominance in almost every country not actively under trade embargo there are a few scattered pockets of resistance.

What kind of mystical soda ambrosia could possibly outsell Coke a drink so delicious that nobody even minded when they took the cocaine out? For an answer we turned to Scotland a small country east of Ireland and north of nothing in particular where a rust-themed concoction called Irn-Bru has outsold every other soda since at least 1947.

4 The Taste Is Impossible To Describe

Now we know what you're thinking: To defeat Coke Pepsi and Mr. Pibb Irn-Bru must have a truly amazing taste. And it does it's just that it's not technically possible to describe that taste using words. It definitely has flavoring but it all adds up to an actual flavor found nowhere else in nature and ideally nowhere else in science either. It's definitely sweet and there's a faint hint of metal somewhere in there but beyond that it's like trying to describe Cthulhu to a disinterested hummingbird. The English language just isn't equipped for what we're trying to do here. Finlay McWalter Irn Bru: They Shouldn’t Have Sent A Poet. Advertisement But we're not quitters so here goes. Basically imagine one of those experiments where someone leaves a penny in a glass of Sprite for a month to see if it dissolves. Now imagine drinking the resulting liquid. Irn-Bru tastes almost exactly like watching some other guy do that. Americans tend to describe it as tasting like bubblegum or cough syrup but that's not quite right either. It tastes more like licking your braces after chewing gum for eight hours. It tastes like cough syrup on your heart surgeon's breath. It's perhaps the only soft drink in history to be flavored exclusively like itself suggesting an invention in some sort of time loop. If anything Irn-Bru's indescribable nature is a point of pride in Scotland. We're talking about a brand that for years advertised itself as flavored like a bridge strut. Social media users have proudly described it as tasting like a ""rusty nail watered by the tears of Scottish children"" and ""a bubbling highland stream mixed with casual violence."" We'd describe it more like discovering the world's last can of Fanta 30 years after the apocalypse. It tastes like finding a loose rivet in your pack of jawbreakers and powering through it anyway. It tastes like dental tools if the dentist was a double agent for Big Cavity. It tastes like being beaten by a Candy Kingdom loan shark. It tastes like Scotland. It tastes great.

3 It Was Advertised Like The Mountain Dew Of The 1900s The original Iron Brew was actually a vanilla-flavored soda invented in New York and marketed as the ""Ideal American Drink."" America politely disagreed and Iron Brew quickly went out of business but the name was soon copied by various bottlers and imitators. The A.G. Barr company of Scotland started selling their own version of Iron Brew in 1899 although sales were initially limited by the fact that its delivery carts could only get 10 miles from the factory each day before the horses got tired. Its original target market was Glasgow steelworkers a hardy bunch who had proved resistant to Barr's earlier sodas like ""Wee McGregor's Brew"" and ""Lil Good Boy's Fancy-Lad Treat"" (we made one of those up but won't say which). The new Iron Brew promised to be an iron-flavored soda for their iron-flavored lives. Motherwell Times This looks like a guy jumping out of a stargate and the Avengers of 1900 are ready to take him on. Advertisement As a result the soda was advertised basically like turn-of-the-century Mountain Dew. Barr sourced celebrity endorsements from the Highland Games the Edwardian Scottish equivalent of the X-Games where large men in larger mustaches competed to throw boulders around the place. An early spokesman was famous tosser Alex Munro who competed to hurl a large tree as far as possible in an event called the caber toss. Early Barr ads featured Munro in a loincloth declaring Iron Brew ""a strengthening and invigorating beverage ... a splendid tonic while training and an excellent pick-me-up after a tussle"" which nowadays scans like a bot trying to stealth market a Latvian energy drink on Grindr. Advertisement Shortly after signing up Munro Iron Brew landed its most famous endorsement yet when it signed up legendary strongman Donald Dinnie who had become a Scottish hero in 1860 when he carried two boulders across a bridge outside Aberdeen. The boulders are still there (they weigh 733 pounds combined) and lifting the ""Dinnie Stones"" is still a rite of passage for strongmen. By the time Iron Brew came calling Dinnie was pushing 70 and living in near-poverty scraping a living with an act where he hoisted a table on his back while dancers performed a Highland jig on it. So he was more than happy to appear in ads in a kilt declaring Barr's Iron Brew the perfect recipe for achieving ""athletic fame."" via Wiki Commons Dinnie's other great feat was lifting all his giant-ass medals. Advertisement Truth-in-advertising regulations caused a name change to Irn-Bru in 1946 (Irn-Bru does contain iron but doesn't meet the technical definition of brewing). However the tough-as-nails image continued to be a theme in Irn-Bru advertising. And we do mean literally as tough as nails -- for many years the brand's slogan was ""Irn-Bru: Made In Scotland From Girders."" That's right Coke is apparently second best in Scotland because it just hasn't made enough effort to associate itself with oxidizing metal. Advertisement Advertisement

2 Trump ""Effectively Declared War On Scotland"" By Banning Irn-Bru

Whatever you think of his politics noted Diet Coke lover Donald Trump is renowned for his charm and tact making lifelong friends wherever life's journey takes him. So you'd be surprised to learn that he's not very popular in Scotland. The problems actually started long before he became president when he showed up promising to build the ""world's greatest golf course"" in a small coastal village near Aberdeen. The local council politely declined the offer due to environmental damage only to be overruled by the Scottish government which cited Trump's promise to invest $1.25 billion and create six thousand permanent jobs. Naturally this turned out to be code for Advertisement less than $50 million in investment and about 95 jobs. Cabro Aviation Eh they probably spent $500 million on that car park alone. Meanwhile locals who refused to sell their land to the golf course complained that Trump had bought up all the surrounding land and built walls around their houses then sent them the bills for the walls. At least one couple refused to pay declaring that ""Mexico won't pay"" and that they wouldn't either and began flying a Mexican flag whenever Trump visited. Another neighbor took to flying a ""Hillary for President"" flag after Trump attacked his ""slumlike"" home. Meanwhile Trump also had a major squabble with the originally supportive Scottish government after they announced plans to build a wind farm nearby. And then things went from bad to worse when Trump did the unthinkable and banned Irn-Bru. Advertisement Advertisement In 2018 the news broke that Trump's golf course was denying every Scotsman's natural-born rights by refusing to serve Irn-Bru to guests. Apparently the drink had been banned entirely after the Trump Organization became concerned it could stain their precious carpets (unlike cowardly non-staining sodas Irn-Bru sears itself onto every available surface with the intensity of battleship paint). General manager Ralph Porciani squealed to the local paper that ""We can't have it staining when to replace the ballroom carpet would be 500000 pounds alone."" Naturally all hell broke loose. Mike Pennington Scotland quickly deployed its legendary Bru Battalion. A local lawyer called it ""effectively a declaration of war on Scotland."" The Guardian suggested that Trump had withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal in the same week as ""a crude feint intended to divert attention from the deep insult to our national drink."" Meanwhile Scottish Twitter users described Trump as ""an absolute zoomer"" over the decision which we're choosing to interpret as an insult. Either way the decision was the final straw for many Scots who declared that they liked their American presidents just the way they didn't like their sodas: not orange.

It remains important though to stay cognizant of members of local communities that are still struggling with food insecurity issues.

It’s times like these when the industry needs to come together to support its neighbors. Thankfully Restaurant Depot Rochester (NY) has teamed up with charity BluePrint of Geneva NY to do just that.

The nonprofit organization BluePrint Geneva founded in 2016 has been working nonstop to support their local community with work in housing insecurity food drives tax preparation composting and more. “When BluePrint asked me last year if I’d be interested in creating a program to provide meals for the people in our community it was a no brainer” said upstate chef and now BluePrint board member Samantha Buyskes. “It was such an incredible opportunity to give back to the same community that’s given me so much.” Now Buyskes and BluePrint are taking it one step further with the help of the restaurant industry’s cash & carry icon Restaurant Depot to battle food insecurity.

During the month of April Restaurant Depot Rochester and BluePrint have collaborated to provide 75 comprehensive boxed grocery donations as a complete surprise to families in the Geneva NY community.

Buyskes is no stranger to helping those in need. As a chef in the Finger Lakes region for over twenty years she’s worked nonstop to combat food insecurity. “I’ve always had a passion for giving back in a constructive way and my work in myriad organizations charities dinners and drives has allowed me to do just that. On an even greater note my role as a Chef allows me to dictate exactly what those in need will be receiving. This means not only do we provide food we provide nutritious items that would normally be very expensive or scarce. Many hungry families need to resort to unhealthy products or fast food due to monetary constraints so our aim is to minimize this as best we can.”

“We’re incredibly excited to work with Samantha on this Saturday soup kitchen” said General Manager of Restaurant Depot Rochester Burt Diferio. “We came up with a list of items that Samantha deemed necessary for the community including things like flour sugar cereal and other stable shelf-life items. The goal for each of these boxes is for the recipients to be able to support their families for a substantial amount of time without having to make compromises when it comes to health or money. Samantha will then take these boxes to a storage facility where they will await delivery. We’ve also given Samantha a grant of ten thousand dollars for which she can use to continue supporting her food drive and soup kitchen organization.

Under the guidance of Restaurant Depot president Stanley Fleischman the BluePrint Geneva program most recent development in ‘Depot’s long history of community support. “Our goal has always been to take care of our customers to the best of our ability so they in turn can do the same for theirs. We’re all about finding solutions for people particularly in the midst of the pandemic” said Diferio. Businesses everywhere have suffered due to the scarcity of many key ingredients and products forcing operators to take hits to revenue and compromise in other facets of their business.

“The entire foodservice industry has been hit incredibly hard during this pandemic” Diferio explained. “Many of the restaurants in our community have struggled to stay open and sadly some of them have closed for good. Our mission here at Restaurant Depot now and always has been to help the independent restaurant owner succeed by offering the right products at the right prices to our customers. We are here for our customers 7 days a week and we have no minimums so a small operation or one who is slowly re-opening can come and pick up only what they need when they need it.”

“During these hard times we also have our public community to think about and those who are dealing with food insecurities. Over the past year Restaurant Depot has been working hand in hand with food banks and community organizations all over the nation to get food to people who need it. Teaming up with Chef Samantha and BluePrint seemed like a perfect fit for the Rochester Community.”

One of her arguments is why girl children - unlike boys - are raised to aspire to marriage as if it was the end-goal in life … to believe that marriage is a big achievement that a woman must aspire for. And as a result unmarried women no matter how successful are seen as lacking … ‘successful; but…!’

As a parent to a girl-child myself I am cognizant of the gender stereotypes that my child may pick as she goes through her daily life. Recently I was troubled while reading her a story book. She loves the character “Cinderella”. While at the mall one day she saw a Cinderella book - and wanted it.

Both I and my daughter were excited; first for having a new bedtime story for that night and secondly for me I was going to learn about the Cinderella story for the first time. Well I suppose it is still debatable whether being born and raised in a village without the luxury of reading such books as Cinderella is an advantage or a disadvantage.

So I read the story for my daughter that night and I did not like it. In fact I had a hard time reading some parts of the story to her. What I got from the story was that there was a girl named Cinderella’s and her end goal in life was to marry a prince.

And to win this ‘big achievement’ of marrying a prince it was battle between her and her stepsisters orchestrated by her stepmother. I am yet to read a children’s book about a group of brothers competing under the leadership of their father to win the affection of a girl!

These stories may seem trivial harmless … but these are at the core of the women empowerment agenda the whole world advocates for today. The questions I asked myself after reading the story was what did my daughter actually learn from it? She may have learnt that there is some prince out there in the world and she is going to be very lucky indeed must work hard to get married to. But in today’s world where we strive to have relationships based on equality rather than the man supplying and the woman receiving is this really what we want to instil in our girl children?

The “prince” character can be considered a figure of speech representing a man who is wealthy established coming from a wealthy family basically able to supply all the needs of a woman and the woman can choose whether to work for her own earnings or not.

Children literature including fantasy fairy tales like Cinderella come with ideologies about gender race and class. In fact a 2017 study named “Gender Stereotypes in Fantasy Fairy Tales: Cinderella” revealed that the literature children consume may negatively contribute in the creation of their values and attitudes and impact their viewpoints of the real life. The researchers found that in such fairy tales the main emphasis is on the importance of beauty and attractiveness as they are usually rewarded.

And this beauty is mainly ‘as perceived by a male character’. Also beauty in such stories is portrayed a certain way: tall white long hair etc. But is this the definition of beauty that matches our children’s realities? What about values such as kindness hard work and honesty?

In summary parents and caretakers must play an active role in filtering the information consumed by children.

Digital media has put mechanisms such as parental control to prevent children from consuming adult content; but it goes beyond that – not all children content is good for children. We must be aware of the values and beliefs that the material instils in children and be selective accordingly.

But Colgate is now giving you another reason to smile with the launch of a vegan-certified toothpaste that comes in a 'first-of-its-kind' recyclable toothpaste tube which you can toss in the blue bin after the last squeeze.

Colgate

It has been under development since five years and is part of the company's efforts to have all of its products use recyclable packaging by 2025.

The new tubes that pack Colgate's new Naturals toothpaste range are made using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) the plastic used to make milk jugs and other recyclable plastic bottles.

It's important to note this tube--and plastics in general--aren't biodegradable. But these recyclable tubes are made out of #2 HDPE plastic which can be re-processed into all kinds of new things including construction materials and new packaging.

To stop billions of toothpaste tubes from ending up in landfills we shared our recyclable tube technology with all the other toothpaste makers. Through sharing we hope to initiate a global shift to recyclable toothpaste tubes. Together we can make a difference. #EarthDay 🌎♻️ pic.twitter.com/0j5ncvVcyg — Colgate Smile (@Colgate) April 22 2021

But why did it take five years for the oral-care brand to make this recyclable tube?

Colgate said it thought it could use a commonly recycled type of plastic called a ""high-density polyethylene"" (HDPE) for the new tube but it discovered that it's not squeezable enough for toothpaste.

It's so-called ""eureka moment"" came when it compiled several grades of HDPE material in a toothpaste tube. That correct combination ""allows people to comfortably squeeze out all the toothpaste protects the integrity of the product and meets the demands of high-speed production"" the company said.

Colgate

Colgate advises people not to cut open the toothpaste tube to try and remove excess toothpaste. “During the processing of the tube at the recycling facility the tube is ground up and goes through a ""rinsing"" process where all the residual toothpaste is washed off the plastic. So there's no need for you to do any rinsing at home” the company said in an FAQ.

“Colgate wants to make tubes a part of the circular economy by keeping this plastic productive and eliminating waste” said Noel Wallace Chief Executive Officer and President of Colgate-Palmolive in a release.

“This advancement can make a significant difference in the marketplace today as we test new packaging materials product formats and refillable models to reduce our use of plastic.”

Of course tower cranes have a prominent presence at each high-rise construction site whether freestanding or attached to the skeleton of the building. This collection of photos observes the tower cranes that are currently rising in the Philadelphia skyline in areas ranging from Center City to West Philadelphia and even North Philadelphia.

The first project observed is the CHOP Hub for Clinical Collaboration in West Philadelphia where the steel has risen up to the top of the core with the three tower cranes still attached to the structure. Visible to the left of the CHOP Roberts Center are the two tower cranes for Drexel College of Nursing and Health Professions where the tower is about to top out.

Center City has the most tower cranes popping out of the skyline with the first crane seen in front of Cira Centre for construction on the Schuylkill Expressway which will be complete in 2023. ust to the right in Center City West the Riverwalk south tower eclipses the north tower as the white crane stands high along with the red tower crane for 2222 Market Street in front of Riverwalk. Another red tower crane that is visibly poking out in the skyline is the crane attached to The Laurel Rittenhouse Square. The crane rises around 620 feet tall well above the roughly 500-foot-tall structure of the tower. Visible between the partially completed W/Element Hotel and City Hall is the nearly topped Arthaus condominium with the blue tower crane extending up to around 575 feet high.

In Market East the only tower cranes that stick out in the skyline are the two tower cranes that are currently building the foundation for East Market Phase 3 where the Thomas Jefferson Specialty Care Pavilion will sit on the east side of the site. But when looking to the right at Old City further to the north is the tower cranes for Piazza Terminal surprisingly popping into view. A tower crane that is blocked from view is the red crane for Cathedral Square Phase 1. In total 12 tower cranes are currently visible in the Philadelphia skyline from this vantage point in South Philadelphia.

Casino and Hotel In The Sports Complex District ...,"Today YIMBY looks at the skyline from a brand new viewpoint at the Live! Casino and Hotel which has a fantastic view of the Center City towers. The photographs in this publication are taken from the parking garage located to the south of the hotel portion of the entire project along with being to the south to the skyline. The hotel is located two blocks to the north of Citizens Bank Park in the Sports Complex District in South Philadelphia.

Mostly coming into view is the cluster of the tallest skyscrapers that make up the Philadelphia skyline. The view also stretches all the way from West Philadelphia to Old City including the Camden skyline in the distance. The FMC Tower stands extremely dominant as well. The Comcast Technology Center is the tallest of the bunch at 1121 feet tall. The William Penn statue on top of City Hall pops out above the crown of One South Broad Street near several developments rising around Broad Street.

Observing progress on multiple projects the tallest tower that has made substantial progress is the Arthaus condominium which will stand 542 feet tall. The Laurel Rittenhouse Square will rise taller still to 599 feet visible in front of Two Commerce Center as the tower nears the top of the structure. Smaller projects such as the Riverwalk towers are also making good progress where the south tower is about to top out.

On Thursday Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced all outdoor capacity restrictions within the state will be lifted June 1. Face mask requirements for fully vaccinated people at Comerica Park were dropped May 15 in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Throughout April and May the Tigers have been allowed to host a maximum 8000 fans — just less than 20% capacity. Comerica Park seats 41083 spectators at full capacity. Single-game tickets for games in June are on sale to the general public.

Individual game tickets for July through the end of the regular season are not yet on sale but the Tigers plan to provide further information soon.

On Thursday after Whitmer's announcement the Tigers posted their announcement on Twitter: ""We can't wait to celebrate with 41083 of our closest friends! We're going to show everyone that no one roots like #DetroitRoots. Ticket info coming soon.""

The next day the club made another announcement: ""We can't wait to see you back at the ballpark. A wider selection of seats are now available for all June games.""

The American Lung Association fundraiser typically takes place in the stairwells of Ally Detroit Center and One Woodward but was reimagined for 2021 as an outdoor climb challenge for the safety of participants volunteers and staff in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Participants will participate in one of three distances:

· Stadium Climbers and Elite Stadium Climbers will climb 1076 stairs

· Firefighters and First Responders will climb 2103 stairs; and

· Ultimate Challenge Climbers: 2626 stairs.

· All to raise awareness and money to fight lung disease and end COVID-19.

Money raised at the Fight For Air Climb will fund the Lung Association’s efforts to end lung cancer and lung disease as well as support the Lung Association’s COVID-19 Action Initiative. The COVID-19 Action Initiative is a $25 million investment to address COVID-19 and protect against future respiratory virus pandemics. The initiative works with public and private entities to increase research collaboration and develop new vaccines detection tests and treatment therapies.

Austin who's a physical education teacher at Mackenzie Elementary-Middle School was one of hundreds to participate Sunday in the annual American Lung Association Fight for Air Climb. It's the first time the event has been held at the park and the climb raises awareness and fundraises for lung disease education and clean air advocacy.

That's important to Austin whose brother is battling stage 3 lung cancer.

""It's emotional there's so much uncertainty day to day"" Austin said.

She didn't tell him she was planning to do the stair climb in his honor as he's not the sentimental type or one for big gestures and instead opted to surprise him with a photo of the bib bearing his name afterward.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States despite an increase in survival rate over the last five years to 22.6% according to the American Lung Association. Someone in the nation is diagnosed with lung cancer about every two-and-a-half minutes — four out of five will die from the disease.

Richard Aja 67 of Novi stood with his hands behind his back as he stared out onto the field before ""flight"" time. Both of his parents died of lung cancer 15 years ago and both were smokers. Sunday was Aja's eighth time participating in the stair climb.

""Only you can take care of yourself"" Aja said. He plans to retire this year from his career as a computer scientist and says he's conscious of his health because he wants to enjoy his two grandchildren ages 3 and 3 months.

""I remember when my mom died she said her worst regret was that she wouldn't see her grandson grow up"" he said. Aja was also a smoker until about 2006 when he quit due to social pressure.

Aja is a member of The Blues Climbatize the team that donated the second-highest amount of money for Sunday's campaign with $25218 raised.

The Detroit Climb for Air fundraising campaign surpassed its original goal of $206000 with $350500 raised; $0.88 of every dollar raised by the American Lung Association goes toward research and advocacy.

Due to COVID-19 safety precautions not only was the event outside at Comerica but participants were separated into categories based on stair count and would weave through sections of the stadium at different times. There were 1000 stair climbers — including first responders and firefighters in full gear — who participated in Sunday's event which was sold out at capacity according to the organization.

For Michael Grover 63 of St. Clair training for Sundays stair climb started in February. This year is his sixth stair climb.

""It's personal for me"" Grover said. ""It's really really important for me to find cures.""

Grover's father died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD at the age of 70 and his mother 82 also has COPD. COPD is an inflammatory lung disease that affects airflow from the lungs and it's most often caused from cigarette smoke.

Grover's parents are and were heavy smokers. His sister-in-law was also diagnosed with the disease and his cousin died of lung cancer.

""When it gets really tough I always try to think of my father"" Grover said. ""I like to think he's looking down at me and that I'm making him proud of what I'm doing.""

Born on this day May 23rd in 1934 Robert Arthur Moog would change the landscape of music forever. It is not ridiculous to posit that he affected modern music so significantly his impact is greater than any others. So far-reaching and transformative was his work that music today would literally not exist without him.

Through genius hard work and a sprinkling of goodwill he created the ubiquitous brand of Moog synthesisers. His Moog synthesiser now known as the analogue synthesiser was the first commercial type of the instrument. Before he blessed the world with his products synthesisers such as the RCA Mark II were the size of rooms and were inaccessible to the public.

Robert Moog was a keen physicist and earned a PhD in engineering physics from the Ivy League Cornell University in 1965. He had always had a lifelong passion for science. As a child he preferred to spend time in his father’s workshop rather than practising the harp as his parent’s forced him to. Science and engineering ran in his blood – his father was a Consolidated Edison engineer after all. Due to his early exposure to all sorts of electronics somewhere along the way he became particularly fascinated by the strange science-fiction-esque instrument of the day the theremin.

Even by today’s standards the theremin is a somewhat bizarre and intriguing instrument. Controlled by moving your hands over the antennae creating eerie sounds the theremin has reared its head in some of contemporary music’s most experimental efforts. Have you ever thought about what audio tool marked suspenseful dramas out such as Alfred Hitchcock’s Supernatural the sci-fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still or even the Midsummer Murders theme tune? Well ponder no further.

Showing the extent of Moog’s genius in 1949 aged just 14 he built his own theremin using plans printed in Electronics World. By 18 he had produced his own theremin design and written an editorial on describing it in Radio and Television News. That same year 1953 proved to be a pivotal point for both Moog and music. He founded RA Moog selling theremins and theremin build kits via mail order out of his parents’ house. What’s remarkable about this endeavour is that Moog undertook it whilst completing his education. Furthermore he would have one very illustrious customer; Raymond Scott. Scott whose music was adapted for Looney Tunes and The Ren and Stimpy Show bought one of the kits. From this kit Scott would develop another early synthesiser the Clavivox.

In 1963 Moog would make yet another significant step in his career. He met composer Herb Deutsch at a trade fair for the New York State School Music Association. Deutsch was an adherent of electronic music and at the time was composing his futuristic sound using a theremin tape recorder and a single-pitch oscillator. To say this was a time-consuming process would be an understatement. After recording his electronic sounds on a reel-to-reel Deutsch would splice the tape and rearrange the noises creating something entirely new. Subsequently both Moog and Deutsch were acutely aware of the need for more practical and advanced equipment and so the pair drew up plans for a “portable electronic music studio.”

Before too long and with the wheels already in motion Moog received a grant of $16000 from the New York State Small Business Association. He moved the company upstate to Trumansburg New York. At the time the company resembled a cottage industry. It had a tiny factory and employed around 30 dedicated workers who were continuously “stuffing circuit boards”. At the time of the company’s move to Trumansburg they were building amps and theremins. In conceiving the idea for the new portable synthesiser Moog placed emphasis on affordability and practicality – a direct contrast to his amplifier.

In 1964 Moog began building the first Moog synthesiser. A modular synth it was much smaller than the RCA Mark II. Rather than creating sound from hundreds of vacuum tubes like its complicated and hefty predecessor Moog‘s model featured separate modules that created and shaped the sounds connected by patch leads.

One of Moog’s prototype’s had two voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO) and one voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA). The relationship between both created effects such as modulation vibrato and tremolo. Another critical feature Moog added was the envelope it became a key feature of Moog synthesisers. The envelope controlled the sonic elements of attack decay release and sustain.

According to Moog when Deutsch first laid eyes on the prototype he “went through the roof”. Deutsch was so enthused he immediately commandeered the instrument and started making music. These new mysterious sounds would draw the attention of passerby’s: “They would stand there they’d listen and they’d shake their heads” he said adding: “What is this weird shit coming out of the basement?”

Reflecting the incredible pace that Moog worked at the prototype was complete by the fall of 1964. The pair first demonstrated the synthesiser at the electronic music studio at the University of Toronto. The attendees were so impressed that they subsequently invited Moog to present at the Audio Engineering Society’s annual convention in October.

Moog hadn’t planned to sell his new product at the convention. However by the end of the day customers had placed orders. Contemporary choreographer Alwin Nikolais is credited as being the first person to purchase a commercial Moog synthesiser. Consequently the Moog synthesiser became a made-on-order product. The first person to request a synthesiser with a keyboard and cabinet came from the pioneering composer Eric Siday.

The interesting thing about the first Moog synthesiser was at this point in time they remained a cult item. There were no Moog books or manuals and there was no way to save or share settings. In the early days there were two ways of learning how to use Moog’s modular synth. Either by word of mouth or from seminars and demonstrations held by Moog and Deutsch.

Although it seems rather obtuse today looking like a prop from the TV show The Avengers this first Moog was groundbreaking. It was the smallest synthesiser on the market and cost $10000 compared to the six-figure sums required for other synthesisers. Moreover after Siday’s request Moog’s product came with the keyboard. This was a significant inclusion. Other synthesisers were programmed via punchcards whereas the keyboard made Moog’s model a highly attractive and accessible proposition to musicians.

Consequently Moog refined the synthesiser in response to requests from musicians and composers. Like a musical Hephaestus Moog described himself as a toolmaker who designed things for his customers and always open to suggestions. In this sense he defined the essence of an innovator. The most prominent of these sonic guinea pigs were Deutsch Richard Teitelbaum Vladimir Ussachevsky and Wendy Carlos. The synths were so cutting-edge that even universities established electronic music labs using them.

It would be Wendy Carlos who truly opened the floodgates for the synthesiser. She gave the world the electronic embodiment of “let them eat cake!” Her debut album 1968’s Switched-On Bach went platinum and won three Grammy’s. As the title suggests the album tracks were Bach compositions arranged on the Moog synthesiser by Carlos.

In fact Carlos would have a vital effect on the development of the Moog. She suggested the first touch-sensitive keyboard portamento control and filter bank. These all became standard features again confirming the Moog’s status as the premier synthesiser.

The irony of the instrument is that initially Moog avoided labelling it a “Synthesiser” as this was closely associated with the RCA model. He attempted to run by describing his system as a “system of electronic music modules”. However before too long this revealed as contradictory to his ethos of accessibility. Given the definition of synthesising and after many lengthy debates by 1966 Moog resigned himself to using the word. Moog told friend and composer Reynold Weidenaar: “It’s a synthesiser and that’s what it does and we’re just going to have to go with it.”

Thanks to its genius accessibility and Carlos’ album by the late 1960s many of the biggest musical acts had adopted the instrument. These included the Doors Grateful Dead Rolling Stones and The Beatles.

By 1970 Moog would release his most influential model to date the ‘Minimoog’. This self-contained portable version of its modular predecessor is the one that truly changed the face of music. It picked from where the first iteration left and made the analogue synth truly accessible. Consequently the synthesiser would take off properly in the 1970s. The advent of prog-rock shot Moog and the synthesiser into space. Acts such as Yes Tangerine Dream Rush and Emerson Lake & Palmer popularised the synthesiser.

It wasn’t just prog acts who utilised the synthesiser’s endless possibilities though. Jazz musician Chick Corea was a huge proponent as were Bob Marley and Giorgio Moroder. The most impactful use of the Moog came in 1974 with Kraftwerk‘s game-changing album Autobahn. The German’s album had a transformative effect on music.

Another critical element of the Moog was the pitch wheel giving the instrument a fluidity in performers’ eyes. It has since become a fundamental synthesiser concept. However Moog would make a decision that brought the synthesiser to global dominance. Harking back to his comments about his being a designer creating tools for use he refused to patent any of his ideas apart from the filter design. In tune with his organic essence his concepts were the intellectual property of everybody. This availability in the public domain helped the synthesiser and electronic instrument industry flourish. In retrospect commentators have noted how wealthy Moog would have become had he patented his ideas. However this was not what Robert Moog was about.

In 1971 Moog sold RA Moog to Norlin Musical Instruments where he stayed on as a designer until 1977 showing that he was a committed innovator at heart. In 1978 he founded Big Briar and renamed it Moog music after buying back the rights to his name. Following his extended stay in the world of business in his later years he taught at the University of North Carolina Asheville where he worked on more futuristic instrument designs.

Another interesting point about the Moog synthesiser was that it came at precisely the right time. It came in the midst of the ’60s when the old order was being destroyed and new ideas and the counterculture were shifting the tectonic plates of society creating a new world full of possibility.

In total hilarity at one point the Moog was banned from use in commercial work. Thanks to its ability to imitate orchestral instruments such as strings and horns the Moog and other synthesisers were deemed to be an existential threat to session musicians. The ban stemmed from the uproar caused by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM).

Showing the extent of his foresight Moog felt that the AFM saw the synthesiser in the wrong light. He knew that his product was an instrument to be honed and used like any other. He thought that “all the sounds that musicians could make somehow existed in the Moog — all you had to do was push a button that said ‘Jascha Heifetz’ and out would come the most fantastic violin player.”

Unfortunately Robert Moog passed away in 2005. However his impact on music cannot be understated. Through his intellect innovation and goodwill he changed the face of music forever. Since its release the synthesiser has become a ubiquitous instrument and Moog’s sounds are plastered everywhere stretching from Daft Punk and Flying Lotus to Deftones and J Dilla.

The thing about the Moog is your favourite artist has almost certainly used one at some point. Without Moog’s work music would not have opened up into the fluid format we have today. Most significantly DAW’s such as Logic and Ableton which allow anyone to create music from home would not exist without his work. Moog embodied the essence of music as an accessible craft and for that we thank him.

La Fête du Rosé launched in 2019 to debunk tired tropes about rosé wine and who drinks it said its founder and CEO Donae Burston.

“We wanted to create a rosé wine that would be taken seriously” he said. “A luxury brand marketed toward everyone.”

Throughout a 15-year career in the wine and spirits industry working with brands such as Hennessy Dom Pérignon and Moet he’d noticed rosé marketed as a feminine beverage that was little more than alcohol-flavored pink water.

But Burston knew better. He had had ample opportunity to visit the south of France where rosé is a popular summer drink among men and women alike. At a cocktail party during the Cannes Film Festival in 2017 he made contacts at Domaine Bertaud Belieu in Saint-Tropez. Soon afterward he launched the first Black-owned rosé label produced in the region.

His rosé leans toward dry with notes of fresh strawberries and hazelnut. The magazine Wine Enthusiast bestowed 90 points on La Fête praising it for a ripeness that is “spicy and fresh at the same time.”

It pairs with anything Burston said. On the brand’s Instagram page visitors will see photos of it alongside caviar French fries or grilled branzino. They will also notice the label’s target audience: everyone. And yes people of color especially.

“For so long minority wine drinkers were overlooked” Burston said. “We weren’t seen as serious consumers in this space.”

Rising interest in Black-owned brands has widened the industry’s lens he said. Quarantine and the booming popularity of rosé — with sales growing by more than 40% per year in the U.S. according to the site Wine Economist — have also created a snowball effect that’s quickly raised the label’s profile.

La Fête du Rosé is the first company to receive investment dollars as part of Constellation’s Focus on Minority Founders initiative launched last summer. Constellation Brands committed to investing $100 million in minority-owned businesses in the beverage alcohol industry by 2030 according to a company spokesperson.

“Donae has created a truly unique and distinctive lifestyle brand and we believe the rosé category continues to have a lot of growth potential” Jennifer Evans Constellation’s vice president of ventures wrote via email.

Evans said Constellation is looking for brands that set themselves apart in the market and that are looking to grow. She credited La Fête du Rosé’s consumer-first approach to building a brand that reflects today’s multicultural consumer values.

Constellation’s faith in the product will inject further energy into the brand Burston said.

“For so many minority-owned businesses the hardest part is access to capital and infrastructure” he added. “We want to continue to grow and grow the right way while maintaining our brand’s story.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

SAN FRANCISCO – Late Friday night Gabe Kapler called old teammate Scott Kazmir with wonderful news: The veteran left-hander was needed in San Francisco to start the next day.

The Giants called up the 37-year-old Kazmir from Triple-A Sacramento to make his first big league appearance since 2016 when he went 10-6 with a 4.56 ERA over 26 starts for the Los Angeles Dodgers who just so happened to be his opponent Saturday at Oracle Park.

“It was actually pretty gratifying to be able to deliver that to him and actually through the phone I could tell that he was smiling” said Kapler who played with Kazmir for Tampa Bay in 2009.

Kazmir quickly surrendered a two-out splash homer to Max Muncy in the first inning — the ball into McCovey Cove beyond right field traveled an estimated 423 feet with an exit velocity of 108.2 mph.

Kazmir pitched four innings allowing only one run and two hits. He walked none struck out two and exited after 55 pitches against the World Series champions.

“It’s been a long journey for him and really kind of proud"" Kapler said before the game. “He and I were teammates a long time ago and I know that the journey hasn’t been the easiest one for him. It’s a pretty cool story.""

Highly touted when he was drafted in the first round by the New York Mets in 2002 out of high school in Houston Kazmir is now with his seventh major league club in 13 years.

A three-time All-Star Kazmir pitched in independent ball last year determined to make a comeback.

Plagued by elbow injuries that derailed him in 2011 and had him pitching in independent ball in 2012 Kazmir made 32 starts in 2014 for Oakland and 31 between the Athletics and Houston the next year.

He pitched last year for the Eastern Reyes del Tigre of the Constellation Energy League in Sugar Land Texas. Kazmir went 2-1 with a 4.20 ERA over four appearances and three starts.

Kapler wasn't sure how deep into the game Kazmir might work in his return though he had been built up to about three innings and somewhere in the range of 55-60 pitches.

Kazmir was 1-0 with a 2.84 ERA in two outings with one start covering 6 1/3 innings for Sacramento.

The reports Kapler received are that Kazmir has reached 91-93 mph on his fastball which Kapler notes is “not Scott Kazmir circa 2005 but also not far off where he was toward the end of his last major league stint. His changeup and delivery have been solid and he's “strong and healthy” Kapler said.

Kazmir led the American League in strikeouts with 239 for the Rays in 2007.

At 37 years 118 days Kazmir became the oldest Giants pitcher to start a game since Tim Hudson on Oct. 1 2015 at 40 years 79 days.

“It’s going to be a bit of a whirlwind for him” Kapler said.

The Giants admire how Kazmir stuck with it over years to give himself another shot — and Kapler certainly appreciated the pitcher's work ethic during spring training. In fact Kapler recalled Saturday the first bullpen Kazmir threw in Scottsdale Arizona three months ago resembling Kazmir at his top 2016 form.

“It’s a fantastic story it’s a story of perseverance and one of resilience” Kapler said. “It’s a testament to his drive and his determination and his willingness to kind of go through some difficult stretches. It’s not easy to be an established major league pitcher with a long career a lot of service time made a ton of money and then go back to independent ball to try to get another shot.”

He threw 55 pitches 38 for strikes settling in with a 2.25 ERA. On the other side Walker Buehler pitched seven innings for Los Angeles improving to 3-0.

The Irvine-area hub used to make a variety of implantables consumables and other eycare-related equipment is one of its three largest locations in the U.S. along with spots in Fort Worth Texas which is home to its domestic operations and Georgia. It employs 1100 locally according to Business Journal research.

Irvine Co. Building



The Spectrum-area facility near the San Diego (405) and Laguna (133) freeways was built in 1990 and is owned by Newport Beach-based Irvine Co.



Alcon’s Irvine operations are used to manufacture eye-related surgical equipment and the company’s current Alton Parkway facilities contain “some of the most sophisticated ophthalmic research and manufacturing activities in the world” the company has previously stated.

Last year Darigold the product brand for a dairy cooperative headquartered in Seattle canceled its 30-year contract with the prison forcing the state’s prison work program Montana Correctional Enterprises to scale down its dairy operation from 350 head to about 70 enough to produce milk to self-sustain the Department of Correction’s facilities around the state.

Darigold ended its contract after one of its major customers said last year it would begin to phase out all products made with legal prison labor according to the corrections department.

In an email with the Montana State News Bureau Darigold did not identify the customer and spokesperson Erin Byrne said the company would not identify a customer by name. However corrections’ officials named Costco as the customer during legislative hearings.

Costco’s shifts in labor policies last year touched producers around the world leading the company to even part ways with a Thai coconut milk producer accused of “forced monkey labor.”

The end of the prison program’s contract translates to a $1.5 million loss to the work program and a reduced work program for adult male inmates housed at the facility outside of Deer Lodge. A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said the entire effect of the loss of revenue won’t be fully known for about a year as MCE adjusts to the lower capacity.

“At this point we do not know the entire effect of the loss of revenue as we are still adjusting our inventory levels for feed and supplement for the animals” DOC spokesperson Carolynn Bright told the Montana State News Bureau. “MCE Agriculture is 100% self-supporting and does not receive a general fund appropriation. Instead the loss is to MCE proprietary funds.”

Lawmakers in April approved a $1 million for a new venture to fill the gap. House Bill 637 sponsored by Joliet Republican Seth Berglee did many things among them establish a new program to raise pheasants at the prison. The allocation was a source of contention among lawmakers during the legislative process: some lawmakers would have rather seen that million spent on wildlife habitat while Berglee and others argue the money is well spent on bolstering the state pheasant population on public lands drawing more young hunters into bird hunting.

Montana Correctional Enterprises a division of the state corrections department is headquartered outside of Deer Lodge near the Montana State Prison. The work program including dog trainings products manufacturing and other services provides training for approximately 700 inmates according to MCE’s website.

The agriculture operations raise beef cattle and crops all utilized in-house MCE Director Gayle Butler told a legislative committee in January. The dairy operation includes a processing plant that churns out non-fat milk cottage cheese and yogurt. The majority of MCE’s raw milk was sold to Darigold.

“We would pick up milk every other day and deliver it to one of their bottle plants across Montana or Idaho” Butler told the legislative budget subcommittee on Jan. 21.

Inmates working the agriculture jobs stay in dorms outside the prison walls. Ross Wagner agriculture director at MCE likened the quarters to a pre-release center. Inmates apply for the open MCE jobs and have to be designated as minimum custody clear disciplinary records and a high school diploma or have completed their GED. If inmates are selected for the job they sign a four-month commitment to the work and stay in the dorms. Thirty-three inmates and five staff run the dairy operation Wagner said.

“The guys that come out there most of them would rather be working as much as possible instead of sitting in their (cell)” Wagner said.

The majority of the prison program’s milk production went to Darigold and in turn much of it ended up in Costco coolers. In 2018 Costco enacted a global policy on prison labor that allowed prison-made products so long as the inmates were paid a prevailing wage with its first report in 2019. The next year Darigold notified the prison it would not be able to meet the policy.

“There was no way DOC could accomplish this and remain economically viable as we are a training program” Butler told the committee. “We could operate our dairy with only staff but that does not provide the training and work programs needed for our offenders.”

The Department of Corrections tried to appeal to Costco. In a letter to the company the department tallied up the inmates’ wages cost of room and board and health coverage which included dental and vision mental health services and savings for the inmates’ re-entry after their sentence.

“All came to $22.16 per hour given all these factors” Butler said. “Unfortunately that was not adequate.”

Butler said state officials too contacted Costco in hopes they could sway the company but the effort failed. The Department of Corrections also set out in search of a new partner to purchase the milk.

“After an exhaustive search we were unable to find an alternate buyer and the dairy needed to reduce its milk production” Department of Corrections Director Brian Gootkin said in an email in March. The work program sold off the cows and began exploring new products that could be made at its processing plant. The dairy still produces other dairy products like yogurt and ice cream for the inmates.

Darigold is a marketing and processing subsidiary of the Northwest Dairy Association a cooperative of 350 dairy producers in Washington Oregon Idaho and Montana.

We went above and beyond contract requirements and explored ways to continue as well as gave MCE ample notice of this decision” Darigold spokesperson Byrne told the Montana State News Bureau in an email. “Unfortunately the primary reason for this decision was due (to) the fact that MCE could not meet the official policy requirements of a major Darigold customer recipient of their milk.

“Our purpose is to create value for our customers and our Northwest Dairy Association farmer member-owners including existing member-owners in Montana” Byrne continued. “In this case certain business conditions existed that made the contract with MCE no longer viable.”

The Montana corrections department and Darigold both referenced declining market conditions when asked to comment for this story. In 2020 the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the number of dairy herds fell by more than half between 2002 and 2019 with an accelerating rate of decline in 2018 and 2019. COVID-19 also caused great uncertainty in the industry.

“Milk prices fluctuate it’s an ag commodity” Wagner said. “When the price of milk drops we feel it just like anyone else does.”

Ultimately however the department’s bid to Costco to reverse its policies may have been too late. In a 2020 statement to investors Costco said it was going to phase away from prison labor altogether due to “the reduced transparency of prison systems in general” which made it hard to reliably monitor the wages paid out to inmates. In its entire supply chain Costco had identified 11 facilities that used prison work programs to make products sold on Costco’s shelves.

A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections declined to comment when asked if reduced transparency was part of the discussion when Darigold notified the prison it would end its contract with MCE. Darigold likewise declined to comment on Costco’s specific policy requirements MCE’s dairy program failed to meet. A spokesperson for Costco also declined to comment when asked if any transparency issues with the Montana State Prison prompted the company’s decision.

To backfill the reduced dairy operation MCE will now develop the blueprints for raising pheasants as a new training opportunity for inmates. Just like the inmates Wagner will be learning a new trade.

Costco shoppers are raving on Reddit over a brand of whole coffee beans you may not have heard of before. A Redditor started the conversation by posting ""Ruta Maya coffee beans does anyone else love this stuff or am I crazy?"" Costco sells Ruta Maya organic coffees in 5-lb. bags for the reasonable price of $41.99 to $47.99 according to the Costco website.

The Reddit thread included a friendly debate about whether medium or dark roast was better with medium gaining the edge. Few argued about whether Ruta Maya coffee was good however. (Although there are always a few naysayers in every bunch.) ""This is hands down the BEST coffee ever!"" Redditor BirthdayGuest commented. ""It always throws me for a loop when I need coffee and Costco is out. Nothing compares!"" Reddit user ihave80D expressed a similar sentiment. ""One of the best coffees I've ever tasted"" they said. ""Was really not happy when I had to wait 2 weeks after they ran out one time.""

Participants in the Reddit conversation also liked Ruta Maya coffee for making cold brew. ""I use the medium roast and have been drinking it exclusively as cold brew for a couple of years now. It's fantastic!"" thattrippingsound commented. But there's another reason to sing the brand's praises too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8va3JvY25ld3MuY29tL21pZHdlc3RzLWxhcmdlc3Qtd2VhdGhlci12YW5lLWlzLTItaG91cnMtZnJvbS1yb2NoZXN0ZXItdmlkZW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Midwest's Largest Weather Vane Is 2 Hours from Rochester (VIDEO),"Get our free mobile app

My adventures in Martin County Minnesota continue to deliver fun landmarks that remind us of our farming past and present. The power of the land here in Minnesota and those who work it wasn't just about hard work and crops.

It was about fun and creativity. About laughter and family. And finding something to do with that old tractor.

About two hours West of Rochester outside Fairmont Minnesota is a crossroads. On the way to Church my girlfriend Diana said ""That's a real tractor up there on the weather vane.""

Me: A what on the...ohhhh holy moly!

Her: Yeah he made that himself and put it up himself.

Me: We HAVE to drive back this way after lunch.

Her: Pictures?

Me: Obvi.

If you're trying to see what the words are on the weather vane it says ""Bulfer Century Farms - 1912"".

This Means More To You Than Just A Cool Landmark Doesn't It?

It does! Farmers have always had to be many things in addition to being a farmer. You'd be hard pressed to find one that doesn't also know welding construction engineering mad amounts of math meteorology engine and machinery repair business management and comedy. Oh and maybe most of all creativity.

You have to be creative to make the whole thing work. But it's not just creativity you see in the farming operation you also see it in their daily lives. Little hacks they work out to make everyday life easier better and more fun.

To me this giant weather vane is a symbol of all that.

Are There Other Tractor Wind Vanes?

I didn't think there would be but it turns out yes. Up in Canada there's a tractor museum with what they claim is the World's Largest Tractor Weather Vane. Sorry it's such low light video not a lot of videos of it.

If you like old tractor here's the tractor museum where the video above was taken.

This may actually the be largest non-tractor weather vane...a DC-3!

His legacy lives on in her own shop,"New York CNN Business —

Chicago entrepreneur Keewa Nurullah learned one of her most valued business lessons from her great-grandfather Simeon Neal Sr. a survivor of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre.

Nurullah’s great-grandfather ran a tailor shop in the Greenwood district of Tulsa — a prosperous African American community that became known as Black Wall Street. But he was forced to abandon his business when an angry mob of White vigilantes burned most of the 35-block neighborhood to the ground on May 31 1921. An estimated 70 to 300 people died in the attack and hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed.

According to accounts from his descendants one of Neal’s customers snuck Neal his wife Susan and their two small children Marjorie and Simeon Neal Jr. out of town by hiding them under bales of hay in the back of a wagon. The family managed to escape the carnage.

“If one thing had changed if he hadn’t connected with that customer or that customer had gone somewhere else I wouldn’t be here” Nurullah told CNN Business.

Nearly a century after the massacre Nurullah is honoring her great-grandfather’s entrepreneurial legacy by running her own business Kido a multicultural children’s apparel book and toy store on the South Side of Chicago.

She sometimes reflects on how her great-grandfather’s relationship with a customer saved the lives of her family members.

“When people come in the shop and I stir up those conversations it’s not just purely transactional for me” Nurullah said. “You never know how people will end up being instrumental in your life.”

A legacy is born

After fleeing Tulsa in 1921 the Neal family eventually settled in Chicago. That’s where Neal reopened his tailor shop and his wife would give birth to four more children: Harold Juanita James and Susan.

Simeon Neal Jr. spent his childhood learning his father’s trade before serving as a tailor in the US Army during World War II. He later opened his own shop in Chicago where he would design and make men’s suits just like his father.

He married Rosa Lee Campbell in 1948 after returning from the war. The couple later had two children Wallace and Nurullah’s mother Velma who eventually changed her name to Shanta Nurullah.

Keewa Nurullah and her mother say most of what they know about the Tulsa riots came from the stories Neal Jr. and his siblings would share on rare occasions.

“Everybody in the family has a slightly different version based on who they heard it from” Shanta Nurullah recalled. “Every time the story is told it’s told a little differently and they remember different parts of it.”

Tulsa historian Scott Ellsworth author of “The Ground Breaking: An American City and Its Search for Justice” said somewhere between 100 and 200 businesses were operating in the Greenwood district prior to the massacre but photos and written records of the event are hard to come by today.

“How many old letters do you have from your great-grandmother in your family?” asked Ellsworth who is helping lead an effort to uncover the unmarked graves of massacre victims. “There’s obviously newspaper accounts. They’re all available. A lot of the records were all destroyed.”

CNN found Neal Sr.’s tailoring business listed on the Greenwood Cultural Center’s Black Wall Street Memorial which was built in 1996. The late author Mary E. Jones Parrish also lists his business in “Events of the Tulsa Disaster” her 1923 eyewitness account of the massacre.

In the early 2000s Neal Jr. who was an infant at the time of the massacre began receiving recognition as a survivor of the Tulsa riots according to his family. He died in 2002.

“Every year he would get this flimsy little certificate in the mail for being one of the last Tulsa survivors” Nurullah recalled. “Before he passed he was living history. He just would get this flimsy little paper certificate in the mail saying ‘Yay you’re still here.’”

The lack of widespread acknowledgment of the Tulsa race massacre has been a frustrating reality for the Nurullah family up until recently. In 2019 the fictional HBO series “The Watchmen” opened with a dramatic depiction of the Tulsa massacre. In a pivotal early scene a Black family is shown being smuggled out of the city while hiding in the back of a wagon.

It hit close to home. Nurullah said she wept as she watched the scene for the first time and had the same reaction when the massacre was depicted again in “Lovecraft Country” a year later.

“I couldn’t finish it” she recalled. “I felt kind of a visceral personal reaction to seeing that on the screen. … I don’t think I have ever felt so connected to or affected by any piece of art like that before.”

Nurullah embarked on her own entrepreneurial mission in 2016 when she started selling customized multicultural kids clothing online. It was not long after the birth of her eldest child Feraz Freitag.

It’s kind of like destiny. I was meant to do this. It’s literally in my blood.” Keewa Nurullah

“I was kind of shopping for [Feraz] and just kept seeing the gaps in representation for kids and babies especially little Black boys” she said. “I had a couple ideas for some onesies. I got them printed out and went to see if anyone on my network liked what I was doing and went from there.”

After a couple years Nurullah’s business had grown and she was able to save and borrow enough money from family to open her own shop.

Despite having to close her shop for several months due to government restrictions Nurullah’s business flourished during the pandemic. Parents were purchasing games puzzles and dolls to keep their children entertained while they were forced to stay home.

Nurullah took out a Paycheck Protection Program loan to help cover the business’ losses during the early months of the shutdown. But she said online sales of her multicultural books and toys were booming most of the year especially amid the cultural push to support Black businesses that erupted after the police murder of George Floyd.

“We weren’t honestly selling as many before the pandemic and then once I saw that pattern of what people were looking for I started ordering more toys and puzzles and that sort of thing” she said. “Even though we were closed to foot traffic we were kind of like a little fulfillment center.”

Nurullah said knowing her ancestors have survived worse has given her added confidence and strength to persevere as an entrepreneur especially during the pandemic.

“I think it definitely pushes me forward and gives me an edge” she said. “It’s kind of like destiny. I was meant to do this. It’s literally in my blood.”"

In the mid-1980s the Microsoft co-founder entrusted management of his growing fortune to Andrew Evans a close friend who ran a brokerage firm.

The pair had known each other since Microsoft’s early days bonding over their love of sports cars and hot technology stocks. Evans described the relationship as “one of the most important friendships” in his life.

Despite this their professional ties came crashing down after a newspaper exposé in 1993 revealed Evans had spent time in prison for bank fraud years earlier. Gates who had visited his friend when he was behind bars did not need the attention.

The US government had started to sniff around allegations of anti-competitive behaviour from Microsoft and Gates was months away from getting married. He parted ways with Evans shortly after.

Given the history it is hardly surprising that the management of Gates’ immense fortune since then has been designed to attract as little attention as possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbWVzYW5kZ2FyZGVucy5jb20vbmV3cy9icml0aXNoLXBlcmlvZC1kcmFtYXMtZmlsbS1sb2NhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 British period drama locations every TV and movie fan should visit,"If you've ever wondered if you can visit the famous film locations of British period dramas the answer is 'yes'!

When the temperature threatens to inch into the triple digits and humidity smothers the air not even the stale breeze choking from dying A/C units can provide relief.

Not like Chattanooga's swimming holes can.

Luring locals in with cool waters and stunning scenery for decades the area's natural swimming spots have always offered refuge from the summer sun but that isn't the extent of their appeal.

The biggest selling point of this creek's deep swimming holes is accessibility.

3. Rainbow Lake

Pooling beneath the waterfall-like dam that created it Rainbow Lake is another Chattanooga favorite. The water cascading over the structure provides a beautiful view to soak in before getting your feet wet while a nearby rope swing and the dam itself offer plenty of ways to salvage a bit of summer fun before it's time to dry off. Not to mention that a visit to this Signal Mountain spot is noticeably cool - as in typically 10 degrees cooler than the Scenic City below.

Drive Time: 20 minutes from downtown Chattanooga

Hike Distance: 1 mile

Check the depth before attempting any daredevil-like stunts as the water level fluctuates greatly.

4. Ozone Falls

Ozone Falls / Creative Commons photo



The aqua blue pool under this 110-foot waterfall may be quite the drive from Chattanooga but the mystical quality and ease of access make it the perfect destination for a memorable weekend escape. The dome shape of the rock towering over this hidden swimming spot creates a natural amphitheater that keeps the air swirling with mist from the waterfall. With the falls located only 15 minutes from the parking lot the hardest part of your trip to Ozone Falls will be leaving.

Drive Time: 1.5 hours from downtown Chattanooga

Hike Distance: Less than 1 mile

Hike Difficulty: Easy

Area Amenities: None

Fast Facts: We weren't the only ones who noticed Ozone Falls' natural beauty. Disney chose the location to shoot scenes from the recent Jungle Book film.

5. Blue Hole Ocoee

Blue Hole Ocoee



Most swimming holes boast exotic locales with beautiful landscapes but at the Ocoee the best views are found underwater. Along with a few traditional blue holes the Upper Ocoee River is home to a series of underwater tunnels that make for an unforgettable snorkeling experience.

6. Foster Falls

Foster Falls / Creative Commons photo



Outdoorsmen may hail the Foster Falls State Park as one of the South's premiere rock climbing destinations but hidden at the base of the hallmark 60-foot waterfall is a pool whose reputation rivals the area's stone. A playground for adrenaline junkies the hike down is steep rocky and a little uneven in some places but the cavernous promised land at the bottom welcomes wanderers with 10 feet of refreshingly cold water and a jaw-dropping view of the canyon-like cliffs from below.

Drive Time: 45 minutes from downtown Chattanooga

Hike Distance: Less than 2 miles

Hike Difficulty: Moderate

Parking: Paved parking lot

Area Amenities: Restrooms campsites picnic area grills

Fast Facts: Foster Falls' swimming hole has a bit of competition. While it's the largest pool in the area there are other swimming spots along Fiery Gizzard Trail including the one under Sycamore Falls which some say is the best in the area. If you've got time for an additional two-hour hike and a second test swim you can find out for sure.

7. Greeter Falls

The blue hole resting under this 50-foot waterfall may sound too good to be true. Not only are its crystal waters seemingly bottomless and postcard-ready year-round the large pool is also fairly easy to hike to. The quickest route takes you half a mile from the trailhead and down a memorable spiral staircase but there are also several other marked trails for those hoping to work for their reward.

Drive Time: 1.25 hours from downtown Chattanooga

Hike Distance: Less than 1 mile

Hike Difficulty: Easy

Parking: Lot at trailhead

Area Amenities: Picnic area and trash cans

Middle Creek is home to an elusive natural water slide whose admission is paid in sweat. To reach this Holy Grail of swimming holes explorers must trek roughly three miles up the creek bed through untamed land with no definitive trail. The few who successfully traverse the giant boulders and fallen trees are rewarded not only with a unique sliding experience but also with decent ledges for jumping and sweet sweet seclusion.

Drive Time: 15 minutes from downtown Chattanooga

Hike Distance: 3 miles

Hike Difficulty: Hard

Parking: Unmarked pulloffs along the roadway

Area Amenities: None

Fast Facts: Middle Creek is home to several swimming holes. If you don't make it to the pool with the water slide chances are you'll find one of the other swimming spots along the way. Don't be afraid to stop and enjoy!

Watch Out: Middle Creek is notorious for car break-ins. Since a smashed window will probably ruin your day it might be best to clean everything out of your car and leave the windows rolled down to prevent unwanted damages.

Dr Louise Madden

What is the focus of the course and what do you aim to achieve?

How would you see this qualification and increasing glaucoma care in the community in Scotland benefiting both patients and secondary care?

NESGAT provides an opportunity to build and strengthen links between primary and secondary care Dr Louise Madden NESGAT Lead

How do you think this approach fits into the future of community eye care?

Mrs Lisa Cowan NESGAT Lead

Could you tell us what impact COVID-19 had on the course in terms of the education delivery and clinical placements?

Why might optometrists want to consider further qualifications particularly in areas such as glaucoma care?

What have you taken away from the first year of delivering the course?

In 2017 NHS Education for Scotland (NES) optometry programme directors Lesley Rousselet and Kathy Morrison reviewed postgraduate optometry courses for glaucoma care. At that point the profession in Scotland had been developing their confidence working under the 2015 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline 144 on glaucoma referral and safe discharge and we had a rapidly growing number of independent prescribers (IP) keen to take on new challenges. Even then we knew of the capacity challenges building in secondary care and recognised the potential for patients to receive safe effective and patient-centred care for their glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT) in the community.Our review highlighted a gap for a qualification that extended the remit to autonomous management that had IP as a starting point and that recognised the profession’s strong performance in the area. The Scottish Government showed their support for our proposals in 2018 by funding the design and delivery of the NES Glaucoma Award Training (NESGAT).Ultimately NESGAT supports the shift of appropriate eye care out of hospitals and into the community by preparing optometrists to extend their remit. It is a valuable opportunity for role development; although we imagine for some taking on NESGAT it may be used to validate current delivery such as our secondary care colleagues.It was a great benefit to have the Royal College of Ophthalmologists Common Clinical Competency Framework for glaucoma to align to and also a great opportunity to rethink how we deliver placements for postgraduate qualifications with the move to an outcomes-based focus.NESGAT provides an opportunity to build and strengthen links between primary and secondary care supporting understanding and trust. It also quality assures the care patients will receive in the community supporting service redesign. We hope it will support freeing up capacity in secondary care to see those with more complex glaucoma. Reducing waiting times for glaucoma appointments by increasing capacity is a big win right now and for many cases care will be provided closer to home than a standard hospital review appointment.Scotland already makes very good use of community eye care teams who provide the first port of call for all eye-related health issues. Qualifications such as NESGAT support role development and new models of care that enhance community eye care whilst supporting secondary care. By targeted training and support NES hope to facilitate further enhanced eye care delivery in Scotland in areas such as low vision and medical retina.The pilot year of the NESGAT programme began in February 2020 and as such has been largely overshadowed by COVID-19. The online learning content and discussions were relatively unaffected but the NESGAT outcomes-based placements due to begin in hospital glaucoma clinics in April 2020 were affected. We quickly worked to support outcomes being signed off via a mix of remote simulation-based scenarios some community shared care work and come August face-to-face clinics. These changes worked very well so we have revised our online logbook to better support our 2021 cohort.One of the unexpected benefits of COVID-19 was that we introduced fortnightly online meetings to provide interaction and try to keep everyone motivated with studying over the summer and this proved so successful that we are also planning to continue these in 2021.There are many reasons for this and the answers are probably different for each individual. This year’s cohort have enjoyed the challenge of learning more about glaucoma – it’s such a vast and complex topic and one of the things that’s come up time and time again is that there’s always more to learn and that the learning will continue even after the course has been completed. In fact NES have secured additional funding from the Scottish Government to develop a mentorship programme to support our NESGAT optometrists – a very exciting opportunity to ensure continued growth in confidence and competence.The ability to provide an enhanced service to patients is a real motivation particularly as all the NESGAT optometrists are IP-qualified and so have already been able to see the difference that having a prescribing qualification can make on their ability to care for their patients in the community.

LC: Flexibility has been hugely important – if we hadn’t been able to do this it would have been impossible to deliver the programme successfully. We will continue to make changes and to improve the programme in response to feedback from learners whose enthusiasm and commitment has really been key to the success of the pilot year.

With the impact of COVID-19 on eye care services we feel very proud to be supporting such significant redesign of how glaucoma care is delivered in Scotland and of the practitioners taking on the challenge.

What made you apply for the qualification?

David Cummins

Have you completed any clinical placements as part of this and if so what has this experience been like?

David Cummins student on the NESGAT course and independent prescribing optometrist (DC): I have always been interested in glaucoma and I am addicted to professional advancement so NESGAT was a no-brainer. I have always found that seeking new areas of practice keeps me from getting bored in my job.

DC: Yes clinical placement was a mix of hospital and community-based glaucoma work. As a response to COVID-19-related capacity challenges we have set up four community glaucoma clinics in Fife. In my main practice in Leven I have seen six glaucoma patients every Friday afternoon for the last six months. Once I have completed a full examination on a dozen patients I have an online meeting with the glaucoma consultant to confirm the management plan for each. This ‘decision support meeting’ is held over a shared desktop and provides a very powerful learning tool for a newbie glaucomatologist.

Specialist community glaucoma optometrists are a huge benefit to glaucoma patients by providing timely high quality and accessible care David Cummins independent prescribing optometrist and NESGAT student

What have been the key takeaways you have gained from completing the course?

DC: The more you learn about glaucoma the less you seem to actually know for sure. Glaucoma is complex and time-consuming however the satisfaction from working with these patients is immense. Glaucoma care requires both attention to detail and the ability to step back and make a global judgement considering all the evidence - a very cerebral activity.

Could you tell us what you plan to do next?

DC: Continue the learning journey. I feel that I have only just started to learn about glaucoma and I intend (funding permitting) to continue to host NHS glaucoma clinics in my practice and work towards a level of autonomy and expertise as I gain more experience.

What impact do you feel this qualification could have for enhancing and supporting services in the community?

DC: Specialist community glaucoma optometrists are a huge benefit to glaucoma patients by providing timely high quality and accessible care. Most glaucoma patients we see in our glaucoma clinic are delighted to be seen locally. Community glaucoma clinics will also assist hospital glaucoma services prioritise those patients with the greatest risk of sight loss.

What would you say to an optometrist who might be considering further qualifications in glaucoma?

DC: Glaucoma is not a finite subject but if you want a challenge that just keeps on giving then glaucoma is for you. From a financial perspective glaucoma care is never going to be a money-spinner but will certainly keep the grey cells ticking over and help the reputation of your practice."

Along the way the pandemic presented the pharmacy chain with an opportunity: helping the pharmaceutical industry find volunteers for clinical trials evaluating experimental Covid vaccines and medications. CVS is now building on that experience with the formation of a new clinical trial services business.

During the pandemic CVS used digital models and screening techniques to engage with more than 300000 people who met criteria for clinical trials. It employed these technologies to connect volunteers to studies close to where they live. Woonsocket Rhode Island-based CVS said its new clinical trial services business will work in a similar way helping life science companies and contract research organizations (CROs) recruit patients for studies.

Patient recruitment for clinical trials is a longstanding challenge for the pharmaceutical and CRO industries. Companies have had a particularly difficult time recruiting study participants who reflect the diversity of the intended patient population for an experimental drug or medical device. CVS’s push into clinical trial recruitment comes as pharmaceutical companies and CROs accelerate their adoption of decentralized clinical trials studies that don’t revolve around academic medical centers as clinical trial sites and instead reach study participants in their communities even their homes.

Extending a clinical trial beyond the usual clinical trial site requires technological capabilities some of which CVS brings to the table. The company said it will use analytics along with its national and local reach to engage with people and help them learn about the clinical trial opportunities that may be right for them. The company will also offer decentralized options that deliver late-stage clinical testing and real-world evaluation of products at its more than 8100 retail stores in people’s homes or virtually. CVS added that the evidence it gains will support retrospective and prospective studies assessing the impact of new drugs and devices in real-world settings.

CVS is familiar to most people as a pharmacy and its pharmacy services business is the company’s biggest segment generating nearly $142 billion of the company’s $268 billion in 2020 revenue according to its annual report. In the $91 billion retail and long term care business segment sales at the front of the store (over the counter products medicines health and beauty products and personal care items) showed a marginal increase over 2019 figures. But other revenue in that segment rose 83.7% a change the company attributed to an increase in Covid-19 diagnostic testing.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Though the clinical trial services business is new to CVS it’s not the company’s first foray into clinical trials. Two years ago the company began a clinical trial testing a hemodialysis device designed to enable patients to conduct the procedure in their homes rather than going to a dialysis center. In addition to safety features the device was designed to be simple enough for patients to use at home. The study which will test up to 70 participants is still recruiting patients according to clinical trial records.

CVS executives said that the company hopes its new business helps overcome the challenges of clinical trial participation including low patient enrollment and the lack of diversity.

“Combining clinical trial expertise from across the CVS Health enterprise with our growing connection to the communities we serve will help create a new clinical trial experience that works better for participants health care providers clinical research organizations and study sponsors” Troyen Brennan executive vice president and chief medical officer of CVS Health said in a prepared statement.

In his new Apple TV+ docuseries The Me You Can’t See Prince Harry revealed sweet new details about Archie Harrison his 2-year-old son with Meghan Markle. Among them: Some of Archie’s first words were “Grandma Diana.” Harry said “I’ve got a photo up in his nursery…and it was one of the first words that he said. Apart from ‘mama’ ‘papa’ it was then ‘grandma’ ‘grandma Diana.’ It’s the sweetest thing but at the same time makes me really sad.”

Harry also shared short clips of his son for the docuseries marking the first time that he and Meghan have shared photos of Archie’s face. The new clips show Archie playing on a swing and frolicking with his mom on the beach. Previously Harry had shared another of Archie’s first words with James Corden: “crocodile.” “Crocodile three syllables” he told James. “He is hysterical he’s got the most amazing personality. He’s already putting three four words together; he’s already singing songs.”

Of Diana Harry said “I wish she could have met Meghan. I wish she was around for Archie.” He also spoke candidly and at length about the mental health struggles he faced in the aftermath of his mom’s death. “I was so angry with what happened to her and the fact that there was no justice at all…the same people that chased her through that tunnel photographed her dying on the back seat of that car.”

He shared his memories of the funeral: “It was like I was outside my body and just walking along doing what was expected of me. Showing one-tenth of the emotion that everyone else was showing.” Looking at the sobbing crowds he thought “This is my mum. You haven’t even met her.”

Demand for talent is being partly fueled by the number of bankers moving to become chief financial officers of corporate clients – this year alone Vijay Karwal Nomura’s head of healthcare investment banking Chao Lu previously Citigroup’s head of Asia healthcare investment banking Jeremy Choy the head of technology mergers and acquisitions at HSBC and Yang Ruo a managing director in Citigroup’s TMT team have all made the switch.

A big factor in the moves is the opportunity to help build a company and in some cases help steer it to a public market listing. This plays to a banker’s strengths in corporate finance plus there is considerable upside in terms of remuneration.

Senior bankers are well paid but they can earn multiples of their salary by having skin in the game and guiding a company to an initial public offering.

But not all bankers want to join corporates and not all moves work out. That’s because taking a CFO role means a banker goes from working on multiple deals and being in the flow of transactions to taking a more strategic role.

Karwal has managed to get the best of both worlds with a new dual role. This week he was appointed CFO of biopharmaceutical company AffaMed Therapeutics based in Shanghai. At the same time he was also appointed operating partner of Singapore headquartered CBC Group (formerly C-Bridge Capital) a founding shareholder and funding partner in AffaMed.

CBC is one of the most active investors in the healthcare sector in Asia and this additional role means Karwal can execute his CFO duties for AffaMed while remaining in Hong Kong at the coal-face of dealmaking. “Bankers are so used to being involved in many different projects and they may lose that if they move to a corporate. But this role gives me the best of both worlds. Whereas AffaMed is the core focus and responsibility I’ll continue to be able to leverage my network and experience to support CBC in sourcing deal-flow” Karwal told eFinancialCareers.

Karwal has moved between banking and the corporate world before during his 25-year career. Prior to joining Nomura as Head of Healthcare Investment Banking for the Asia (ex-Japan) region in 2018 he was Asia Pacific Chief Development Officer as well as General Manager of China operations for DaVita Inc the international provider of kidney care services. He joined DaVita from Royal Bank of Scotland where he was the Asia Head of Consumer Retail & Healthcare coverage and before that was Head of Healthcare Banking in North America at ABN AMRO.

The 10th annual event will be held rain or shine at the Dayton Oak Park on Saturday. It is sponsored by the Dayton Community Club.

People can plan to compete in a bags tournament; kids can show off their leg strength at the kid’s pedal tractor pull; or try to find that perfect bargain attending the city wide garage sales or visiting the city’s shops.

The highlight of the day however is Old Engine Day show which will be held from 11 a.m. – 2 p.m. The show is open to anything including old engines classic cars restored tractors hotrods jeeps and more.

The show is free to attend for both spectators as well as exhibitors with the first 100 entries receiving a dash plaque.

Spectators are encouraged to vote for their favorite vehicle and tractor and a “people’s choice” award will be presented at the closing of the show.

Show organizers are anticipating close to 100 entries this year.

“We have better attendance every year” said Nate Stevens who is helping to organize the show. “We get more cars and spectators each year. It has gone up steadily.”

John Skoglund who is also helping to spearhead the event said because Dayton is a farming community show goers can expect to see a good number of restored antique tractors but in recent years cars have been gaining in numbers.

He is anticipating nearby families bringing their collection of John Deere and International tractors as well as another blast from the past some from the Dayton area may remember.

“Leroy Jones will be bringing his restored racecars that back in the ’60s were raced on the track here” said Skoglund.

Children ages 4 to 11 are invited to compete in the kids’ tractor pull. Register by 12:30 p.m. for the 1 p.m. pull.

There is a raffle for a custom painted pedal car and a 4430 John Deere pedal tractor. Proceeds from the raffle help to keep the pedal tractor pull a free event.

Sign up for the bags tournament is at the club house. The event starts at 3 p.m. Registration is $10 per team with a 100% payout and prizes awarded.

Although this is the 10th annual Dayton Old Engine Day the history of the event goes back 40 years or more.

Skoglund said the occasion was believed to have been started in the late 1970s or early 1980s and ran up until the mid-1990s or so.

“It was originally held downtown” he said. “I was sad when it ended. I don’t know how many years it lapsed in between but now we have it back and running again and it is gaining momentum.”

The location of the show was moved from downtown to Oak Park due to that growth.

“Having moved it out to Oak Park has really helped us because there is a lot more area shade trees and shelter houses” he added.

However just because the majority of the fest ivies are being held at the park Skoglund encourages people to visit downtown Dayton – especially the old Dayton light plant.

There people can not only visit what is now the Dayton Museum but the old engine that once helped to power the town of Dayton.

“We always show off our engine in the old light plant – one of the generator engines – that has been a large draw for years of the Old Engine Day” said Skoglund.

The Fairbanks Morse model 32E12; three-cylinder; 12 bore x 15 stroke; 277 rpm; 118 kw; 180 horsepower motor was installed at the Dayton Light Plant back in 1939. It was last used to help power the city of Dayton during the ice storm in 1991.

“It has always been a big draw. People always wanted to see the old engine. It is the original motor put in 1939. There was two of them. This is a three-cylinder and there was one-cylinder. A two-cylinder was put in later” said Kenny Sanders one of the original organizers of the Dayton Old Engine Day.

In 1959 a new motor was installed and 10 years later Sanders said the light plant was shut down.

But that 1939 engine that had been sitting idle for some time came to the rescue during the Halloween ice storm of 1991 – as did Sanders.

Sanders a well-known diesel mechanic from Dayton was summoned that cold icy night.

“When the ice storm came through somewhere around midnight I got a call. The exact statement was ‘help'” he said.

Sanders rushed to the light plant and knew he had a lot of work ahead of him.

“They hadn’t ran those engines for quite some time. The light plant was in disarray. They are supposed to have water circulating through them 365 days a year. The water wasn’t circulating because there was no electricity. The air was down. No one had maintained the air and it takes air to start them. I had a gas fired air compressor and I got enough air and I got that little motor started around five in the morning” said Sanders. “Then I got enough heat in there I got another motor started. We ran five days here in town on those motors.”

And that motor hasn’t ran since.

“It is still there for people to see” said Sanders. “When we decided to make the light plant into a museum I said we are going to keep that motor because it saved the town in 1991.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vc2VyaWVzL2hhcmQtcmVzZXQvdmVydGljYWwtZmFybWluZ9IBQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vc2VyaWVzL2hhcmQtcmVzZXQvdmVydGljYWwtZmFybWluZz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vertical farms could take over the world,"As the global population continues to increase vertical farming is becoming a more widely recognized and viable solution to our food production problem. Vertical farming is a type of indoor farming where crops are grown in stacked layers rather than spread out across large plots of land.

These futuristic farms aren’t just going to have an impact on how we survive here on Earth; they could also enable us to create a food source beyond our planet without a dependence on the outdoor climate or arable land.

Although the task sounds unimaginable developments in controlled environment agriculture are proving that it is very much possible. Adopting these sustainable farming practices could lead to a monumental shift in how we produce food both for today and the future of humanity.

Vertical Farming Advantages

Vertical farms offer many benefits over traditional farming practices — an increased crop yield with a smaller land requirement more control over the resulting flavor and cleanliness of crops and the prospect of better access to healthy foods in underserved communities to name a few.

Because these farms are constructed completely indoors using LED lights their output isn’t subject to the natural elements that typically affect plant production such as adverse weather insects and seasons.

They’re better for the environment because they require less energy and put out less pollution without a need for heavy machinery pesticides or fertilizers. Vertical farms often use soil-less farming methods like aquaponics hydroponics and aeroponics which requires just 10% of the amount of water consumed by conventional outdoor farms.

Think of a vertical farm as a plant factory — one that enables farmers to predictably grow anything anywhere from strawberries to kale. The idea was first introduced in 1999 by Dickson Despommier a professor at Columbia University. Despommier and his students came up with designs for a “skyscraper farm” that could feed 50000 people. Though the structure has yet to be built they successfully managed to popularize the ideology behind vertical farming systems.

So why wasn’t the skyscraper farm ever built? The answer sheds light on one of the most prominent vertical farming disadvantages — cost. A single farm can cost a hundred million dollars to construct and a lack of data surrounding the long-term economic feasibility of vertical farms has caused some investors to shy away.

However this hasn’t stopped vertical farmers from persisting to disrupt the food production industry. Vertical farming has already been adopted in countries like China Japan and other parts of Asia. In fact the market for vertical farming in that region is expected to increase 24% by 2026. And in the U.S. some vertical farming companies are already selling their produce in stores.

More Produce With Less Resources

One of those companies is Plenty headquartered in San Francisco California. Plenty was founded in 2014 by Matt Barnard and Nate Storey with a simple yet powerful mission to improve the lives of plants people and the planet.

Plenty already has established vertical farms in the San Francisco Bay Area Wyoming and Washington. These farms supply fresh produce including kale arugula and lettuce to major grocery stores like Whole Foods and Safeway.

The team at Plenty recently began construction on a new farm in the Bay Area that they call Tigris. Tigris will be its largest and most efficient farm yet capable of growing a million plants at a time.

With Plenty’s vertical farming technology 700 acres of farmland can be condensed into a structure the size of a big-box store. Plenty’s farms harvest 365 days per year and shrink growth cycles to about 10 days for many of their products.

This results in a yield increase of about 700% as compared to traditional farming all while saving about a million gallons of water per week and using just one percent of the land that traditional farms use.

The secret to this astronomical efficiency lies in the technology. Plenty’s farms are equipped with air handling units that capture transpired water allowing them to recirculate 99% of the water back into the system. They also use LED light bulbs and seeking to be as efficient as possible the bulbs are designed in a grid format that maximizes the amount of energy absorbed by the plants.

These systems allow farm operators to have more control over their crop yield — all the way down to a plant’s flavor profile. Blue LED lighting for example can create a crispier crunch in kale leaves. Additionally without a need for pesticides their products are completely organic.

“When you grow things outside the elements are much more unpredictable” Shireen Santosham the head of strategic initiatives for Plenty explains. “If you grow indoors you can control a lot of those factors in ways that are accessible to outdoor growers. And the result is that our produce can be hundreds of times cleaner.”

Not only is the produce cleaner it’s also higher quality. Because Plenty’s products are grown in urban areas and don’t have to be shipped across the country the brand doesn’t have to prioritize shelf life. Less transportation needs also reduces their carbon footprint.

What could all of this mean for the future? That every place in the world regardless of climate could sustainably grow the same nutrient-rich and flavorful crops. And it could someday result in the colonization of other planets as well.

“We can give the world back — a lot” says Storey. “We can give the world back land. We can give back the jungles of Borneo to the orangutans. We can give back the Amazon to the planet. We can give back the midwest to the buffalo. We can give back the things that we’ve taken. And we can be a lot less extractive.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90cmlibGl2ZS12YWxsZXktbmV3cy1kaXNwYXRjaC9uYW1lL2NlY2lsLXNsZWUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9OTY2NzMxOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cecil Slee Obituary (1945 - 2021) - Buffalo Township PA - The Valley News Dispatch,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/triblive-valley-news-dispatch/name/cecil-slee-obituary?id=9667319 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90cmlibGl2ZS12YWxsZXktbmV3cy1kaXNwYXRjaC9uYW1lL2NlY2lsLXNsZWUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9OTY2NzMxOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vc2lvdXhjaXR5am91cm5hbC5jb20vbW9ybmluZ3NpZGVzLW1hdHRoZXktd2lucy1uYXRpb25hbC10aXRsZS9hcnRpY2xlXzhhY2QwMzdiLTdjNjItNTY2OC05MWMzLWIyNGNjMWU3Zjg1Zi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morningside's Matthey wins national title,"SILVIS Ill. -- The way things turned out not even Corey Matthey could have written a better script.

Trailing by a shot with four holes to go the Morningside College senior birdied three of the final four holes at mighty TPC Deere Run emerging as NAIA national champion.

Matthey a Sergeant Bluff-Luton High School product was the only golfer to break par in the grueling 72-hole event played at the site of the PGA Tour’s John Deere Classic.

He finished at 4-under 280 battling through all kinds of different weather conditions to become the first Morningside golfer ever to earn first-team All-America status.

“I’ll take that” Matthey said. “Five years of golf at Morningside and end it like that. (Coach Todd) Sapp’s last tournament my last tournament it was pretty special.”

Matthey entered Friday’s final round with a four-shot lead over a couple of players but struggled on his front nine shooting 4-over-par. In fact he made another bogey on No. 11 slipping to 5-over for the day.

He admitted that he was battling nerves to begin with.

“It was a feeling that I haven’t gotten playing in tournaments around here” Matthey said. “There were players from all over the world. It rained for a few holes on my front nine and I had some nerves going. I had never felt that before so it was obviously good exposure.

“I pretty much knew where I stood going into the last four holes. I played probably the best four holes of my life coming down the stretch.”

Matthey made birdie on No. 15 followed by a good par on No. 16. Then came another birdie on the par-5 17th but he still had to conquer the toughest hole on the golf course.

“It’s the hardest golf hole I’ve ever played in my life” Matthey said. “It was into the wind trouble everywhere. I was playing for par had a 15-foot birdie putt and it went in.”

Meanwhile Logan Scott of William Woods (Mo.) -- the tournament leader after the second round – slipped up with a double bogey on the 16th hole. Matthey wound up winning by four over Smith and Ben Rebne of Dalton State (Ga.) who each finished at even-par 284.

What made this even more special was the fact that Morningside Coach Todd Sapp had previously announced that he would retire at the end of the 2020-21 season. Sapp walked the final hole with Matthey.

“It was a special moment ” Sapp said. “I was focusing on all year knowing that I was going to retire. There was a job to do all the way until the last hole but once he hit it in there to about 12 feet on 18 it was a nice walk up to the green with him.

“No. 16 the par 3 was the first time we let him know where he stood. He was one stroke behind with three to go but he had just birdied 15 a difficult par-4 into the wind. We knew he could probably reach 17 in two and birdie that and at least tie.

“No. 18 is such a tough hole all week he had trouble getting his drive in play there. Everyone makes bogey or higher on that hole it’s into the wind and wet. We had talked about it after 17 that he was going to have to man up and hit a golf shot. It was as focused and motivated he’s probably ever been on the 18th tee. He hadn’t hit the fairway all week but had his best drive a perfect little cut off the bunker that he had to have.

“The iron shot was into the wind and if he turned probably a two-yard draw it’s going into the water. There was a lot of anxiety he was feeling at that point. I know Corey and he was trying to do this for himself for the college and for me. He told me he’d never felt that much pressure before it was a totally different scenario. He birdied 15 17 and 18 when it really wasn’t looking good.”

Matthey shot 2-under 69 in the first round with a steady rain falling most of the day. That was good enough for a tie for first with two others including Logan Smith.

Smith fired a 65 in the second round matching the lowest 36-hole score in tournament history with a 134. He led Matthey—who shot 68 -- by three shots heading into the third round.

However while Matthey was carding a 70 in the third round Smith slipped to 77 giving Matthey the four-shot cushion with 18 holes to play.

“In the third round about the middle of the round I started sensing I had a pretty good chance of being in close contention” Matthey said. “It was hard to get my mind off golf during the night but when I got that golf club in my hand Friday morning I felt way more comfortable the nerves kind of subsided. I’m glad I handled it in a decent manner.”

Teammate Tanner Haeberle was caddying for Matthey in the final round before Sapp joined the duo for the walk up the 18th fairway. Family members were also on hand to lend their support.

“My dad (Mike Matthey) has coached me since I was three years old so it was very special for he and I as well” Matthey said.

Although this is the crowning point of his career Matthey plans to play a few more tournaments in his home state before departing for Arizona in August the next step that he hopes will one day lead him to the PGA Tour.

He’ll hit the min-tours in hopes that he can eventually qualify for the Korn Ferry Tour the last step before the “big time.”

“I want to be in those big spots competing with the best so the last four days have been good for me” Matthey said. “It taught me how to handle a pressure situation on the course with a lot on the line.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcGxhaW5zbWFuLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2Zhcm0tcmVzY3VlLXBsYW50cy1zb3liZWFucy1mb3ItZ2V5ZXItZmFtaWx5LDIyNTY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farm Rescue plants soybeans for Geyer family - The Daily Plainsman,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://plainsman.com/stories/farm-rescue-plants-soybeans-for-geyer-family,22567 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcGxhaW5zbWFuLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2Zhcm0tcmVzY3VlLXBsYW50cy1zb3liZWFucy1mb3ItZ2V5ZXItZmFtaWx5LDIyNTY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are making their top flyers earn elite status this year.

But both are making it easier to reach the top levels of their frequent flyer programs.

Average travelers now have a better chance at getting status and the perks that come with it.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The upper echelons of airline frequent flyer programs have historically been reserved for airlines' most frequent flyers and top spenders. But airlines eager to get their top flyers back in the air are making it easier for more travelers to reach the coveted levels of status and all the perks that come with it.

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have rolled out new programs that help speed along the process. And the result will be flyers spending fewer dollars and less time in the air in order to join or renew their membership in the elite status club.

Delta is giving all of its SkyMiles members 50 percent more of the qualifying credits needed to earn elite status. Currently flyers need to fly a certain amount of miles while also spending a certain amount of money with the airline to achieve elite status.

The minimum spending amount to earn elite status on Delta known as ""minimum qualifying dollars"" or MQDs is $3000. A flyer will also have to fly at least 25000 miles known as ""minimum qualifying miles"" or MQMs or 30 flight segments known as ""minimum qualifying segments"" or MQS to qualify.

Flyers booking tickets in economy will earn 50 percent more MQDs MQMs and MQSs with each flight. Those that pay more for Delta Comfort+ Delta One business class first class or Premium Select premium economy seats will earn 75 percent more of each category.

Delta customers that book their tickets using SkyMiles also known as award tickets will also earn credits towards qualifying for status. Award tickets are traditionally exempt from counting towards status on most airlines because no revenue is being earned so this is a major shift from Delta.

Tickets that are purchased using a combination of cash and miles will also count towards qualification.

Delta's is largely egalitarian and even members on the lowest rung of the elite status ladder – known as Silver Medallion – can be upgraded to first class on any domestic US flight if seats are available.

Insider put Delta's elite status to the test during the pandemic and received over $800 in upgrades across three flights alone including an upgrade to Delta One business class on a flight from Los Angeles to New York.

Other perks of earning elite status with Delta include a free checked bag access to priority check-in and boarding lines dedicated phone lines and complimentary lounge access depending on the level of status.

United's MileagePlus program is similar to Delta's where flyers have to earn a certain number of premier qualifying points or PQPs while also flying a certain number of flights to qualify for elite status. Those thresholds were lowered by United in November however to make elite status more easily attainable.

Attaining Premier Silver status for example only requires 3000 PQPs and eight flights. That's down from 4000 PQPs and 12 flights.







All MileagePlus members will earn bonus PQPs for their first three trips to kickstart the process while existing Premier members received 25 percent of the PQPs required for their status level at the beginning of the year.

From there MileagePlus Premier members had an opportunity to pick between receiving another 25 percent of the required PQPs for their status level after three trips or have 10 percent of the required PQPs deposited with no travel required. The latter option was meant for flyers that didn't plan on flying before the promotion's expiration date.

United offers a similar upgrade model to Delta where any elite status holder can receive an upgrade if there are seats on most domestic flights. Additional perks of having elite status with United include a free checked bag access to priority check-in and boarding lines and dedicated phone lines.

Both models make it easier for all flyers to earn elite status while United's is slightly geared toward helping existing elite flyers keep their status. Both strategies differ however from last year when airlines simply extended status levels through 2021.

But now airlines are giving frequent flyers a reason to get back in the air and start flying again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY3VzbGFicy1pbmRvb3ItYWlycG9ydC1tYXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Behind the scenes of the company that creates the indoor airport map,"""Welcome to Chicago! It takes about 9 minutes to get to Gate B3"" read a text message I recently received from United Airlines.

I was flying from Bozeman Montana to New York and had an hour layover in the Windy City. Upon landing at O'Hare the notification came through just as I reconnected to the cell tower. It even included a customized hyperlink to step-by-step walking directions to get to my connecting gate.

This latest technology is part of United's new ConnectionSaver tool which also helps the airline identify whether it should hold flights for connecting travelers. The tool is powered in part by the airline's partnership with LocusLabs an indoor mapping company that specializes in airports and large retail centers.

But LocusLabs does more to streamline the day-of-travel experience than just helping you make your connection.

The Oakland-based company owned by parent Acuity Brands launched in 2014 and has since mapped 120 of the world's largest airports. It licenses its maps to more than 45 airports and airlines including American Delta United and others in the U.S. and Emirates Lufthansa and more globally.

Odds are that if you've pulled up an airport map you've interacted with LocusLabs' technology. I recently sat down with the team at LocusLabs to learn more about their product how they map airports and what that means for the travel experience.

How LocusLabs is transforming the travel experience

LocusLabs' maps make it easier to navigate some of the world's largest airports.

They're easy to read and include every point of interest you'll encounter along the travel journey including check-in counters security lanes concessions restrooms lounges and gate areas. But that's not all — the company told TPG that its goal is to map everything on offer including charging areas water bottle refill stations and even defibrillators.

""If it's there we're displaying it"" Matt Thomas a LocusLabs program manager said to TPG. Over the past year that meant adding in countless hand sanitizing stations personal protective equipment vending machines and on-site COVID-19 test locations at airports worldwide.

""LocusLabs's airport partners rely on our mapping technology to help their passengers not only navigate the airport but find points of interest too. Whether they're looking for an item a store or a specific location in the terminal real-time wayfinding can lead them where they want to go"" Thomas continued.

In addition to showing all relevant points of interest the maps can be updated in real-time — meaning that if a store changes its operating hours in response to the pandemic it can be instantly reflected across all maps within minutes.

""LocusLabs was founded on a commitment to delivering practical day-of-travel data and the pandemic magnified the need for precision"" said Lucas Verret a LocusLabs product manager. ""Access to accurate real-time data is crucial for passengers airport staff and airline employees... Giving travelers the ability to find a specific last-minute item... close to their boarding gate reassures them they can solve a problem—or explore the airport—without worrying about missing their flight.""

It's not just about the details within existing airports. Even for brand-new facilities LocusLabs told TPG that its goal is to have the new terminals and concourses fully mapped by the grand opening. The team was there on day one in the new Washington Reagan National terminal as well as new concourses in Nashville New Orleans and Salt Lake City.

Another nifty feature is that the maps integrate live security wait times.

Once you've arrived at the airport the map can show you turn-by-turn directions to your gate including an ETA that factors in security times. All you need to do is select which security lane you'll use: general TSA Precheck Clear or preferred/elite and time will be adjusted accordingly.

Many airports require navigating stairs and escalators. LocusLabs built an accessible routing feature for flyers who use wheelchairs as well as families traveling with strollers. Instead of showing you the fastest way to get to the gate your journey will be re-routed to exclusively use elevators and ramps.

It starts with a baby stroller equipped with cameras

To map an airport LocusLabs sends CJ Lucero around the world with its proprietary Map Toddler the company's reality capture system.

This device about the size of a projector fits on top of a modified stroller and is rolled around the airport to create a rough map of any given terminal. Dubbed the ""Map Toddler"" it was designed to be small enough that Lucero could bring it on planes as his carry-on luggage.

It captures data through seven sensors — three cameras two light-detecting scanners one motion sensor and GPS — which is used by the data processing team to actually build the final map.

The Map Toddler has a roughly two-hour battery life though Lucero travels with plenty of spares. It took Lucero just about two full days — and well over 20000 steps — to map all of JFK's six terminals.

Delta LaGuardia airport share success stories

During the pandemic Delta unveiled COVID-tested flights to Italy and the Netherlands. Flyers need to get a series of COVID-19 tests both before and after departure one of which is administered at the airport right before takeoff.

Thanks to LocusLabs' real-time updates Delta quickly added the COVID-19 test site to the airport map and those booked on the flight were quickly directed to the center all without leaving the Fly Delta mobile app.

""Our vision for the Fly Delta App is rooted in eliminating stresses from the customer journey. Our partnership with LocusLabs gives us the technology and insights we need to guide customers throughout their day of travel. In addition to offering interactive maps at key airports we are listening to customers to find new ways to reduce pain points using the Fly Delta App – like estimating wait times to pass through security or quick access to need-to-know information at the airport and more"" Jonathan Mayfield manager of the Fly Delta mobile app said in a statement to TPG.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which oversees JFK Newark and LaGuardia is one of LocusLabs' newest customers but agency officials say they're already impressed. When Spirit Airlines split its operations to two terminals at New York LaGuardia on April 28 the airport map was updated at 3 a.m. local time with the change.

By keeping the map updated in real-time the Port Authority was able to minimize disruption for passengers. Those who checked the were seamlessly directed to the appropriate terminal.

""The Port Authority and its partners are committed to cutting-edge technology not just in response to the COVID-19 pandemic but as a long-term investment in enhancing the passenger journey"" Port Authority executive director Rick Cotton said in a statement to TPG. ""From terminal navigation to biometric technology and touchless self-service to eGates and improvements in the airports' mobile apps we want to assure that our airports utilize the constantly growing capabilities of 21st-century technology to improve the travel experience for our customers.""

So next time you travel be sure to take a peek at the airport map. Whether you're looking for a burger or a last-minute gift you'll find it — at least if the map was created by LocusLabs."

The money would plug hundreds of abandoned wells and restore the often-polluted land surrounding them and in the process would employ oilfield workers who had been furloughed after prices crashed.

The program largely accomplished those goals. But some environmental advocates say it achieved another they didn’t expect: It bailed out dozens of small to mid-sized oil companies relieving them of their responsibility to pay for cleaning up their own wells by using taxpayer money instead.

Oil drillers are generally required to plug their wells after they’re done producing crude. But in practice companies are often able to defer that responsibility for years or decades. Larger companies often sell older wells to smaller ones which sometimes go bankrupt leaving the wells with no owner.

These “orphaned wells” become the responsibility of the federal or state governments depending on where they were drilled. While oil companies are required to post bonds or other financial assurance to pay for plugging them in reality those bonds cover only a tiny fraction of the costs leaving taxpayers on the hook. One estimate by the Carbon Tracker Initiative a financial think tank found that those bonds cover only a tiny fraction of the expected costs of cleaning up the nation’s oil and gas wells.

But in North Dakota it turned out that most of the wells the state plugged were not truly orphaned but had solvent owners. After the industry warned last year that the pandemic-driven oil-crash was threatening its finances state regulators stepped in assumed ownership of more than 300 wells and used CARES Act funds to plug them meaning the companies avoided paying anything themselves.

“What happened was a bunch of people got a free ride” said Scott Skokos executive director of the Dakota Resource Council a grassroots environmental group in the state.

Skokos said it only deepened his sense that the state had bailed out the industry. In October regulators were granted permission from state lawmakers to send about $16 million of the CARES Act funds as grants to oil companies to help them buy water to hydraulically fracture new wells a step the regulators said was necessary to expend the funds by the end of the year. Nine companies took advantage of the program. In one case a single company Continental Resources received $5.4 million according to state records.

Wyoming also sent about $30 million in Covid relief funds to oil companies as grants to either frack new wells or revive or plug old ones.

Some advocates say that such well-plugging programs highlight a larger problem: Millions of aging unplugged oil and gas wells dot the ground from Appalachia to California often carrying oil and toxins to the surface contaminating groundwater and leaking climate-warming methane gas into the atmosphere.

The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the nation’s unplugged wells leaked about 263000 tons of methane in 2019 which when compared to carbon dioxide over a 20-year period is equivalent to the climate-warming emissions of more than 5 coal-fired power plants. The agency added that the actual figure could be significantly smaller or three times greater.

While many of the wells—hundreds of thousands at least—are orphaned many more are still operated by oil companies that critics say have avoided plugging them because of regulations that allow the industry to postpone cleaning them indefinitely eventually dumping the responsibility on taxpayers.

President Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan calls for spending $16 billion to clean up the nation’s orphaned wells and coal and hardrock mines and lawmakers have drafted bills with similar goals.

Environmentalists leaders in both political parties and the oil industry all support directing federal dollars to plug orphaned wells as a way to address climate change and pollution while creating jobs for oilfield workers. But some advocates say that what happened in North Dakota shows the risks of spending billions of dollars without sufficient scrutiny and without requiring oil companies to put up more money to pay for plugging their wells.

“There’s an incredible opportunity to begin cleaning up and better cataloging orphan wells while creating well-paying jobs” said Sara Cawley a legislative representative for Earthjustice an environmental nonprofit. But she said any federal spending needs to be tied with regulatory reforms including requiring companies to set aside more money for plugging “so that taxpayers are not continuing to pay for clean-up in perpetuity.”

Two bills have been introduced so far. Both would direct billions of dollars to plug orphaned wells on state federal and tribal lands and both include language that would encourage states to improve well-plugging regulations by tying a portion of the funding to reforms. Only one however by Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) would require oil companies to purchase more expensive bonds when drilling on federal land leaving more money available in case of default.

Lynn Helms director of North Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources defended the state’s program from criticism that it bailed out the industry saying it targeted companies that were facing financial stress because of last year’s crash in oil prices and that in some cases small mom-and-pop operations did not have the funds to plug the wells. He said his department has begun to pursue reimbursement from some of the companies that are still solvent and has already obtained more than $3 million to reimburse a state well-plugging fund that covered some costs beyond the $66 million from the CARES Act.

He said the program served the intent of the CARES Act—to stimulate the economy and support employment—by creating more than 3700 jobs “and that was the number one purpose for why we did this.”

Helms said the $16 million in grants for fracking was also intended to support workers and state finances which are highly dependent on tax revenues from oil production. The grants he said supported about 600 jobs and boosted production in December shoring up funding for schools and other programs. While he acknowledged that Continental and other companies were essentially given a multi-million dollar discount “that wasn’t the purpose” he said.

Some environmental advocates have countered that whatever the intent North Dakota effectively gave the oil industry a backdoor subsidy and sent an implicit signal that taxpayers will come to its rescue when times are tough.

“In North Dakota I think the story is in some ways a fairly succinct one” said Nikki Reisch director of the climate and energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law which highlighted the state’s program in a recent report. “Taxpayer dollars were being used to pick up polluters’ tabs while at the same the state was repurposing federal funds to support new fracking making the very same problem worse.”

’Pollution Vectors’

No one knows how many old wells are scattered across the nation’s oil and gas fields. According to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission states have identified nearly 57000 orphaned wells but estimate there are hundreds of thousands more undocumented ones. The EPA has estimated there are more than 3 million abandoned wells regardless of whether they have owners or not. Often companies can avoid plugging wells when they are no longer productive by calling them idled a status that can last decades.

Locally old wells can contaminate groundwater and foul farmland spewing not only petroleum but also toxic highly salty water. Abandoned well sites render sections of farmers’ fields unusable.

Companies are generally required to purchase bonds when they drill wells as a form of insurance—governments can confiscate the bonds if companies fail to plug their own wells. Lawmakers or regulators determine the levels for those bonds—for example $10000 per well or $150000 for all a company’s wells within a state—but in many cases those levels were set decades ago and barely begin to cover plugging costs.

Carbon Tracker has collected data on more than 2.4 million catalogued unplugged wells including all the nation’s active wells and has estimated it would cost about $288 billion to plug them. But its analysis showed that state and federal bonds would cover only about 1 percent of that cost raising the question of who will pay the difference if companies go bankrupt or fail to plug their wells. That estimate for the coverage of bonds excluded Texas for which Carbon Tracker was unable to obtain data. Last week New Mexico’s State Land Office released a report that found that oil company bonds in the state covered 2 percent of the expected cleanup costs falling $8.1 billion short.

Rob Schuwerk executive director of Carbon Tracker’s North American office said the looming transition away from oil and gas will make the problem worse. It is one thing if industry revenues are stable or growing and companies only occasionally bail on their cleanup responsibilities. But if oil and gas demand begins to decline the industry is likely to face falling revenues and a spike in bankruptcies just as companies abandon a wave of unprofitable wells. They might not have money to plug their own wells leaving taxpayers on the hook.

Last year served as a preview when global lockdowns sent oil demand plummeting. In North Dakota that meant oil companies had to shut their wells and layoff workers as their revenues dwindled.

The conditions prompted warnings of bankruptcies and led regulators to ask the state to spend CARES Act relief funds on plugging and remediating abandoned wells which they warned could become orphaned if not addressed.

In order to plug the wells the state had to assume ownership of them a step that was welcomed by Ron Ness who runs the North Dakota Petroleum Council which represents the industry. But at a state hearing last year Ness warned regulators against also seizing the bonds companies had bought as insurance for plugging the wells. Although the bonds might help pay plugging costs seizing them would have “very real” impacts that would prove to be “extremely problematic” Ness said.

Ness argued that the CARES Act was effectively reimbursing the state for the cost of plugging the wells. If regulators did seize the bonds he argued the state could have to return funds to the federal government.

The petroleum council did not respond to phone messages or emails. But Schuwerk said that confiscating a bond could pose problems for the company that purchased it. Bond companies could suddenly view that company as a risk and require it to pay higher premiums for its other bonds for example driving up drilling costs.

Regulators have largely granted Ness’s request at least so far. According to data provided by the Department of Mineral Resources the state confiscated 320 wells and had plugged 280 as of May at a cost of $39.3 million including $6.1 million that came from a state well-plugging fund financed with industry fees and penalties and taxes on production. The state “reclaimed”—or cleaned up—only 173 of the sites.

But so far the state has confiscated bonds worth only about $3.4 million while it is pursuing another $1.5 million through civil action Helms said. All of that money would go to reimburse the state fund rather than the CARES Act money. Helms said that while they are still looking into it the rules of the CARES Act may dictate that the state cannot or should not reimburse the federal government.

The department said that seven companies responsible for 77 of the confiscated wells have either entered bankruptcy or were determined to be insolvent. The rest of the wells however were owned by companies that continue to pump oil in the state.

Cobra Oil and Gas for example had 121 wells confiscated. State records say the Texas-based company has another 369 active wells suggesting there may have been revenue to cover plugging costs. Cobra did not respond to phone messages or emails.

Helms said companies like Cobra “are not off the hook” adding “I don’t think I can tell you that we’re going to pursue full reimbursement but I think I can commit we’re going to pursue at least some reimbursement from those companies.”

Helms said the North Dakota Legislature has made changes in bonding and regulations in recent years that are intended to prevent the 14000 wells that have been drilled in North Dakota over the past decade from facing a similar fate. Wells that have been idled for 18 months for example are now required to have dedicated bonds rather than being covered by a “blanket bond” for all of a company’s wells in the state.

Wyoming also sent CARES Act funds as grants to oil companies which they could use to frack wells they had already drilled or to plug older wells. According to data provided by the Wyoming Business Council which administered the funds Devon Energy received nearly $5.8 million which it used both to frack new wells and plug old ones. Six other companies including Occidental Petroleum received more than $1 million each.

Randall Luthi chief energy advisor to Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement to Inside Climate News that the spending was “completely appropriate” adding that thousands of people in the state were unable to find work last year. He said the program provided “an economic and environmental shot in the arm for Wyoming at a time when it was needed” and that “CARES money was always intended for solvent but struggling companies.”

Neither Devon Occidental nor Continental Resources responded to requests for comment.

Skokos of the Dakota Resource Council said he supported cleaning up old wells but that the way it was administered was “basically a bailout for the industry.”

“We could have been using that money for other things like paid family leave or money for actual workers increasing unemployment” he said. “There’s people that were struggling.”

Adam Peltz a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund said it was unlikely that any federal efforts to plug orphaned wells would be spent on wells with solvent owners as it was in North Dakota and Wyoming.

“The overwhelming vast majority of this money will be spent on pre-regulatory wells that really have not a trace of an owner on record” he said. Pennsylvania Ohio and other eastern states where some of the first oil wells were drilled for example have hundreds of thousands of orphaned wells and little funding to plug them. “And they’re just going to sit there as pollution vectors” Peltz said “until and unless we come up with a lot of money to plug them. The good news is we’re in a moment where money is flowing for good causes.”

He noted that some states including North Dakota have also begun to improve their bonding requirements.

But Reisch of the Center for International Environmental Law warned that those changes have hardly begun closing the gap.

“The looming legacy of the oil and gas industry and of the fossil fuel economy is really going to be this ghost infrastructure and these toxic wells” she said. “The magnitude of the problem and the funds needed to address it properly is really daunting.”

A plan to preserve the picturesque seaside town of Teignmouth but to have a sustainable future is out for consultation.

The Teignmouth Neighbourhood Plan which aims to provide a vision for the town for the next 20 years outlines how the residents wish to ensure it remains a thriving town with a healthy and unpolluted environment set in a protected coastal and estuarine setting.

There are 30 aims listed in the plan concerning topics ranging from housing the future of the town centre sport and leisure provision traffic and parking and flood prevention with a ‘golden thread’ of climate change running throughout all the policies listed.

Cllr Joan Atkins chairman of the Neighbourhood Plan Steering Group in the foreword to the plan said: “On the surface Teignmouth is a picturesque seaside town in South Devon but underneath that first impression it is far more than that. It is a complex town with a long history and many facets and styles which have been moulded by the hands of time fashions in design and the topography and limitations of its location

“We very much hope and intend that this will facilitate appropriate future development in the town taking into account a response to climate change requirements of heritage conservation and most recently the impact and response required by the Pandemic.

""We will never be able to please all the people all the time particularly as the goalposts keep moving but we hope we have produced a balanced even aspirational view after our many discussions within the many limitations of what we can legally achieve through a Neighbourhood Plan.”

The vision statement says: “In 2040 Teignmouth will be a sustainable thriving town with a healthy and unpolluted environment set in a protected coastal and estuarine setting. It will have a high-quality public realm with all new developments meeting high standards of design and sustainability good community sports and recreational facilities for all ages and abilities a diverse economy with opportunities to work from home or in business including the port retail tourism leisure art and culture and good transport facilities for pedestrians cyclists buses road vehicles railways and parking.”

THE 30 AIMS OF THE TEIGNMOUTH NEIGHBOURHOOD PLAN

The historic environment should be recognised and appropriately protected and enhanced.

New development should have a beneficial impact on the character and sustainability of the area and respond positively to the challenges of climate change.

Improve and maintain the public realm.

Provide more green space play areas trees and community horticulture opportunities in residential areas for reasons of health amenity quality of public realm and a response to climate change.

New development proposals should prove their sustainability credentials.

The rate of housing growth should be moderate and must not put a strain on local infrastructure.

New housing provision should address Teignmouth’s evidenced needs.

The impact of new housing development on its location should be physically aesthetically and socially beneficial and respond positively to the challenges of climate change.

Local green spaces that contribute to the amenity of their local area should be protected

Sports leisure and recreation facilities should be sufficient in quantity and quality to meet evidenced community needs.

Encourage recreational activity appropriate to the outstanding geographical location.

Local community facilities should be sufficient in quantity and quality to continue to meet community needs.

Opportunities for young people should be adequately addressed.

Ensure the local provision of quality education opportunities for all.

The town centre must remain the commercial and social heart of the area.

Continue to improve the appearance and amenity of the town centre and seafront.

Arts and cultural projects should be welcomed and promoted.

Appropriate improvements and enhancements to tourism facilities should be welcomed and encouraged.

Sustainable tourism development should be encouraged and actively pursued.

Sustainable transport modes should be encouraged and better facilitated.

The traffic & parking implications of new development should be fully recognised & addressed.

More parking should be provided.

Measures to address traffic problems and their implications should be introduced.

The countryside and natural coastal and estuarine areas should be safeguarded from the impact of development or over-use

Strategic gaps between settlement areas should be recognised and protected.

Public access to the countryside and coastline should be accommodated where it does not cause harm.

The sea wall groynes and other coastal and estuarine flood defences will be protected.

Business development that is in keeping with and enhances the town’s distinctiveness should be accommodated.

Encourage development that offers good quality employment opportunities.

Appropriate community-based renewable and low carbon energy initiatives are welcomed.

Rather than try to design a single planning policy about climate change and how mitigation and adaptation measures can be supported the authors of the plan have sought to “climate change proof” policies and community actions and projects which means the response to the changing climate is a “golden thread” running through the plan.

With Teignmouth being a coastal town partially reliant on tourism issues relating to climate change that will need to be addressed and mitigated the plan says include rising sea levels and flood risk from high tides including the impact on the seafront and resilience of the railway infrastructure the potential impact of flood risk and a changing climate on the local economy the impact on the retention of beaches and the impact of current levels of traffic on carbon dioxide emissions.

REGENERATION

Teignmouth has benefited from various regeneration projects in recent decades including the development of the Pavilions pedestrianisation of parts of the town centre and significant leisure play and recreation opportunities on The Den.

This is a path which has continued with plans to regenerate the Brunswick Street area but the plan says that regeneration and improvements in the town cannot stop there.

It says: “Maintaining and improving our built environment gives us the opportunity to enhance enjoyment and use of our spaces both civic spaces and green spaces which form the public realm improve ease of access and contribute to enhancing quality and attractiveness of the town.

“This is important not only as a contribution to the physical and mental health of residents and those working in the town but also to those who enjoy visiting Teignmouth. By influencing positive change to the built environment and protecting what we value the most we can also have an impact on the pressures from a changing climate and recovery from the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic.

“This Plan provides an opportunity for additional projects and changes to be made in a positive high-quality way and for any new development proposals to be designed in a way which protect and respect the quality aspects of our built environment while enhancing it through their contribution to it.

“Proposers of major development are encouraged to engage with the local community and Town Council at the earliest opportunity and proposals for major development will be required to follow a design review process prior to the submission of a planning application.”

NEW DEVELOPMENT

The plan indicates a clear preference for brownfield sites or infill sites to be developed over greenfield sites within Teignmouth but states that potential for this is limited to 35 units although this number could increase in the coming years if contraction of town centre uses occurs with vacant units converted to dwellings.

The Local Plan allocates two housing sites in Teignmouth - Higher Exeter Road and North of New Road – but since then other sites have come forward such as on land adjacent and to the west of the allocated site to the north of New Road.

“At the current time the population of the town looks likely to increase in the long-term and it is likely that we will continue to have an ageing population” the plan says. “House prices continue to rise in the town despite the coronavirus pandemic although there were local market signs of rises stabilising prior to the pandemic. Mortgages seem likely to continue to be out of the reach of most first-time buyers in Teignmouth particular with the impacts of the pandemic on job security hourly rates of pay and salaries.”

Development proposals for new dwellings within the defined settlement limit boundary will be supported in principle with preferred sites within the boundary will be on previously developed land on an infill site while dwellings which form “annexes” to existing properties will be supported in principle.

And the plan calls for ‘an appropriate growth and development rate’ for Teignmouth within strategic context of the Local Plan to ensure infrastructure capacity and needs are understood and appropriately addressed in good time to match the needs arising from development and to ensure new housing development addresses identified local needs from within the town and local affordability issues.

SPORTS LEISURE AND RECREATION

The plan calls for the protection of the use of existing sports leisure and recreation facilities and to take full advantage of water-side locations including the support for the provision of a centre for water sports and that the Teign Estuary Cycle Trail should be prioritised.

It says: “There are many businesses operating on both sides of the coastline servicing residents and visitors in the hospitality leisure and cultural sectors. The town is also fortunate with the town centre located close to the coastline. Polices seek to protect enhance and enable marine related activity along the coastline on the sea and estuary side For both operators within and users of the areas.

“The policy can help Teignmouth capitalise further on its assets while also seeking to protect the built and waterside environment from any adverse impact which could arise from development proposals and their use and endorses and supports a suggestion for development at Polly Steps for use as a watersports centre.

“At the current time there is only informal provision and infrastructure for watersports and there is a good opportunity to enhance the public slipway at Polly Steps by improving the slipway and providing a facility to more appropriately support and enable growth of watersports.

“This could include support for sports and activities such as stand-up paddleboarding rowing canoeing / kayaking open-water swimming and dinghy sailing. Such a facility could be a real asset to the town and enhance support for all age groups and including an educational and life-skills role for children and young people.

“The development of new and extension of existing facilities supporting marine-related leisure and sport activities that demonstrate benefits to the local economy on or adjacent to the beaches or Estuary will be supported in principle and opportunities should be taken to ensure that proposals contribute to or deliver improved access and accessibility to the water-side where relevant

“Proposals for the development of a marine activity / water sports centre at Polly Steps (or an alternative suitable location if this location proves unviable) will be supported in principle.

“Proposals for development and / or change of use which provide a viable solution for the return of gymnastics to Teignmouth will be supported in principle where they are within the settlement boundary subject to other relevant policies in the development plan.”

TEIGNMOUTH HOSPITAL SITE

The local Clinical Commissioning Group’s (CCG) plan to reorganise how medical care ultimately may result in the freeing up of the site currently occupied by Teignmouth Hospital which may be surplus to their requirements.

The site represents a potential regeneration opportunity in the town on one of the only sites which could become available during this plan’s lifetime for redevelopment with a preferred use for the site is for healthcare uses.

However if it is lost to healthcare provision first preference is for redevelopment for a mix of uses which benefit the community such as provision to meet / service health education affordable and local housing needs and to help meet other community facility needs identified in this plan.

TOWN CENTRE AND RETAIL

The Brunswick Street Local Development Order should see regeneration of an area of the town centre with proposals for regeneration on the site are in the pipeline with permission having been granted for a Premier Inn on the site and an application being considered for the new Health and Wellbeing Centre

But the plan says the challenge to Teignmouth will be to maintain and enhance its appeal to residents and visitors increase footfall and extend the length of time that there is activity in the town centre adapting positively to change and providing a policy framework which supports recovery for local retailers and traders while supporting change where it is appropriate.

It says: “It is likely that the town centre will need to adapt to change to help enable a greater mix of uses to come forward and capitalise from increasingly internet-based shopping. Where larger centres suffer from loss of larger national chains in retail and the hospitality sector while this is negative for these places this change could benefit Teignmouth through less “leakage” of shoppers from the town to other destination centres such as Exeter Newton Abbot and Torquay.

“Teignmouth town centre should also be a place where the economy is expanded in terms of the variety of offer quality and range of uses. New restaurants will receive welcome support to help extend the daytime economy provided by shops into the evening economy to attract visitors to the town from the wider Teignbridge area and beyond.”

The plan will support development in the interests of a diverse and flourishing town centre encourage and safeguard the retail function of the town centre encourage the positive use of the upper floors of shops and commercial premises and protect the Pier as a Local Heritage Asset with proposals for the development refurbishment and / or regeneration of the Pier to improve its quality and contribution to the local economy and leisure activities will be supported in principle.

TOURISM ARTS AND CULTURE

As a town with an attractive offer to visitors and tourists and a sector with potential for economic growth creative arts and cultural offer should be supported and encouraged in the town with policies seeking to encourage development of the Arts Quarter in the town and supporting growth in this sector across the wider town area.

Development proposals in this ‘Arts Quarter’ area are encouraged to focus on support for and enhancement of the arts and cultural sector the plan says while development proposals in the rest of the town centre which enhance and support the local economy and the arts and cultural offer for arts and cultural projects and uses will be supported in principle.

Development proposals for new visitor and tourism-related facilities attractions or amenities which provide additional opportunities to support the local economy and broaden and extend the visitor and tourism offer will be supported in principle and the loss of tourist facilities to other uses will only be supported where it can be satisfactorily demonstrated that the tourist facility is no longer viable or the proposed alternative use would provide equal or greater benefits for the local economy and community than the current use.

TRANSPORT

The plan confirms support for the Teign Estuary Cycle and multi-use trail being developed by Devon County Council with Teignbridge District Council and support for the trail to have a designated route (to be identified) through the town.

It also identifies improvements which need to be explored including a cycle route to avoid the congested Bitton Park junction improvements at the northern end of The Triangles and consideration of permanent daytime pedestrianisation of the Regent and Wellington Streets area identification of areas to accommodate additional parking capacity to better accommodate the needs of the town centre and catering for visitors to the town in the summer months and identification of opportunities to improve connectivity between the key “anchor points” of the town centre seafront Back Beach car parks coach drop-off point(s) Pavilions and Arts Quarter.

The junction between The Triangles Regent Street The Esplanade and Hollands Road will be reviewed with a view to providing improved and safer pedestrian access to Regent Street and possible daytime pedestrianisation of Regent Street will be explored.

THE HOLCOMBE GAP

There is limited land on the edges of the settlement built-up area boundary to develop for housing the plan says with a lack of ability to expand to the south and east due to the coast and estuary.

As a result this puts the town under pressure from development to the north and north-east towards Holcombe but to ensure that Teignmouth maintains its separate identity setting in the landscape built character and extent the designated settlement limits boundary will be reinforced to the northeast to prevent coalescence between Teignmouth and Holcombe and Dawlish and maintain a local green gap.

“Proposals for development which require planning permission will only be acceptable where they are for measures to prevent coastal erosion propose improvements to access to the countryside are for essential agricultural uses; do not compromise the visual openness and landscape character of the gap and maintain the character of the undeveloped coast.

TEIGNMOUTH PORT

The port of Teignmouth is a key employment location in the town and the second largest port facility in Devon and is a key hub for the construction agriculture and ball clay markets.

It currently handles around 460000 tonnes of cargo each year around half of which is ball clay but future port development in terms of additional warehouse construction is now limited due to the physical constraint of lack of land

The plan is supportive of changes at the port introduced through permitted development rights and which secure or enhance economic opportunities in relation to the existing uses at the port but as an important economic asset to the town it is reluctant to see land at the port redeveloped to uses which could be accommodated elsewhere and which do not need a waterside location

Development proposals which support the regeneration and improvement of facilities for fishing at The Fish Quay will be supported in principle the plan says.

WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

This consultation on the first draft plan closed on June 14 2021. The Neighbourhood Plan Steering Group will then review all comments submitted and consider changes to the plan as a result.

They then intend to publish the revised neighbourhood plan for the first legally required consultation in the autumn. This consultation widens out beyond the local community to include statutory consultees such as local authorities.

The Plan can then be submitted to Teignbridge District Council with the aim to submit the plan by early next year. The district council then runs a final consultation after which comments and the plan itself are considered by an independent examiner at a public examination.

The examiner will assess the plan using tests set by the Government. If the plan passes those tests it will be finalised and be subject to a local referendum when all eligible residents in the plan area will vote on whether to accept the plan for use in the planning system.

If a majority support the plan it becomes a legal planning document in the planning system being “made” (formally adopted) by Teignbridge District Council.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Fastest Growing Real Estate Markets in America.

The real estate market in America and even the wider world is a cornerstone of the performance of the nation and its economy. While it may not seem linked the performance of the economy often tends to reflect on the real estate market as well. While a few decades ago owning real estate was a way of life for almost anyone with a job that was even slightly above minimum wage now it is more or less a dream for even those with a well paying job. We tend to think of the homeless as people with no jobs or work ethics who laze around and try to live on benefits without actually working to be a productive member of the society. And whether or not that was true decades ago it certainly cannot be held as the gospel now. After all while it seems counterintuitive many of the homeless actually do work part time or full time jobs with more than 10% of the homeless population in some cities holding jobs. It's just that the cost of living is so high that despite jobs these people are even unable to afford rent let alone purchase real estate. Truly the American Dream seems dead in the water today.

This is mainly due to the fact that housing prices have risen significantly over the decades especially in the fastest growing real estate markets in America while salaries haven't. And whenever there's talk of increasing salaries there is significant opposition as if allowing people to earn a basic living is an offence somehow. The federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.5 an hour. It has been $7.5 since 2009 or 12 years. For 12 years the minimum wage has been the same but you can see how prices and costs have increased with respect to more or less every single thing you purchase. While the Republicans have been opposing an increase in the minimum wage and while the Democrats tabled a resolution to increase minimum wage the resolution failed with even some Democrats opposing the increase. It is part of why the poor stay poor as the rich get richer.

Moving on to the importance of the housing market did you know it was actually the housing bubble which caused/triggered the Great Recession in 2008? Basically lenders without checking the credit worthiness of potential customers started providing mortgages at extremely low interest rates which would increase exponentially in some years. Of course since they didn't check the credit worthiness of the borrowers once the interest rates increased people started defaulting on their loans which led to a high rate of foreclosures and impacted the CDO credit mortgage foreign bank and hedge fund markets leading to one of the biggest global crashes in history. Housing prices collapsed especially in the fastest growing real estate markets in America. In 2008 the United States had to set aside at least $900 billion in the form of special loans and rescue packages related to this housing bubble which brought the world's biggest superpower to its knees while also seriously impacting the global economy.

Story continues

When the pandemic hit in 2020 people were unsure about the impact on real estate. Many thought that demand would fall and this would lead to a decrease in the prices of real estate as well; however the truth was the opposite. Demand actually surged as more and more people began working remotely and could relocate easily as well which actually led to an increase in the prices of real estate in most areas across the country. Meanwhile record low mortgage rates also led to people purchasing homes they would otherwise not have considered. And the expectations are quite similar for 2021 as well; according to Forbes ""we expect sales to grow 7 percent and prices to rise another 5.7 percent on top of 2020’s already high levels. While we expect mortgage rates to tick up gradually sales and price growth will be propelled by still strong demand a recovering economy and still low mortgage rates. High buyer demand and still-lagging supply will keep prices growing but at a slower pace than 2020 as buyers contend with mortgage rate and price increases that create affordability challenges."" This shows that while the pandemic has had a significant negative impact on most industries the real estate market has managed to grow despite or perhaps because of the challenges that the pandemic has provided.

Some of the biggest real estate companies in the US include Healthpeak Properties (NYSE: PEAK) Avalon Bay Communities (NYSE: AVB) Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) and Digital Realty Trust (NYSE: DLR) and Boston Properties (NYSE: BXP). Healthpeak Properties (NYSE: PEAK) trade approximately 10% below its January 2020 levels. Avalon Bay Communities (NYSE: AVB) shares also followed a similar path and is currently trading at a 10% discount to its January 2020 levels. Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) is a different story. PSA shares were quite resilient during the March 2020 crash and actually appreciated by about 25% since the beginning of 2020. Same thing can be said about Digital Realty Trust (NYSE: DLR) shares as well. Digital Realty Trust Inc. (DLR) shares actually generated positive returns during the March 2020 crash. Out of these 5 stocks Healthpeak Properties (NYSE: PEAK) Avalon Bay Communities (NYSE: AVB) Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) and Digital Realty Trust (NYSE: DLR) and Boston Properties (NYSE: BXP) BXP is the cheapest one right now. Boston Properties (NYSE: BXP) shares need to increase close to 30% to reach its January 2020 peak.

Our favorite real estate stock was actually a different one. We recommended this real estate stock to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers in October 2020 when it was trading at $6.30. This stock returned nearly 90% since our recommendation and currently have about 20% upside potential. Another way of taking advantage of low interest rates and rising inflation is investing in the fastest growing real estate markets around the country.

While the 2008 recession led to a lot of empty homes even as prices dropped significantly the market has recovered well over the past decade and incredibly even survived the pandemic. And while the United States has seen an overall improvement in the real estate markets there are still some cities which outpace the rest. The Urban Land Institute along with PwC publishes an annual report on real estate in the US and Canada which also mentions the fastest growing real estate markets in America. So without further ado let's take a look at the markets providing the most potential for real estate starting with number 25:

And not even months of training and sacrifice during the pandemic in our notoriously cramped city has put off the West Island School alum.

“Honestly the whole process is just a lot of fun” said the Indian-born Hong Kong-raised 22-year-old adding that part of the excitement comes from not knowing what to expect.

Hong Kong’s top boxer wasn’t always so passionate about the sport

“Sometimes you don’t even know who you’re going to fight that night if it’s a tournament.

“There are a lot of intangibles involved and there’s always a different story from every fight – no two are the same. I couldn’t imagine a life without fighting.”

Last week Lulla overwhelmed former multiple Hong Kong champion Pun Ka-long. He was the only non-ethnically Hong Kong fighter on the main card with commentators rather bluntly praising “the Indian guy’s overwhelming power and swift defence”.

The downside to uncertainty

Given the disruptive closing-reopening cycle of the city’s gyms Lulla and his Versus Performance team spent most of last year grinding in makeshift training areas.

“What we’d do is hit pads and do some sparring in the park then train at my teammate Max Leali’s house” he said.

“He matted out his living room and we trained while his cats walked around us. It’s a super small space – like most flats in Hong Kong – but a lot of time was spent there.”

The HKUST student had faced Pun years earlier in the Hong Kong Secondary School Muay Thai Boxing Championships. Lulla edged the first encounter but the stakes were much higher this time.

Could this teen be the world’s first Sikh boxing champion?

“We fought when we were both 17. It was tough and we were both wearing body protectors headgear knee and elbow pads … this time was full contact totally different” said Lulla.

“As you get older you definitely mature as a fighter. You realise what you have to do to win fights with your attributes. For a long time I never really used my reach properly even though I have really long arms and legs. I was just going forward and punching.

“I’ve worked a long time on using my speed and reach.”

Covid’s effect on HK teen athletes

Finding a new home

Lulla was introduced to the martial arts world at 11. He had become less passionate about his rugby and cross-country clubs and instead started boxing at Impakt later moving to other gyms before finding a home at Versus.

“There was not a lot of training for younger fighters in Hong Kong – you kind of had to get into it later on. I decided to take it more seriously at 14 but it was really hard to get fights as a teenager.

“At Versus I could train everything I wanted to in one place and be more consistent in training MMA” said Lulla who had previously competed in regional boxing grappling and shooto (another combat sport) events.

This teen’s dream of field hockey success could become reality

Having blitzed his way through school-level championships Lulla quickly felt a huge climb in competition.

“It started getting a lot harder at the junior and Hong Kong championships. I didn’t win either. It’s been a tough road” he said.

“But my mentality has changed since then. I put a lot less pressure on myself and try not to lose the fun side of it.”

Lessons of humility and sportsmanship

The lessons of absolute humility and sportsmanship unique to combat sports can be applied to everything else in life. Traditionally Hong Kong’s Muay Thai gyms are found tucked away in rundown industrial buildings or commercial centres. But that low-key underground aspect of the nature of the sport is also part of the appeal.

“Sport in Hong Kong is generally not taken seriously. Fighting is not an elite sport here either so if you take part you’re doing it purely for the enjoyment and perhaps the hopes of one day competing overseas or against someone visiting Hong Kong” Lulla said.

The goalie following in Ronaldo’s footsteps

“Muay Thai is a lot more low-key than the Conor McGregors and Israel Adesanyas of MMA. Nobody knows who the best athletes are unless you’re in the sport or are a diehard fan. A lot of them are really skilled and very tough.

“These industrial buildings are the places that produce the champions and the toughest fighters. Those really small places that’s where you get the actual competitors.”

A realistic outlook

Lulla who was born in India then moved to Taiwan and Hong Kong for his father’s work is well aware of the equally important obligation to be successful outside the ring.

He adds thatnot everyone in his life loves how he spends his spare time.

“My mum obviously wants me to quit – she even told me today [the fight last week] that this should be the last fight and I should focus on my career. But I feel I can do both and I have enough time to do so” he added.

“My dad lets me do what I want as long as I do what I have to in other aspects in life: studying working internships part-time jobs. He wants me to be responsible more than anything. If I focused all my time on fighting he’d probably want me to quit as well.

“My dad really wanted me and my younger brother to play a lot of sports. I remember wanting to quit rugby and he said ‘No you have to compete in at least some sports’. So I ended up quitting everything for fighting. He got me into it can’t blame me!”",,,,,,

“We love Perry” said Jordan Bransetter of the Ralls County community of just under 700 but swells a bit in the summer as patrons of Mark Twain Lake visit primarily between Memorial Day and Labor Day.

The Branstetter’s have purchased Hickman’s IGA from the Hickman family and will keep the store and its name alive. The Late Bob and Jewell Hickman entered the grocery business in 1959 when they bought Richards IGA then located in the buildings along Perry’s Main Street. In 1968 they built a larger more-modern supermarket about three blocks to the east and a block north of Main.

Brothers Steve Kevin and Jim Hickman still retained ownership of the store although their other four brothers had been involved in various ways over the years. They had been looking for a buyer for a couple of years but they see the Branstetter’s as the right people to serve the community.

“It’s a good fit” Kevin Hickman said.

Scott Leake of Prestige Realty helped broker the deal. He said other offers had been coming in as of late but the Hickman’s stayed with their gut feeling to turn the keys over to the Branstetter’s.

Jordan Branstetter has been in the wholesale foods business for the last few years and Megan worked in banking. Now they will put their heart and soul into serving Perry and the surrounding communities.

The Hickman’s will be around to lend the Branstetter’s a helping hand and some advice for the first few weeks. They are taking over the store on June 28 the week before July 4 which is the store’s busiest time of the year as the campers heading to the campgrounds around Mark Twain Lake head to Hickman’s for supplies.

“They’re jumping right into the fire” Steve Hickman said.

The Hickman’s had six grocery stores around Northeast Missouri at one time. The sold four of them to Quincy’s Niemann Foods which owns the County Market grocery chain. They still owned a store in Paris until 2014. The Perry IGA was the family’s first and it is their last.

Leake grew up in Perry and was in the same class as another of the Hickman brothers Tim. He sees the IGA as a needed anchor for the community. Like many other small town in America Perry has recently added a Dollar General which has turned into the 21st Century version of the five and dime.

“Hickman’s has done so much for Perry over the years” Leake said. “Sponsoring ball teams and events means a lot to people. That doesn’t happen without stores like Hickman’s.”

Jordan Branstetter said he planned to continue that practice as it was as important as keeping the store’s original name.

“Hickman’s has always had a good name” he said.

The Branstetter’s are moving to Perry from Jackson Mo. They have family in Perry and have spent a lot of time in Perry over the years.

“We’re looking forward to being Mark Twain Tigers” Jordan said. Perry Center and New London are the three largest communities in Ralls County that feed into Mark Twain High School located in Center.

Steve and Kevin Hickman said they would remain in Perry during their retirement and look forward to being customers after decades of serving the community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlL3RoZS1zb3VuZC1vZi1zaWxlbmNlLWdlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLXRvLWNvbnZpbmNlLWF1c3RyYWxpYW5zLXRvLWVtYnJhY2UtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZXMtMjAyMTA1MjItcDU3dTdnLmh0bWzSAZ8BaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS90aGUtc291bmQtb2Ytc2lsZW5jZS1nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy10by1jb252aW5jZS1hdXN0cmFsaWFucy10by1lbWJyYWNlLWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGVzLTIwMjEwNTIyLXA1N3U3Zy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Some refuse to sit in them’: The multibillion-dollar gamble to get Australians into electric cars,"It gave the world the Corvette and the Camaro the Trans Am and Pontiac GTO; cars that idled with a rumble and then roared that were built to appeal because of their sound and fury rather than despite it.

Today General Motors is gambling that it can convince markets in Australia and America to embrace a new motoring thrill: silence.

Smith's 2019 solo show at the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art featured large-scale boldly-colored paintings of a group of people he says he feared were becoming invisible: everyday hard-working Black men.

Next month he'll be one of 35 local African-American artists to have their works included in an upcoming exhibition at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Both museums have added Smith's work into their permanent collections.

With success came the worry that some of the very people Smith raises up as his subjects might be priced out of his work. So until the end of May at a show hosted by the Natasha Ria Art Gallery he’s offering steep discounts to collectors who live in neighborhoods east of Troost Avenue in Kansas City. Paintings regularly priced at $1500 are available to this group for $250.

Harold Smith / Harold Smith Three of Smith's paintings from his celebration of Kansas City music history ""Jazz Duet"" (from left) ""Baritone Sax"" and ""New Duet"" are featured in the new show ""East of Troost"" at the Natasha Ria Art Gallery.

“I wanted to provide an opportunity for my friends east of Troost to own a piece of art” says Smith. “And I say this in all humility — to own a piece of art by an artist who's in museums at a price they can afford.”

Smith carefully selected works from the past 25 years. Most of the paintings had never been shown locally. He regards his gesture to offer paintings at prices people can afford as a small way of responding to past economic injustices.

""When you look at everything that's happened in America the result is hard on our nation our culture and society"" Smith says. ""I'm offering discounts to people east of Troost and if you live one block west then you've got to pay the full price. I really don't see that as unfair. I see it as reparations in a way.""

Harold Smith / Harold Smith Painted in bold hues are ""Howlin' Wolf"" (from left) and ""Untitled"" from the Man of Color series.

For decades Troost Avenue served as the dividing line between Black and white in Kansas City. Neighborhood covenants designed by developer J.C. Nichols in the early 20th century blocked homeownership by both Black and Jewish families. Smith says this legacy has had a lasting racial and economic impact.

“The effects of slavery and racism have had an impact on art being pursued and collected in the Black community” Smith says. “Art is one of those things that you need to have the disposable income to get and because of slavery racism and other forms of oppression there are multiple people that would love art but they don't have the disposable cash to purchase it.”

Harold Smith / Harold Smith ""The Story of Us"" is a work from Smith's series on Black love.

Smith says early on his parents discouraged him from pursuing a career in art in favor of a profession that would provide a reliable income. For 30 years he taught computer science and pursued art in his spare time. Today he’s teaching art to a new generation of students at Lincoln Middle School in Kansas City. He says it’s obvious to him that people in urban neighborhoods love art.

“You go to the Family Dollar east of Troost go look for the art supplies and it's half empty” says Smith.

He sees the same thing in the neighborhood where he lives in Kansas City Kansas. “I just went to the Dollar Tree up here and this is a Black neighborhood and I was looking for some small stretch canvases and there were just a few left.”

Smith says American institutions are beginning to acknowledge the gaps in their art collections and rushing to fill those gaps with works by artists of color.

“For a long time 90% of the art in museums was by white men” says Smith. “Museums unfortunately we like to think of them as bastions of progressivism but many are scrambling right now to overcome the fact that they were stuck with these outmoded views on race and gender.”

Julie Denesha / KCUR 89.3 Paintings Smith selected from work he's produced over the past 25 years hang at the Natasha Ria Art Gallery.

Smith says he believes those disparities would have remained entrenched were it not for the protest movement spurred by the death of George Floyd.

“Unfortunately I don't think we'd be seeing this if George Floyd had not happened” he says.

“It took what we've been talking about for eons to be shown right in their face. This is what's going on. It’s at the cost of a man's life and not just his life. I mean when these people get murdered by rogue police officers you've got to remember they leave behind children grandchildren cousins brothers and sisters who have got to deal with that trauma for the rest of their lives.”

Smith himself has been drawn into the protest movement. In 2020 he designed one of six Black Lives Matter murals painted on the streets of Kansas City. Hundreds of volunteers helped paint. When his mural was defaced by vandals shortly after it was completed he reinvented it using the black tire marks and white paint as design elements.

Smith says after a difficult year of seeing traumatic images of Black people he is ready to see something uplifting.

“I want to see something that shows black people not being terrorized” says Smith. “I want to see success you know people that got it going on and beauty definitely beauty.”

He is pretty sure other Black people are ready for the same lift — and that they might find it in his paintings at affordable prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3Jvc2UtcmV5ZXMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9OTcwNzgwMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rose Reyes Obituary (1954 - 2021) - Weimer CO - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/rose-reyes-obituary?id=9707800 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3Jvc2UtcmV5ZXMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9OTcwNzgwMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLXBvdC1zZWxsZXJzLXN0YXNoLWNhc2gtYmFua3MtbGVhdmUtdGhlbS1oaWdoLWRyeS0yMDIxLTA1LTI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Focus: U.S. pot sellers stash cash as banks leave them high and dry,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pot-sellers-stash-cash-banks-leave-them-high-dry-2021-05-24/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLXBvdC1zZWxsZXJzLXN0YXNoLWNhc2gtYmFua3MtbGVhdmUtdGhlbS1oaWdoLWRyeS0yMDIxLTA1LTI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcm9wYXJrMjQuY29tL25ld3MvbWVtb3J5LWxhbmUtY2FuZHktc3RvcmUtd2hlbi1ib3JvLXBhcmtlcnMtY291bGQtZ2V0LWJ5LXNlbGxpbmctY2lnYXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Memory Lane: Candy Store “When Boro Parkers Could Get By Selling Cigars” – Boro Park 24,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.boropark24.com/news/memory-lane-candy-store-when-boro-parkers-could-get-by-selling-cigars on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcm9wYXJrMjQuY29tL25ld3MvbWVtb3J5LWxhbmUtY2FuZHktc3RvcmUtd2hlbi1ib3JvLXBhcmtlcnMtY291bGQtZ2V0LWJ5LXNlbGxpbmctY2lnYXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

KIAWAH ISLAND S.C. — Through three rounds at the PGA Championship Phil Mickelson was hitting the ball better than he ever had been in his life. He led the field in SG: Tee-to-Green and sat atop the leaderboard. Yet at the same time Phil Mickelson was working on his swing because whether you realize it or not professional golfers are literally always working on their golf swings.

You may have noticed it watching the final round of the PGA on Sunday. Throughout the day — often while walking down the fairway in between shots — Phil would make one-handed swings without a club using only his left arm.

You can see it in motion below:

So what’s it about?

Phil’s golf swing has a few idiosyncratic moves within it it but something he’s worked on since his days alongside coach Butch Harmon has been making his golf swing wider in transition. Phil has a long golf swing — a big key to his power — but because of this his arms tend to collapse in transition and get too close to his body as Butch noted for Golf Digest right here. That leads to him getting steep and leads to a high right miss with the occasional yank left along the way.

When he’s making these rehearsals between shots that’s what he’s feeling: Like his arms are wider and more away from his body. On the range before his final round that was the single swing thought kept reiterating to his coach Andrew Getson: Wider with his left arm.

“A wider arc will allow me to have less face rotation through the ball” Mickelson said earlier in the week. “As I get a little steeper the club’s going to flip more at the bottom.”

The golf swing no matter who you are is a constant work in progress. Phil knows what he needs to do and it’s working for him so far this week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyaWMuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtbmV3cy9maXJzdC1wbGFjZS13aW5uZXJzLW9mLXRoZS1tZW51aGluLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWFubm91bmNlZC_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy53cmljLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3MvZmlyc3QtcGxhY2Utd2lubmVycy1vZi10aGUtbWVudWhpbi1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1hbm5vdW5jZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First place winners of the Menuhin Competition announced,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wric.com/entertainment-news/first-place-winners-of-the-menuhin-competition-announced/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyaWMuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtbmV3cy9maXJzdC1wbGFjZS13aW5uZXJzLW9mLXRoZS1tZW51aGluLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWFubm91bmNlZC_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy53cmljLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3MvZmlyc3QtcGxhY2Utd2lubmVycy1vZi10aGUtbWVudWhpbi1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1hbm5vdW5jZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The company has admitted to the data breach but said customers' financial information remains safe.

As per cybersecurity researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia people who have access to a portal developed by the hacker are using it to spy on customers by checking their location along with order date and time.

""Data of 18 crore orders of Domino's India have become public. Hacker created a search engine on Dark Web. If you have ever ordered @dominos_india online your data might be leaked. Data include Name Email Mobile GPS Location etc"" Rajaharia tweeted.

When contacted Jubilant FoodWorks which owns Domino's said the company had recently experienced a security incident but no financial details of customers have been breached.

""Jubilant FoodWorks experienced an information security incident recently. No data pertaining to financial information of any person was accessed and the incident has not resulted in any operational or business impact.

""As a policy we do not store financial details or credit card data of our customers thus no such information has been compromised. Our team of experts is investigating the matter and we have taken necessary actions to contain the incident"" the company spokesperson said.

Rajaharia said the hacker has created a search engine for the database which is being misused by people.

""The worst part of this alleged breach is that people are using this data to spy on people. Anybody can easily search any mobile number and can check a person's past locations with date and time. This seems like a real threat to our privacy"" Rajaharia said.

Security expert Rajshekhar Rajaria took to Twitter to report that Dominos has been subjected to a data breach yet again. He revealed that the data of 18 crore order have become public as hackers have created a search engine on Dark web. If you are a frequent Dominos buyer you are most likely to find your personal data there. The information that has been leaked includes the name email phone number and even the GPS location of users.

Talking about the data breach security expert Rajshekhar Rajaria told India Today Tech""The same hacker who hacked MobiKwik also hacked Domino's in Feb. Later he sold server access to some other reseller. It seems now the hacker failed to get ransom and they made Domino's data as a search engine on the dark web. This data includes User's Email Mobile Number Address Exact Location Order Amount. Hacker is also claiming to have Card Data. The interesting part is that people are using this data to spy on people and to find out their past location. This seems like a real threat to our privacy""

Earlier in April Alon Gal CTO of cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock had brought the incident to light. He had said that the personal information of the users was being sold by hackers for around 10 BTC. Gal had then reported that the hackers are planning to build a search portal to enable querying the data.

The data that has allegedly been compromised include 10 lakh credit card details and even addresses of people who ordered Pizza from Dominos. However Dominos India in a statement given to Gadgets 360 had denied leak of financial details of users.

“Jubilant FoodWorks experienced an information security incident recently. No data pertaining to financial information of any person was accessed and the incident has not resulted in any operational or business impact. As a policy we do not store financial details or credit card data of our customers thus no such information has been compromised.Our team of experts is investigating the matter and we have taken necessary actions to contain the incident”

Dominos is one of the most popular food service company which is owned by Jubilant Foodworks. Dominos has its outlets in over 285 cities and other countries including Bangladesh Nepal and Sri Lanka."

A CNN spokesperson said Saturday that the network has “parted ways” with Rick Santorum the former US senator and conservative commentator who was the subject of widespread condemnation for recent remarks he made about Native Americans.

In an April speech to a conservative youth group Santorum he spoke about the religious values of European settlers in the United States and said “we birthed a nation from nothing. I mean there was nothing here.”

“I mean yes we have Native Americans” he said. “But candidly that – there isn’t much Native American culture in American culture.”

When video of the speech surfaced on YouTube there were calls for Santorum to be fired from CNN. The Native American Journalists Association also spoke out against CNN as a whole.

By “effectively dismissing the millennia-long presence of Native Americans and the genocide inflicted on them as the Christian settlers transformed and expanded their colonies into the United States of America” Santorum “angered many within the Native American community and beyond” The Guardian reported.

Santorum was long a lightning rod at CNN. As a senior political commentator on the network he was an outspoken voice in support of the Trump agenda even while distancing himself from some of the former president’s behavior.

After the speech controversy he did not appear on CNN for a week. When he was booked in early May on “Cuomo Prime Time” anchor Chris Cuomo confronted him on the matter and Santorum acknowledged that his comments were inaccurate. He said that he misspoke.

“I was talking about and I misspoke in this respect I was talking about the founding and the principles embodied in the founding” he said.

Santorum added “I would never and you know people have said ‘Oh I’m trying to dismiss what we did to the Native Americans.’ Far from it! The way we treated Native Americans was horrific. It goes against every bone and everything I’ve ever fought for as a leader in the Congress.”

However he did not apologize for his remarks in the speech.

HuffPost which first reported the news said Santorum’s contract was “terminated” and quoted a source who said the “Cuomo Prime Time” interview was not well-received inside the network.

“Leadership wasn’t particularly satisfied with that appearance. None of the anchors wanted to book him” the source described as a senior executive told HuffPost. “So he was essentially benched anyway.”

Santorum did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Santorum is not the first CNN commentator to exit amid controversy. Memorable past cases have involved Jeffrey Lord and Paris Dennard.

In all CNN has scores of paid contributors who bring point of view and insight in many different fields.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9tZWRpYS9jaGljYWdvLW1heW9yLWxpZ2h0Zm9vdC1qb3VybmFsaXN0cy1yYWNlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzA1LzIzL21lZGlhL2NoaWNhZ28tbWF5b3ItbGlnaHRmb290LWpvdXJuYWxpc3RzLXJhY2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latino journalist explains why he turned down interview with Chicago's mayor,"CNN —

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot sparked a backlash last week after limiting interviews to journalists of color on the two-year anniversary of her inauguration a decision she intended to put a spotlight on the lack of diversity in media.

But many journalists politicians and commentators seized on the moment as a misguided stunt.

Gregory Pratt a Chicago Tribune reporter who covers city hall told CNN Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter on Sunday that the paper declined the interview on ethical grounds.

“Our paper decided to turn it down because we didn’t feel it was appropriate for a government official to tell us who we can send to do an interview” Pratt said on “Reliable Sources.”

Pratt who is Latino said he was offered an interview with the mayor but wasn’t informed about Lightfoot’s exclusion of reporters based on race.

“They didn’t tell me that was a condition” he said. “I didn’t learn about it until it sort of started percolating with the other reporters who were denied.”

Pratt said the mayor is “absolutely correct that there are diversity problems in the media” but ultimately her decision sparked “very polarizing reactions.”

In a two-page letter sent to local media outlets and dated May 19 Lightfoot said she has done everything she can to fight for diversity and inclusion during her adult life. Being the city’s mayor makes her “uniquely situated” to shine a spotlight on the issue she said.

Since her election the country has faced an “historic reckoning around systemic racism” and it does not appear that media outlets in Chicago “have caught on and truly have not embraced this moment” Lightfoot said in the letter shared with CNN.

The National Association of Black Journalists said it did not support the mayor’s tactic but acknowledged that her comments shine a “needed spotlight on the call for a greater commitment to diversity equity and inclusion across the media industry.”

The National Association of Hispanic Journalists said the group doesn’t condone restricting press access based on a journalist’s race or ethnicity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTYyNTEwNNIBJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvYW1wLzE2MjUxMDQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HERITAGE: THE SEEDS THE OJHAS SOWED,"In the early 1970s while passing daily through Business Recorder Road in Karachi I never reflected on its former name Deepchand Ojha Road or on its significance. Years later as nostalgia struck I started exploring it. The name should have struck a chord. It carried the name of the benefactor of the Ojha Sanatorium of course!

Since 2003 the Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases has been the third constituent institute of Dow University of Health Sciences. Yet the journey commenced decades ago and the foundation stone for the original sanatorium was laid some 82 years ago. The institute went through tumultuous times of war political turmoil during Partition and yet it not only survived but thrived.

The Ojha Family

So who was Ojha? The quest led me to his descendent Kamal Ojha a gynaecologist in London. I also found information in the book Great Personalities of Pushkarna Brahmin.

The Ojhas settled in Thatta over a couple of centuries ago coming from Jaisalmer in present-day India. They were known for their Ayurvedic skills. Ranchordas was a famous Ayurvedic physician who had four sons: Tejbhandas and Swamidas remained in Thatta whereas Lalchand and Thakurdas lived in Karachi. Tejbhandas had a lucrative business of Ayurvedic products and fathered six sons. Two died in childhood. Deepchand was the eldest and he and his younger brother Aasanmal were sent to Karachi for education. Aasanmal studied law in Bombay but returned to practise it in Karachi. Their younger brother Sukhramdas practiced Ayurvedic medicine; having been educated abroad he established a flourishing practice in Karachi.

Deepchand started as chief clerk at the Karachi municipality on completion of his studies from D.J. Science College before being appointed chief clerk in the Karachi district court. While working he passed the bar in 1897 and became a subordinate judge in Sukkur. However later in 1902 he returned to Karachi as the Registrar for Saddar Court. He then practised as an independent lawyer.

The Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases in Karachi which now offers state-of-the-art healthcare and postgraduate training programmes in pulmonology and tuberculosis began life as one family’s philanthropic venture

Deepchand became a councillor of the Karachi Municipality in 1908 and later chairman of its school board. He rose to be the vice president of the municipality. In the early 1920s he also served as a member of the Bombay Legislative Council. He established the Deepchand T. Ojha School in Lyari around 1918-1920.

Deepchand Ojha

He married Ramabhai but none of her six pregnancies bore a child. Following her death and persuaded by friends and family he tied the knot with Choti Bai. They had a son named Kishandas. Unfortunately the son died in 1925 presumably of tuberculosis.

When Deepchand himself died in 1938 at the age of 66 he left part of his property in a trust under Sukhramdas to serve patients with tuberculosis. To that fund of 50000 rupees Sukhramdas further added 5000 rupees. To materialise the project the Ayurvedic Tuberculosis Relief Association was formed with Mayor Jamshed Nusserwanji Mehta as chairman Seth Manoobhai Doongursee as secretary and a board of trustees.

Expansion of the sanatorium

The government donated a plot of 127 acres in Deh Safooran for the tuberculosis centre. Dr Frimodt-Møller the medical superintendent of the United Mission Tuberculosis Sanatorium of Madanapalle Andhra Pradesh advised on its design. Thus on June 16 1939 then provincial minister Nihal Das Vazirani laid the foundation of the hospital named after Deepchand T. Ojha. The construction was delegated to Velji Herka Patel & Sons.

An infirmary block of 20 rooms an administrative block of three rooms two houses — one for a doctor and another for a vaid (practitioner of Ayurvedic medicine) — four quarters for staff (donated by Dr Kaikhushro Spencer’s family) and a 30-room block for servants were erected. The complex was designed as 64 small cottages for the patients 80 feet apart — some double roomed.

Each unit had a bedroom kitchen latrine and a veranda. All those cottages were raised through donations each costing around 1400 rupees. The donors put plaques in each veranda for example “In sacred memory of Khan Bahadur Dadabhai Munsiff died on 19th February 1910 — donated by his wife Goolbano D Munsiff”; “In the loving memory of Bachubai Nadirshaw Eduljee Dinshaw erected by her brothers who miss her loss”; and “Built by Seth Jeewanjee Karimjee Mursiwalla in memory of his wife Bai Amtulbai.”

Seth Doongursee Joshi donated the recreation hall. Sir David Sassoon contributed the electric generator which came from Poona and constructed the power house. Sukhramdas built his bungalow at his own expense for periodic stays in the sanatorium. He served as the honorary manager. The project was formally opened by the Viceroy and Governor General of India Lord Linlithgow on January 8 1942. Later a musafirkhana [waiting room] and a chapel were added.

During World War II the army requisitioned this facility to accommodate an American Army base prisoners of war and Polish refugees. It was released back as Deepchand T. Ojha TB Sanatorium in 1946.

Patients were given a choice of treatment by a doctor or an Ayurved. The two dispensaries functioned separately. Those patients who could afford treatment donated to the sanatorium. The poor were treated for free. Their families in the cottage were provided facilities for cooking. Those who chose not to cook were offered the option of a local caterer who would supply them meals at their own expense.

Soon Partition saw the Hindu staff migrating to India. Sukhramdas left for Bombay in 1948. As a consequence the sanatorium closed and the Ayurvedic Tuberculosis Relief Association became defunct. Only three of its trustees remained: Jamshed Nusserwanjee Mehta Sardar Gabol and Mrs Shahani. It was handed over to the Government of Pakistan in 1948 but it remained non-functional. Through the efforts of Mehta the sanatorium was restored in December 1949.

Plaque commemorating the Ojha Sanatorium’s opening ceremony 1942

The sanatorium resumed under the aegis of the TB section of Jinnah Central Hospital. The complex bore a deserted look and had no meaningful equipment left. It was revamped with a re-allocation of budget and staff and Dr Iqbal Yad was appointed the first medical officer incharge.

In February 1950 a group of 20 male patients were transferred here from Jinnah Central Hospital. Another batch of 20 female patients followed in March. It became the TB Annexe of Jinnah Central Hospital. Incidentally as the sanatorium was being re-established Sukhramdas died in Bombay in 1950.

The first effective antibiotic Streptomycin was discovered in the 1940s revolutionising the management of tuberculosis. This was the first hospital in Karachi to offer Streptomycin injections.

The sanatorium operated under the leadership of Dr A.K. Shariff Prof M.A.H. Siddiqui Dr S.A. Hussain and Dr Yad but was under the administration of the Superintendent of the Jinnah Central Hospital until it became an independent hospital in December 1957. In this period its bed capacity increased to 100 radiology equipment was updated facilities for surgery enhanced and staff quarters added.

As it became an independent institute Dr Shariff was appointed as its first director. With the advent of new effective anti-tuberculosis therapy sanatoriums around the world were being transformed. In 1958 it was obvious that the Ojha Sanatorium needed a major overhaul to modernise the facilities in all spheres. A scheme of expansion and modernisation costing 47 lakhs was approved in 1961. Around that time Dr Yad returned as its director with the longest tenure serving until his death on July 10 1978. He oversaw the sanatorium through major milestones of development and led its path to a modernised institute. The work commenced by April 1962. The foundation stone for the hospital’s new main block was laid by the then Health Minister Abdul Kadir Sanjrani in November 1962. The expansion work was completed in 1967 with the addition of five blocks and was formally reopened in September 1967 by Begum Zahida Khaliquz Zaman the health minister.

It now had a main hospital block modern surgical theatre fully equipped central kitchen facilities an electricity sub-station natural gas installed properly laid paths and roads automatic laundry and sterilisation incinerator a mosque and a hostel for nurses and staff quarters. The bed capacity increased to 350 with the additional five wards radiology and laboratory facilities were upgraded and the dispensary uplifted. The city established public transport links and the hospital acquired its own transportation. It now emerged as one of the largest full-fledged tuberculosis hospitals of the country. The institution now offered teaching and training as well.

A teaching institute and a modern facility for TB patients

In 1970 the Ojha Sanatorium was handed over to the health department of the Government of Sindh.

The hospital was upgraded from the status of a sanatorium to the Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases in 1973. The chest clinic now where the present Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) is located was a part of the Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases and headed by Dr Ghazala Ansari.

In 1994 the institute was recognised by the College of Physicians & Surgeons of Pakistan (FCPS). It kept abreast with tuberculosis technology and research and in 2010 was selected as a centre for multidrug-resistant TB management. Its laboratory is designated as a Provincial Reference Laboratory for TB. Established in collaboration with the World Health Organization it provides free-of-cost healthcare. In recent years an intensive care unit has been added. It offers approved postgraduate training programs for FCPS (Pulmonology) Diploma in Tuberculosis and Chest Diseases Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Surgery besides paramedical training.

The sanatorium started by the Ojhas over 80 years ago has journeyed to becoming a full-fledged university.

One experienced midwife who didn’t want to be named because she feared losing her job said the overload long shifts and staff burnout was a statewide problem. “That happens quite a bit: the hospital acknowledges you are fatigued and not at your best so anybody who works from the PM to night duty gets taken out of high acuity and put into a quiet ward” the midwife said. “It’s like saying ‘we know you’re going to be bad at your job tonight because you’re exhausted so we’re going to put you somewhere where you’re not going to make a mistake’.” She said that one day this month at the Royal Women’s Hospital “there were two women who had given birth in the emergency ward and three more in labour” and no available birth centre beds.

The AMA is also concerned that neonatal and paediatric intensive care units have been pushed to capacity due to the increase in births and it says extra beds and specialist nurses are urgently needed. Loading The AMA’s Victorian president Julian Rait said the lockdown appeared to be among a range of factors that had led to the surge in pregnancies. “Obviously [the lockdown] pushed some couples apart and it’s also brought many together and we’ve got a baby boom” he said. “The other theory is that people have decided to start their families now maybe because they can’t travel.

“At the same time the costs of private health insurance and private obstetric care is an issue and many people are now choosing to go public for their deliveries. That means our public obstetric services are being hammered like never before.” The Victorian government confirmed the pandemic had placed increased demand on some maternity services. It did not provide statistics on recent births at maternity services but individual hospitals are reporting increases including at Joan Kirner Women’s and Children’s at Sunshine Hospital where there has been more than a 5 per cent jump in the first four months of the year compared to the year before. The Health Department and Victoria’s healthcare safety watchdog Safer Care Victoria has been meeting with public maternity service providers including the Royal Women’s Hospital to discuss strategies to deal with the changing demand. “On some occasions care may be provided differently than planned. Any changes are to manage patient safety and only occur with strict clinical oversight” a government spokesman said. Associate Professor Rait said while this week’s Victorian budget had provided $3.7 billion to help address the state’s overloaded health system more would probably be required given the recent service demands.

Greens member for Melbourne Ellen Sandell whose electorate includes the Royal Women’s Hospital raised questions with Health Minister Martin Foley in Parliament early this month about “a concerning increase in the rate of caesareans … as well as other poor birth outcomes for women” at Victorian public hospitals. She said a constituent had her baby on the floor of a birth suite where she had been rushed at the last minute due to a lack of available birth centre beds. “When I went into labour I was kept in the emergency room because there were no beds available in the birth suite ... I was then raced into the birth suite when I told them I needed to push and my daughter was born 13 minutes later (on the floor because I didn’t make it to the bed in time)” the woman who does not wish to be identified wrote to Ms Sandell. Nurses union state secretary Ms Fitzpatrick warned of a disaster “happening right before our eyes”. Ms Dicarlo who had her baby at the Royal Women’s Hospital earlier this year brought a private midwife to her birth to ensure continuity of care and said the birth and surgical care for her unplanned caesarean was excellent but she was traumatised by her poor experience post-birth.

She had to wait two hours after her healthy son was born to hold him and experienced long delays when in pain and needing medication. “They were extremely understaffed and really stretched it was really difficult to get help. You would be lying there and really need pain relief and you can’t move because you just had surgery the baby’s screaming and you press the button and it takes someone over an hour to come” she said. The director of maternity services at the Royal Women’s Hospital Jenny Ryan said the hospital would always listen to concerns and work with patients to take appropriate action. “Maternity services across Victoria have had a very busy start to 2021 and we are proud of our hard-working staff who continue to provide high-quality care to Victorians” she said.

The test drive was organised ahead of COP 26 which takes place in Glasgow later this year as The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are visiting innovative projects in Scotland which aim to positively turn the dial on the climate emergency during Lord High Commissioner’s Week.

As well as understanding more about the series’ electrification environment and equality background the visit provided an opportunity for Prince William to take a look at Extreme E’s hydrogen fuel cell - created in collaboration with British-based AFC Energy – which charges its electric race fleet using zero-emission energy.

Prince William was hosted by Extreme E CEO and Founder Alejandro Agag a driving force behind the electric motorsport revolution Adam Bond CEO of AFC Energy along with members of two of Extreme E’s British teams; George Imafidon a Junior Engineer on Lewis Hamilton’s X44 team; and driver Catie Munnings who races for the Andretti United team who was on hand to show the Prince how to get the best out of the series’ electric race vehicle.

Alejandro Agag Founder and CEO of Extreme E said: “It was a great honour for Extreme E to host Prince William at Knockhill today. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to show him the ways in which we are working towards the same shared goals around a lower carbon future for our planet.

“I think he really enjoyed his experience behind the wheel of the ODYSSEY 21 under the expert instruction of Catie. Perhaps a guest racing appearance in Extreme E beckons in the future!”

Adam Bond CEO of AFC Energy said: “It was a true pleasure today to host one of the world’s leading climate ambassadors His Royal Highness Prince William to demonstrate first-hand the role Hydrogen and Fuel Cells can play in supporting the world’s Net Zero aspirations.

“The environment is a key pillar for our sustainable future and to this end it was a privilege to showcase how AFC Energy and Extreme E are partnering to deliver not only a world first off-grid charging solution for the inaugural all-electric motorsport series but more importantly how this one series is quickly defining a new standard for all industry in its transition away from diesel generation.”

The AFC Energy fuel cell innovation is just one of a selection of technologies utilised by the sport for purpose series with the aim to run the most sustainable motorsport championship possible and also fits with the spirit of The Earthshot Prize a global environmental prize founded by Prince William in October 2020 which aims to discover and scale the best solutions to help repair our planet over the next 10 years.

Inspired by President Kennedy’s ‘moonshot’ The Earthshot Prize is based on five simple but ambitious ‘Earthshot’ goals - protect and restore nature clean our air revive our oceans build a waste-free world and fix our climate - which if achieved by 2030 will repair the planet before irreversible damage occurs and improve life for us all. Starting this autumn and every year until 2030 The Earthshot Prize will be awarded to five winners one per Earthshot whose innovative solutions make the most progress towards these goals to repair the planet help protect those most vulnerable to the changing climate and create a healthier cleaner and better life for us all.

The two organisations are also working with Count Us In to inspire people to make pledges to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint such as walking and cycling more eating more plant-based foods and even purchasing an electric vehicle. The Extreme E Count Us In Challenge culminates at the end of the year with the Sustainability Award which is given to the team that has the most fans taking steps to lead a less carbon intensive lifestyle.

Alongside AFC Energy Extreme E is working with a host of sustainable businesses including Zenobe that has provided a second-life battery to help power Extreme E’s team garages and broadcast infrastructure and Polymateria that is providing Extreme E with the world’s first plastic with time-controlled open-air biodegradability that will return quickly and safely to nature if it ends up in the natural environment while also allowing for recycling to happen.

Not only does the series have big climate crisis awareness ambitions it is also the first motorsport series in the world to have a fully gender equal sporting format with it built into the rules that each team must field a male and a female driver. Both drivers compete a lap each in every race as a driver switch is incorporated at the end of the first lap.

Catie Munnings who competes for the Andretti United Extreme E team which finished on the podium in last month’s Desert X Prix said: “Today will certainly be one of those days that I won’t forget in a hurry! It was an absolute honour to meet The Duke of Cambridge and to teach him about the ODYSSEY 21 and some of the key attributes of these incredible machines. Prince William grasped the basic skills quickly and seemed very at ease with driving electric vehicles maybe my Andretti United team-mate Timmy [Hansen] should be feeling a little threatened!

“Sustainability is a central messaging pillar of Extreme E and with the Earthshot Prize it’s fantastic to see that we are all working towards a common goal of a cleaner more environmentally-friendly future.”



George Imafidon is a Junior Engineer for Sir Lewis Hamilton’s Extreme E team X44 and a Commissioner on The Hamilton Commission a standalone research project set up last year by the Seven Time Formula One World Champion in partnership with the Royal Academy of Engineering that is working to improve the representation of Black people in UK motorsport.



George Imafidon said: “It was an honour to be at the event today and to meet His Royal Highness Prince William.

Peter David Czaplicki 52 was convicted in September 2000 in Suffolk County N.Y. of first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy. The convictions required him to register as a sex offender and he has completed 48 required registration forms with the most recent being on April 22.

On that date Czaplicki reported to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office’s Sexual Offender Predator Unit and removed a gray 2008 Pontiac G6 from his registration. The vehicle which was sold in January belonged to Czaplicki’s live-in girlfriend a sheriff’s office report states.

Czaplicki was informed that all vehicle changes were required to be reported within 48 hours which he failed to do. He was told that any future violations of his requirements could result in his arrest the report says.

Czaplicki told a registration specialist that he was unemployed and did occasional side jobs. He said he didn’t have a professional license and signed Florida Department of Law Enforcement sexual offender registration forms saying he understood the requirements placed on him the report says adding that Czaplicki’s last reported employment was at Gator’s Dockside from March 3 2020 to Jan. 11 of this year.

On Tuesday a sheriff’s deputy responded to Czaplicki’s residence to conduct an address verification. He observed a lawn trailer in the yard and noted that Czaplicki was employed at Clean Cut Lawn Service. A computer search revealed that Czaplicki had applied for a business license on July 20 2020 at 5940 S.E. 140th Place in Summerfield with a company name of Clean Cut Lawn Service the report says adding that the license expires on Dec. 31 2025.

A corporal with the sheriff’s office’s Major Crimes Department spoke with Czaplicki by phone and asked him about his current employment status. He said he was the owner of Clean Cut Lawn Service “because no one wants to hire him due to his charges.” He confirmed that he had a business license and said he didn’t know he was required to report it to the sheriff’s office. He was told to report to the Sexual Offender Unit on Thursday with a copy of his professional license the report says.

Czaplicki reported in on Thursday and after being read his rights he confirmed that he had acquired a business license in July 2020 and started his own company which he said he didn’t expect to “take off so quickly.” He was reminded that he had signed multiple registration forms since he started his employment and received his professional license and had signed an FDLE registration form claiming that he was unemployed and didn’t have a professional license. He was then placed under arrest and transported to the Marion County Jail.

Czaplicki who originally is from Hempstead N.Y. was charged with sex offender violations of failing to register changes to employment and knowingly providing false registration information by act or omission. He was being held on no bond and his next court date hasn’t yet been set jail records show.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaHVyY2hvZnNjb3RsYW5kLm9yZy51ay9uZXdzLWFuZC1ldmVudHMvbmV3cy9hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjEvcHJpbmNlLXdpbGxpYW0tc2F5cy1jaHVyY2gtZm91bmQtbmV3LWxpZmUtcHVycG9zZS1hbmQtZW5lcmd5LWR1cmluZy1wYW5kZW1pY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince William says Church found new life purpose and energy during pandemic,"Prince William says Church found new life purpose and energy during pandemic

Published on 22 May 2021 5 minutes read

Prince William has said that Scotland will ""forever run deep"" in his heart and praised the Church for its response to the pandemic.

His Royal Highness told the General Assembly that the country is incredibly important to him and the source of some of his happiest and saddest memories.

He said his childhood was full of carefree holidays swimming in lochs he met his wife at the University of St Andrews and spent time training as a pilot in Inverness.

Prince William addresses the General Assembly

The Duke of Cambridge who is serving as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly Her Majesty the Queen's personal representative was staying at Balmoral Castle on Royal Deeside when his mother died.

Diana the Princess of Wales died of injuries she sustained in a car crash in Paris France on the 31st of August 1997.

Addressing commissioners from the Assembly Hall in Edinburgh Prince William who was 15 at the time said: ""I was in Balmoral when I was told that my mother had died.

""Still in shock I found sanctuary in the service at Crathie Kirk that very morning.

""And in the dark days of grief that followed I found comfort and solace in the Scottish outdoors.

""As a result the connection I feel to Scotland will forever run deep.""

Great honour

Prince William who is known as the Earl of Strathearn in Scotland said alongside that painful memory is one of great joy.

""It was here in Scotland – twenty years ago this September – that I first met Catherine"" he added.

""Needless to say the town where you meet your future wife holds a very special place in your heart.""

Prince William said their children George Charlotte and Louis already know how dear Scotland is to them and are starting to build their own happy memories.

The Duke of Cambridge said being asked by his grandmother to be her personal representative at the General Assembly was a ""great honour and a humbling opportunity"".

He said that Her Majesty the Queen asked him to reassure commissioners of her pledge to preserve and uphold the rights and privileges of the Church of Scotland.

""One day it will be my responsibility to swear my own oath to maintain and preserve the security and independence of the Church of Scotland"" he added.

""This convention signifies the mutual respect tolerance and understanding that has characterised the relationship between the Sovereign and the Kirk over the past three hundred years.""

Lord Wallace Prince William and First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon MSP

Prince William said the Church had been an ""essential refuge"" for people across Scotland over the last 12 months due to the ""harrowing"" and ""incredibly challenging"" COVID-19 pandemic.

He said it ""truly came alive"" to care for the most vulnerable in society.

New purpose new life

Recalling the first lockdown Prince William said ""Shutting Kirk doors during Lent last March must have been heart-breaking.

""The natural way that ministers bring comfort and guidance to those in need was impossible.

""Yet local congregations led by creative and determined ministers and members found their own ways to continue worship and provide pastoral support online or by phone.

""You have re-imagined yourselves helping to reach out to those who need it the most.

""Lightening the load of isolation and ensuring that people are safe and not forgotten.

""You have looked beyond the boundaries of your congregations to become agents of support and comfort to your wider community.

""You have drawn new members to online services from around the globe.

""You have embraced change and found new life purpose and energy through your willingness to adapt.""

Prince William said he imagined some people have been reminded afresh of the ""true power"" of the Church.

He suggested that its future lies not simply in Kirk buildings but in the values of peace healing and ‘love for thy neighbour'.

As part of General Assembly week Prince William and his wife are visiting projects across Scotland to learn how people and organisations are tackling problems such as mental health homelessness and addiction.

He said: ""As we try to emerge from a long period of uncertainty and turmoil I am grateful for the chance I will get this week to really listen with humility and compassion to many people in Scotland from all walks of life from different traditions and from all faiths and none.

""It has been suggested that I take Proverbs 19:20 as my guide – ‘Listen to advice and accept instruction that you may gain wisdom in the future'.

Lord Wallace is the second elder in modern times to serve as the Moderator of the General Assembly

Prince William congratulated Lord Wallace on his appointment as Moderator of the General Assembly and wished him all the very best for a rewarding year ahead.

He said the elder from Orkney was no stranger to public life having served the governments and parliaments at Holyrood and Westminster with great distinction for nearly 40 years.

""Your appointment as Moderator extends that service this time to the spiritual mission of the Church of Scotland"" added Prince William.

""The General Assembly and the Church of Scotland more broadly will benefit hugely from your experience wisdom and above all - your faith - during the discussions this week and in the months ahead.""

Tribute to Prince Philip

Lord Wallace said it is a source of ""real pleasure"" to many people that Her Majesty chose her grandson to represent her at the General Assembly.

Addressing Prince William the Moderator said: ""We meet only a few weeks after the death of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh.

""I should wish to reassure Your Grace that the Church continues to uphold the Queen and her family in prayer at this time and that you may find comfort in the faith to which Her Majesty bears such steadfast witness.

""And we should wish to give thanks for His Royal Highness' decades of dedicated service to the Queen and our country.""

Prince Philip who died on the 9th of April aged 99 addressed the General Assembly in 1969.

Lord Wallace said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have done so much to raise awareness of mental health and to support mental health charities.

""That is an issue the General Assembly will surely want to address in the coming week"" added the Moderator.

During your visits to different parts of Scotland people will tell it to you as it is.

""And I am confident that amidst the challenges you will find many examples of compassionate and pioneering work including the work undertaken by the Kirk's CrossReach teams.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZ3Vlcm5zZXlwcmVzcy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvZHVrZS1vZi1jYW1icmlkZ2UtdGFrZXMtdG8tdGhlLXRyYWNrLWluLXBpb25lZXJpbmctZWxlY3RyaWMtcmFjZS1jYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke of Cambridge takes to the track in pioneering electric race car,"The Duke of Cambridge impressed professional race drivers as he drove a pioneering electric SUV round a track in Scotland with only a few bumps and scrapes.

William visited the Knockhill Racing Circuit in Fife to view motorsport company Extreme E’s hydrogen fuel cell for charging cars using zero-emission energy.

The duke spoke to the developers of the technology asking them not to go into too much detail joking it would go over his head.

He spoke to Alejandro Agag founder and chief executive of Extreme E and George Imafidon a junior engineer on Lewis Hamilton’s X44 team.

He was shown the electric race SUV by driver Catie Munnings who competes for the Andretti United Extreme E team before driving it on Knockhill’s 4×4 track.

After being told the car’s horsepower he said: “Put some wings on it it would take off.”

The duke drove the car – equipped with a “Prince William” decal with a British flag – around the muddy twists and turns of the circuit.

Despite clipping a chicane on one turn William emerged to praise from staff and drivers saying the experience was “awesome” and he was “going to apply for a job” with the company.

“That’s my kind of racing … a track’s a track tarmac but this is just that bit of slideyness that grit and it’s heavy you’ve really got to think about what the weight distribution is like.”

Ms Munnings was full of praise for the duke.

“It was an honour to meet Prince William and to drive alongside him. It just felt like having one of your mates in the car. He’s so relatable and really relaxed and a really good driver as well.

She added: “I’ve been a rally instructor for years so I was really surprised by his car control and he turned up the power as well to almost the max of what we can do in the Extreme E car as well.

She said he was not nervous at all in the car.

She added: “He was lovely sharing stories in the car about the motorbikes he rides and how he reins it in now that he’s a dad and it was really cool to get to know him.”",,,

In a past life the grounds of The Home Course in DuPont Wash. housed a plant that produced dynamite and black powder. The unique track — the sixth hole is shown here — will host stroke play for this month’s U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship. Photo courtesy of The Home Course

The Home Course in DuPont Wash. was once the site of a plant that produced and manufactured commercial explosives. The USGA seems to think the public golf course that now sits on the land is dynamite.

The sixth U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship is May 22-26 and The Home Course will be a part of the action serving as a co-host to stroke play rounds with Chambers Bay in University Place Wash. The Home Course designed by the late architect Mike Asmundson served as a U.S. Open local qualifying site for the championship held in 2015 at Chambers Bay. Before that The Home Course was the companion course for the U.S. Amateur in 2010 at Chambers Bay.

Championships are often reserved for older more famous facilities yet the 14-year-old Home Course is establishing an impressive résumé. It’s cooperatively owned by the Pacific Northwest Golf Association and Washington Golf. Both organizations plan to eventually house their offices on the scenic layout between Puget Sound Mount Rainier and the Olympic Mountains. GCSAA Class A superintendent Dennis Roque a 17-year GCSAA member oversees The Home Course.

“Dennis is going to do a great job” says Cory Isom USGA Green Section West Region agronomist. “Someone like him makes it easier for us to achieve what championship directors are looking for.”

Unless you’re from the area you may not know the entire fascinating story that literally lies beneath in and around The Home Course. The land was originally settled by multiple Native American tribes including the Nisqually Tribe. Europeans came next. The Hudson’s Bay Co. operated a trading post there. Eventually E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (now known as DuPont Co.) acquired the property in 1906 and its explosives plant was instrumental in western expansion. Black powder and dynamite were used to help clear the land for farming and railroads. Some rail remains on the golf course today.

The land’s transformation from explosives facility to golf course began to take shape in the late 1970s when Weyerhaeuser Co. took over the location with the intention of industrializing it. Weyerhaeuser DuPont and the Washington State Department of Ecology collaborated to launch a site cleanup with cooperation from the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historical Preservation the Nisqually Tribe the city of DuPont the DuPont Historical Society and other stakeholders.

Golf course construction was part of the meticulous thorough environmental remediation process. More than 50000 cubic yards of contaminated soil — the majority of it the result of explosive compounds — was removed from the site and sent to a hazardous waste landfill.



The contents of these barrels that were removed from the site before the golf course was constructed remains a mystery. “No one really knows what was in those barrels — at least not us anyway” says Home Course superintendent Dennis Roque. “It could not have been good.” Photo courtesy of Dennis Roque

“Before the cleanup it was a pretty gnarly joint” says Home Course equipment manager Joey Bass a seven-year GCSAA member who has been familiar with the property since before the golf course was initially seeded. Bass recalls workers wearing Tyvek protective suits to safeguard from hazardous materials.

A photo gallery on the state’s Department of Ecology website has a hole-by-hole breakdown of what was addressed during the massive cleanup effort. Here’s a sampling:

No. 4 has a natural topographical depression which was used as a disposal area for empty drums. The back tee is bordered by the foundation from a former manufacturing building.

No. 7 is the spot to be on a sunny day as it offers quite a view of Mount Rainier. It’s also where the site cleanup identified lead and other materials of concern.

No. 16 is an ideal place to take in Puget Sound. It’s also where a former explosives storage area was incorporated into the golf course design resulting in a distinct mound.

The history makes for some unconventional maintenance challenges for Roque and his crew. “Essentially it (the course) was capped and grown on gravel” he says. “That makes trying to grow grass pretty difficult.” The Home Course has T-1 bentgrass greens; the rest of the layout is a ryegrass/Poa annua mix. Roque says his biggest issue with the grass is that everything leaches and holding nutrients is difficult. His method of offsetting the gravel in order to secure soil nutrients is by sanding tees and fairways (80/20 sand/organic matter). “Pretty extensive sanding twice a year” Roque says of the work done on tees fairways and surrounds. “We bring in close to 270 tons of sand.”

Roque can’t easily aerify tees and fairways despite years of sanding. He has tried solid tines and tines bent 90 degrees. “It’s not too tough trying to solid-tine (tees) but pulling up a core is tough. You can bring up a lot of gravel” he says. “The most I can do is slice the fairways with a Bannerman using an 8-inch blade. You’re able to slice the fairways but aerifying is not in the cards yet.”



This part of an old storage bunker — which were referred to as “concrete magazines” — is located to the left of the ninth hole rough. Superintendent Dennis Roque says the feature comes into play quite often.



Railroad tracks to the left of the No. 10 tee. “This railway took supplies or workers to all parts of the property” says Home Course superintendent Dennis Roque. “This short piece of track is all that remains of the railway. You have to pass through it to get to the white and blue tees on No. 10.” Photos courtesy of Dennis Roque

Five years ago the Washington State Department of Ecology announced The Home Course had been removed from the Hazardous Sites List formally recognizing an effective cleanup.

Oh traces of the bygone era remain. Bricks that were removed from a power station on the land have been installed between some tee boxes. If a golfer pipes a drive on the 15th tee to the right side of the large fairway mound that has remnants from the explosives manufacturing area buried beneath it the result can be a hefty bounce that advances the ball even farther.

The Home Course has certainly come a long way. “They’ve taken it and made it better” says former DuPont Mayor Michael Grayum. “Dennis and his staff are top-notch. Having the USGA come is icing on the cake.”

Allyson Brooks Ph.D. director/officer for the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historical Preservation says “It’s an interesting place for a golf course. It has such a wealth of history.”

Roque was introduced to the industry as a caretaker of research plots at Washington State University. Later he arrived as an assistant at The Home Course in 2008 where he was mentored by then-superintendent Kelly Donaldson. In 2014 Roque became superintendent. He tells a story about a former maintenance employee who swears he saw a ghost on the first hole several years ago. Initially Roque was skeptical. Now? Not so much. “Since I got here 13 years ago and began to delve into the history I’m not completely surprised” he says.

Although he hasn’t seen a ghost himself Roque does sense the presence of something truly special with the USGA championship happening soon. And he’s having an absolute blast. “Coming off a crazy year this is huge” Roque says. “The grind is hard but it’s worth it. It definitely has become quite the place here.”

As Toulouse hoisted their record fifth European trophy into the evening sky it was momentarily possible to overlook all the wintry 28-0 Covid walkovers and logistical travel nightmares that had threatened to leave the organisers with nowhere to go.

From a sporting narrative perspective too it was heartwarming to see France’s new shimmering star Antoine Dupont share a joyful trophy lift with the 38-year-old former All Black Jerome Kaino twice a World Cup winner and now a European champion as well. Kaino’s career ends this summer and his medal collection now ranks up with the very best.

Having been crowned – unlikely as it may sound – as the first Frenchman to be voted European player of the year Dupont may be one of the few modernists capable of scaling similar heights. As Toulouse refocus on their pursuit of another Top 14 title however there can be no avoiding the blunt fact that Saturday’s staccato final threw up rather more questions than it answered.

Because if ever there was a prime example of the precarious tightrope upon which top-level rugby operates this was it. Big finals are all about winning but had a Martian beamed down to watch his first game of union he would have left confused. How come earthlings call this sport when for lengthy periods the players simply stand around drinking from plastic water bottles? Why does the referee keep drawing imaginary rectangles in the sky and referring endless decisions “upstairs” when he is far nearer the action than anyone else? And does he not have a home to go to?

This NFL-isation of rugby is natural to some degree but when Luke Pearce is on screen more often than world-class players such as Dupont or Cheslin Kolbe the game has a genuine problem. As well as games spanning less than two hours – had extra time been necessary this contest would have lasted almost as long as the Eurovision Song Contest – tomorrow’s supporter will want a sport with less complicated laws and far less faffing about.

A safer spectacle is also vital which is why Levani Botia saw red for his high challenge on Maxime Médard. But how come several other debatable collisions failed to produce a card? How many players receiving lengthy in-game treatment does it take for alarm bells to ring? Would fewer hulking replacements or a collective maximum squad weight mitigate some of the risk? And what exactly are the game’s priorities when officials can repeatedly search for the grounding of an invisible ball beneath an impenetrable heap of bodies yet cannot request a replay of a Toulouse player cynically joining the last ruck of a major final from a blatantly offside position?

Oval-shaped perfection of course tends to be unattainable but what if a “captain’s challenge” had been available in those last few seconds as is currently being trialled in the Rainbow Cup? La Rochelle would have had a penalty and kicked it to the corner; as Ronan O’Gara observed the stats suggest they may well have driven over for a try with a winning conversion to come.

Then again as mentioned how long would such a chain of events have taken to play out? And would the occasion really have been enhanced by the other law trial in operation which allows any team whose player has been sent off to revert to 15 men after 20 minutes? Botia’s law as it may yet become known would assuredly have made Toulouse’s life harder.

So potentially will the looming introduction of South African provincial sides to the tournament. Next month Covid complications permitting there is every prospect of their being officially admitted to next season’s Challenge Cup with the opportunity to feature in the Champions Cup the following year.

Whether a European final between the Bulls and the Stormers at Murrayfield will grab the uncommitted by their lapels remains to be seen but on the flip side it may be one way of preventing the big French sides from dominating proceedings for the foreseeable future.

Toulouse may have been relatively pedestrian for lengthy periods on Saturday but well-funded French clubs such as themselves La Rochelle Racing 92 Bordeaux-Bègles Clermont Auvergne and Montpellier 18-17 winners of Friday night’s Challenge Cup final against Leicester view European success as a priority.

Antoine Dupont proves his class to fans after final whistle of Champions Cup final

Antoine Dupont truly showed his class after the Champions Cup final this weekend when he came up to La Rochelle players after the final whistle.

French side Toulouse became European Champions this weekend after a hard-fought win over rivals La Rochelle in London.

The final score was close with just a few points separating the sides in the end.

It was a sensational kicking performance from Romain Ntamack which sealed the win for the men in red giving the French side their sixth ever European title.

The Eaton Fire Protection District Board of Directors decided to donate their engine to a department that could utilize it more than they were as a training engine.

Thomas Healy of the Howard Volunteer Fire Department worked with the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control to contact departments throughout the state with regards to older equipment they may be willing to donate.

The Howard Volunteer Fire Department was in need of improved newer used equipment since the department is 100% dependent upon donations from the generous citizens of Howard and most of the engines/apparatus utilized by the department are aging out of service quickly. Newer fire engines are difficult to purchase for non-tax district volunteer organizations because of the expense.

The Howard board and firefighters are ecstatic and thankful to the good folks of Eaton Fire Protection District for their generous donation and for the help from the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control. The donated engine will now be the primary first out response vehicle for HVFD.

Patient Keller sent 12 batters to the plate in a nine-run sixth inning on the way to a 13-10 victory in a best-of-3 regional quarterfinal series Saturday afternoon at Denton Guyer.

“That’s one of the craziest games I can remember” longtime Keller coach Rob Stramp said. “It was a roller-coaster. I never felt comfortable. I told ‘em we need to keep scoring.”

Eaton (29-12) the fourth-place seed in District 4-6A led 5-4 going into the sixth then found themselves trailing 13-5 in the bottom of the seventh. Then Eaton staged a rally of its own for five runs capped by the game’s only home run a three-run blast over the left-field wall by Silas Voegely.

“Two years ago Keller just obliterated us and earlier this year the same thing” Eaton coach Jeremy Fatheree said. “We are taking steps in the right direction against the team that I believe will win the state championship.”

Eaton forced a third game with a 2-1 victory in Game 2 on Friday. Keller the District 4-6A champion opened the series with a 9-4 win Thursday.

Keller starting pitcher Braden Davis improved his record to 4-0 and the Sam Houston state signee helped his cause with two hits a sacrifice fly and two RBIs.

“We set big goals for ourselves before the season” Davis said. “Our defense wasn’t working all that well today but the offense came through.”

Both teams appeared stressed defensively combining for nine errors. Eaton was charged with six and four of those came in the third inning when Keller went in front 2-1.

Three ground balls that could gotten Eaton starting pitcher Landon Kinder out of the inning with a 1-0 lead were turned into extra outs for Keller. The errors also worked against Kinder’s pitch count. He left with two outs in the fourth inning for the first of five Eaton relievers.

Consecutive two-out doubles by Easton Andrews and Xavier Casserilla fueled a three-run Eaton outburst in the bottom of the fifth for a short-lived 5-4 lead.

Thoms and Mike Dattalo joined Davis with two hits for Keller. Nolan Bushko Voegely and Andrews had two hits for Eaton.

Frisco Wakeland 5 The Colony 1: Blake Sedatole’s goal Saturday was simple: pitch a complete game.

The Frisco Wakeland senior pitcher was able to do that with something his opponent The Colony was lacking: sharpness.

Sedatole had a solid outing in making his goal while his Wakeland teammates took advantage of walks and errors for their offense in a 5-1 win in the third and deciding game of a Class 5A Region II quarterfinal series at Little Elm High School’s Lobo Field in a showdown of state-ranked squads.

Sedatole struck out four but his slider kept The Colony off-balance as he scattered five hits and one walk. His pitches led to routine outs for his defense and a couple remarkable plays with the best being a diving catch by center fielder Addison Brown that ended the fourth inning that probably robbed The Colony’s Jack Jack Farr of a multi-run multi-base hit.

“A complete game is what I go for every time. I feel great. If I threw 100 pitches I feel like I could throw 100 more” Sedatole said. “Addison’s catch was the biggest play. If he doesn’t catch it they score two runs we lose the momentum and their lineup could have got hot.”

Wakeland (31-10) ranked No. 9 in the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association’s Class 5A state poll advanced to face Corsicana in the 5A Region II semifinals with details to be determined. It’s the sixth time Wakeland has advanced to the regional semifinal round since 2010.

No. 8-ranked The Colony (25-9-2) was eliminated by Wakeland for the second time in five years also losing in the area round in 2017.

The Colony took a 1-0 lead in the top of the first inning as Madaven Tillery was hit by a pitch and eventually came home on Ryan Scott’s sacrifice fly to right.

Wakeland’s offense managed just two hits but one was Conor Linkfield’s single in the bottom of the first and he scored on Connor Cassano’s fielder’s choice. On the same play an errant throw allowed Blake Morrow to score from second.

Wakeland scored three more runs in the second as Jason Young and Brown drew walks and scored on a bases-loaded walk by Linkfield and a sacrifice fly to left by Morrow respectively. Dylan Snead also scored in the inning on an errant throw one of four errors by The Colony.

Cade Irwin took the loss. Relief pitcher J.T. Fichera kept The Colony in the game throwing 4 1/3 shutout innings with three strikeouts and two walks. The Colony’s Nick Olivera was the lone multi-hit batter of the game beating out two infield hits.

Ballymena's James Kennedy bats. Picture by Jonathan Porter/Press Eye

The 42-year-old joined from Ballymena – a club he had played all of his senior cricket at up to the point of heading to Stormont – prior to the 2017 season and captained them to the 2018 Challenge Cup final where they lost out to Waringstown.

Kennedy had already relinquished the captaincy he held for three seasons with former Irish international Gary Wilson taking over for the 2021 campaign but when he watched the array of young stars practicing there was something telling the batsman that it was time to head back home to Eaton Park.

The original plan was to stay at CSNI for three years but his love for the club meant he extended that by an extra season and as Kennedy explains he came very close to making it a fifth.

“I always said that I would go back to Ballymena at some point before I stopped playing” he said.

“The wrench of trying to leave CSNI over the last few years has been tough because I haven’t wanted to leave and I really enjoyed my experience there.

“I had intended to leave after three years but they got stuck with me for a fourth year because I was enjoying it so much and they very nearly got stuck with me for a fifth year but I made a last-minute decision based on a few things that I should stay true to my word and return to Ballymena before I have no cricketing ability left!

“I stood down from the captaincy in November and was very happy with that decision. It was a very last-minute decision to leave.

“CSNI are a very strong club with a strong youth structure and after a couple of pre-season nets I stood back and had a long conversation with Gary who tried to twist my arm but just couldn’t in the end!

“The number of young players coming through will get so much value from playing with experienced players like Thommo (Stuart Thompson) and Gary.

“Although I still might have been able to offer something – which is maybe debateable in itself – I felt it was a great chance to get some of these young lads into the team who will become good CSNI players in the future if not at a next level up.

“I just felt all in all that it was the right time.”

One of the driving factors behind Kennedy’s move to the Belfast club was his desire to win a Challenge Cup title and he came within a game of doing just that.

It was the temptation of having another crack at achieving his main goal that almost made him stick around for another year.

“There were a few factors to why I went to CSNI but ultimately it was to win a Challenge Cup” he added.

“That was a big draw in going to CSNI and it’s my biggest regret in my time there.

“We got to a final which was a superb experience but just didn’t get our hands on the trophy.

“What a final it was with two brilliant hundreds from Elly (Marc Ellison) and Denny (Adam Dennison).

“There are probably very few weeks go by where I don’t wonder if that result could have been different if Grum (Graeme McCarter) hadn’t been sick but there are more important things in life than cricket and that’s something we will never know the answer to.

“That was a big disappointment and it’s why I hung on for a fourth year and considered a fifth year.”

He will now focus all of his energy on trying to help Ballymena reach the pinnacle of NCU club cricket once again.

They were last in the top-flight back in 2015 and suffered consecutive relegations to Section Two before promotion back to the second tier in 2018.

Ballymena have started this season with two defeats to Saintfield and Derriaghy but the club remain ambitious and Kennedy’s experience could go a long way to helping them achieve their goals.

“It’s quite refreshing to go back to Ballymena and hear the young lads talking about wanting to get promoted to the Premier League” he said.

“I suppose the older hands are slightly more cautious about that because they know just how challenging that can be.

“Ballymena probably punched above their weight for a long time and we probably stayed in the Premier League longer than we needed to in terms of bringing our younger players on.

“The young players that haven’t been there before are keen to do so and hopefully we can challenge at the top of Section One in years to come.",,,

eBay warned “Tell Your Senators Not To Harm Local Small Businesses!” in the subject mail of its email and it said:

Under the bill sellers would have to:

provide online marketplaces with extensive personal information including tax ID numbers and government-issued identification cards in order to be verified to sell on an online marketplace;

certify annually – at the risk of account suspension – that their information has not changed; and

publicly display their full name and contact information including address email and phone number on each product listed for sale.

Etsy’s email also asked sellers to contact their senators about the bill that it said would put the privacy safety and security of home-based sellers at risk.

On a page on its website Etsy stated:

“The US Senate is considering new legislation called the INFORM Act which would require Etsy to collect verify and display seller contact information on product listing pages. For many home-based business owners this legislation would mean sharing your personal information widely online including your full name home address telephone number and email address.

“Lawmakers have simply not considered how this bill would impact the privacy safety and security of Etsy sellers who run their businesses from their homes. That’s why they need to hear from you!”

An EcommerceBytes reader forwarded the email that sported the subject line “Etsy sellers: Protect your privacy by opposing the Cassidy INFORM Amendment.” The seller wrote “I’m thinking of contacting the Senators sponsoring this and asking for their home address and phone number. Think they’ll comply?”

Both emails linked to pages on the respective marketplaces’ websites that allowed sellers to easily contact lawmakers about the issue through an online form.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdG9uZWRlYWYudGhlYnJhZy5jb20vYnJpdG5leS1zcGVhcnMtYXVkaXRpb25pbmctZm9yLXRoZS1ub3RlYm9vay1lYmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A tape of Britney Spears auditioning for The Notebook is listed on eBay,"This is not a drill: a never seen recording of pop princess Britney Spears auditioning for the box office hit The Notebook has emerged on eBay.

“The Notebook made Rachel McAdams a star. Little does anyone know Britney Spears also auditioned for the role! It’s never before seen until now. It was recorded on April 18th 2002 on Sony Hi8mm. Her audition (with Ryan Gosling reading) runs one second short of 10 minutes.

“Own a piece of HISTORY!

A super sleuth Spears fan uncovered the eBay auction and took to Twitter to share the exciting news.

In 2004 Gosling confirmed that Spears did indeed read for the role of Allie a role which ended up going to Rachel McAdams. “We met with a lot of actresses and they were all very good” Gosling told ET. “I did [screen test with Spears] yeah. I hadn’t seen her really since she was about 12 — we were both 12 — so she’s grown up but she was really good actually. She did a really nice job. We were 12 I don’t remember much from when I was 12 but yeah no she did an excellent job actually. That was cool.” Spears also alluded to the fact that she had auditioned for The Notebook when she revealed in a 2001 interview with Richard Blackwood that she had read for a role in a “love story” movie. “What would excite me? Probably to get this amazing movie this script that I read. They already have someone doing it but I would die if I got to do it.” “You’re trying to tell me they’re choosing somebody over you?” Blackwood asked Spears. “I’m not gonna say! I can’t do that” Spears said. “It’s the most amazing script I ever read.” “What type of movie is it then?” “It’s a love story of course” she replied.

However there are two days left and no bids have been placed so far.

4 Reviews

Gold plating or some fancy hardware mods never managed to bring the price of the PlayStation 4 as high as the autograph of CoryxKenshin often hailed as one of the most popular online players on the planet. While a starting price on eBay doesn't necessarily reflect the value of a product it is worth taking a closer look at what appears to be the most expensive PlayStation 4 so far: no less than US$25000 starting price for a slim 1 TB console.

The product description reveals that the console was won through one of CoryxKenshin's giveaways and includes a copy of Battlefront II. The PlayStation 4 is unused still in the original box. The console was taken out only two times: when CoryxKenshin autographed it and when the seller had to take the shots for the eBay listing.

While we all can agree that the US$25000 price tag is simply insane the good part is that the seller is also open to negotiation. Since there are no bids yet and there are two days left until the end of the auction it will be interesting to see the final price if any. How much do you think is worth this console given the fact that CoryxKenshin hasn't posted a video in months and he might have silently retired? As usual the comments section is all yours.

It is worth noting that the physical version of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition the last title published by EA on consoles was oficially released in Brazil on May 21 a few days later than the worlwide release date.

Three weeks ago EA announced that a next-gen version of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order would be released later this summer (winter in the Southern Hemisphere) with a free upgrade for current owners. Today some Brazilian retailers have listed the PS5 version of the game with a June 26 release date.

Management is forecasting that EA Sports viewers and players will two-fold in the next 5 years to 500 million. In this article we will see the recent rise of EA in the mobile gaming industry and how it will be a global leading corporate for the next 5 years. Wilson credited his company’s record fiscal year results to live operations of games that are run as continuous live services rather than just one-time purchases.

EA: an evergrowing gaming giant

Wilson stated that over 230 million individuals in the last year participated in EA Sports content and games with EA producing 6 original sports titles in the financial year 2021. Wilson said: “We believe we can grow to 500 million players and viewers in EA Sports experiences over the next 5 years. This can have a huge effect on the gaming industry as a whole as the gaming world reverberates with digital currencies. The virtual currency has been a massive part of gaming for more than a decade.



Recently the gaming industry’s effects on Forex and stock markets have been quite significant. It’s bigger than the music and movie industries put together! The increase in today’s gaming contests with enormous cash prizes has propelled video game users to fame as have streaming platforms such as Twitch and video-sharing platforms such as YouTube.

1. Apex Legends Alive and Kicking

On March 9 the Nintendo Switch will support Apex Legends with the game being made available as a preview release on mobile in the next 3 to 4 months. Leading financial officer Blake Jorgensen predicts the game will make over $500 million in bookings this financial year. Wilson divulged he’s thrilled about the forthcoming purchase of Codemasters for $1.2 billion a trade that’ll see EA launch additional racing titles like F1.

2. FIFA: EA’s own monopoly

In South Korea FIFA Online 4 sees more users each quarter of 2021 as opposed to 2020 and EA currently boasts 21 million users in FIFA Mobile Asia. On this Wilson further added

“We are bringing FIFA Online to new territories — including Russia Poland and Turkey — with a combined audience of 80 million players. We are also accelerating our focus on mobile with 6 new soccer mobile experiences in development today for different regions and genres.”

What’s more Wilson claims Madden NFL has the most users it’s ever had engrossed in the game. Each year NHL engagement has increased by 13% and since its introduction UFC 4 continues to see 20% extra users each day than the earlier version. Wilson also alleged that FIFA has become increasingly popular with Gen Z gamers. But the organization has underachieved in basketball over the last five years which has been disheartening. Thus EA is trying to revolutionize the game.

3. Star Wars Continues

Star Wars fans will be pleased to know that Ubisoft intends to launch Star Wars as an open-world game. Wilson revealed that the organization’s Star Wars games have sold over 52 million copies making $3 billion in profits.

The mobile version of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is a billion-dollar license. Wilson believes that while other gaming corporations are producing Star Wars-based games this won’t have an impact on the company’s obligation to the Star Wars copyright.

4. The Sims 4 Boasts 33 Million Users

The Sims 4 is currently at 33 million users with Maxis Studios providing the 10th development package for the title. EA’s subscription service currently has 13 million customers using platforms like the EA client PlayStation Steam and Xbox.

Final thoughts

Boasting more users engaging with the company’s subscription services as well as the sheer amount of content and platforms being used EA is developing a robust expanding business with frequent profits. EA also has an increasing number of streaming players connecting with their network via Xbox Cloud Gaming with Game Pass Ultimate. Cloud will soon be integral to EA’s gaming network. On the whole EA will be launching over 35 forthcoming games in different levels of development and expansion. EA is expected to generate profits on top of its $6.1 billion predicted for the financial year ending March 31.

These results are being presented virtually at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) May 21-23 2021 .

Mirikizumab is being studied for UC and CD two forms of inflammatory bowel disease that can cause serious and debilitating symptoms and disruptions in daily life.

""New data at DDW show that fatigue is more than a symptom of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease – two chronic inflammatory bowel diseases that can be challenging to treat. It can also be an important predictor for the severity of a person's disease and the potential impact it has on their quality of life"" said Miguel Regueiro  M.D. chair of Gastroenterology Hepatology & Nutrition at Cleveland Clinic and lead author of these analyses. ""The data from Lilly 's Phase 2 study show mirikizumab may help improve fatigue in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease reinforcing the importance of further study into mirikizumab as a potential treatment for those living with this disease.""

Mirikizumab Demonstrated Improvements in Fatigue

In SERENITY patients treated with mirikizumab saw improvements in fatigue during the induction period of 12 weeks as measured by the mean change in FACIT-Fatigue scores from baseline compared to placebo (mirikizumab 200 mg: 10.81±1.73 p<0.001; 600 mg: 9.09±1.72 p=0.004; 1000 mg 9.62±1.22 p<0.001; placebo: 2.90±1.21). The FACIT–Fatigue scale is a validated 13-item questionnaire which assesses the impact of fatigue on daily activities in patients with chronic illnesses.

At the end of the 12-week induction period patients treated with mirikizumab who achieved ≥1 point improvement in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) were re-randomized 1:1 to continue to receive the same once-monthly IV treatment or once-monthly mirikizumab 300 mg administered subcutaneously up to 52 weeks. Patients who received mirikizumab and did not have SES-CD improvement at 12 weeks and those who received placebo during induction received once-monthly mirikizumab 1000 mg administered intravenously up to one year.

At one year improvements in fatigue were sustained among those treated with mirikizumab. For methodology see ""About the Analyses"" section below.

In addition to these data previously-presented results evaluating the efficacy and safety of mirikizumab through 52 weeks will also be presented virtually at DDW this year. In this study the safety results were consistent with that of mirikizumab in UC and with the class.

Fatigue Among Patients with UC or CD is Associated with Higher Levels of Disease Activity Decreased Work Productivity and Reduced Well-Being

In a real-world data analysis of the Study of a Prospective Adult Research Cohort with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SPARC IBD) more than 40% of patients with UC (n=181) and nearly half of patients living with CD (47.7% n=431) reported living with fatigue as measured by those who indicated whether they had experienced fatigue within the last week.

Patients with UC who reported fatigue (n=184) also had higher levels of disease activity (2.1 [1.86] vs. 0.7 [1.21] p<0.01) missed more days of work or school (6.1 days [33.21] vs. 0.2 days [1.32] p=0.05) and reported reduced general well-being (those who ranked general well-being as ""poor to terrible"" or ""slightly under par"": 111 [61.6%] vs. 52 [20%] p<0.01) compared to patients with UC who did not report fatigue (n=265). No statistically significant differences were seen in disease duration (11.6 years [10.27] vs. 11.6 years [9.94] p=0.99).

Patients with CD who reported fatigue (n=431) had longer disease duration (15.4 years [11.13] vs. 13.8 years [9.64] p=0.03) higher levels of disease activity (157.7 [97.57] vs. 83.8 [55.26] p<0.01) missed more days of work or school (6.1 days [26.69] vs. 0.4 days [2.11] p<0.01) and reported reduced general well-being (those who ranked general well-being as ""poor to terrible"" or ""slightly under par"": 271 [62.9%] vs. 97 [20.6%] p<0.01) compared to those with CD who did not report fatigue (n=472). For methodology see ""About the Analyses"" section below.

Results from two analyses of a cross-sectional survey were also presented at DDW which evaluated the burden of fatigue and rectal urgency respectively among 1057 patients with UC and 1228 patients with CD.

""Fatigue is a key symptom to monitor in people living with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease as it is prevalent in both conditions and associated with higher levels of disease activity decreased work productivity and worse quality of life"" said Prentice C. Stovall  Jr. Global Development Leader Immunology at Lilly . "" Lilly is excited to present data that offer important insights for gastroenterologists when treating patients with UC and CD and they reinforce the need for additional treatment options that can offer meaningful improvements for the burdensome symptoms of these diseases.""

About The Analyses

Mirikizumab Therapy is Associated with Improved Fatigue in Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease

At baseline 191 patients from the Phase 2 SERENITY trial were randomized 2:1:1:2 to once-monthly placebo mirikizumab 200 mg mirikizumab 600 mg or mirikizumab 1000 mg administered intravenously. At 12 weeks patients treated with mirikizumab who achieved ≥1 point improvement in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) from baseline were re-randomized 1:1 to continue to receive the same once-monthly IV treatment assignment or to once-monthly mirikizumab 300 mg administered subcutaneously up to 52 weeks. Patients who received mirikizumab and did not have any SES-CD improvement at 12 weeks and those who received placebo during induction received once-monthly mirikizumab 1000 mg administered intravenously up to 52 weeks. Fatigue was measured using the FACIT–Fatigue scale a validated 13-item questionnaire which assesses the impact of fatigue on daily activities. Change from baseline to 12 weeks and 52 weeks in FACIT-Fatigue were calculated. P-values shown above are not adjusted for multiplicity. The effect of mirikizumab on rectal urgency was not evaluated in this study.

Prevalence of Fatigue among Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Patients: Analyses from SPARC IBD

Real-world data from 443 people with UC and 903 people with CD were analyzed in the Study of a Prospective Adult Research Cohort with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SPARC IBD). Patients indicated if they experienced fatigue within the last week and were categorized as either having fatigue or not having fatigue. Descriptive and contingency table analyses were conducted to determine the overall prevalence of fatigue. In both patients with UC and CD disease duration was measured by mean number of years and number of days of work or school missed was measured by mean number of days in the past 12 months. For patients with UC disease activity was measured by a mean UC Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) 6-point score and for patients with CD disease activity was measured by mean simplified CD activity index (sCDAI) score.

About Mirikizumab

Mirikizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23. Mirikizumab is being studied for the treatment of immune diseases including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

About the Mirikizumab Phase 2 Trial in Crohn's Disease

SERENITY the Phase 2 multi-center randomized parallel-arm double-blind placebo-controlled trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. At baseline participants were randomized with a 2:1:1:2 allocation across four treatment arms (placebo mirikizumab 200 mg mirikizumab 600 mg and mirikizumab 1000 mg). The primary endpoint was endoscopic response as determined by the proportion of participants achieving at least 50 percent reduction from baseline on the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) at Week 12. In May 2019 Lilly reported Phase 2 results showing more patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease receiving mirikizumab achieved clinical remission and response at 12 weeks. Overall the safety profile at 12 weeks was consistent with that of mirikizumab in studies of ulcerative colitis and with the class.

About Crohn's Disease

Crohn's disease which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune-mediated condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Crohn's most commonly affects the end of the small bowel (the ileum) and the beginning of the colon but it may affect any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus. IBD which is inclusive of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis affects 10 million people worldwide.

About Ulcerative Colitis

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon. UC occurs when the immune system sends white blood cells into the lining of the intestines where they produce chronic inflammation and ulcerations. There is an unmet need for additional treatment options for UC that provide meaningful symptom relief including bowel urgency and deliver sustained clinical remission.

By contrast the median gain from real estate ownership for white and Pakistani families over that period is around 115000 pounds or about $163000. The median household net property wealth for Indian families is 176000 pounds or $250000.

Other ethnic groups’ gains were somewhere in between. Those figures subtract debts and mortgages held against their assets.

There is debate about the reasons for the disparity but a contributing factor is that most Black families in the U.K. — 30 percent — do not own a home. Around 60 percent of Black people in the U.K. live in London where high living costs eat up money that could otherwise be saved or put toward a home.

Black Brits are more likely to be paid less than other ethnic groups for the same job and more likely to see their neighborhoods become unaffordable according to Joseph Rowntree Foundation senior analyst Andrea Barry Bloomberg reported.

And they have described difficulty getting home loans from banks. Lack of access to affordable mortgages has also contributed to difficulty building wealth among residents of formerly redlined neighborhoods in the United States.

A recent report from the U.K. government’s Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities disputes that institutional racism is driving wealth disparities.

The 258-page report said “geography family influence socio-economic background culture and religion have more significant impact on life chances than the existence of racism” which it acknowledged is “a real force in the U.K.”

Snapchat users can now “try on” and buy MAC makeup products through a filter on the app.

Snap Inc which owns Snapchat launched the new feature in partnership with Estée Lauder Companies. MAC Cosmetics is the first brand in the Estée Lauder portfolio to launch the augmented reality (AR) technology on the platform.

The filter known as dynamic shopping lenses allows users to choose from four lenses to try on 20 different lip and eye makeup products from MAC.

If they like a particular look they can tap through the lens to shop and purchase the product directly through Snapchat.

As well as makeup users can also “try on” clothes virtually through the platform’s partnership with online luxury retailer FARFETCH.

“FARFETCH provides an immersive shopping experience using 3D Body Mesh and voice-enabled controls so you can ask for items you’re looking to browse and try on instantly with AR” said Snap.

The new technology comes after a survey commissioned by Snap found that demand for AR shopping has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic with 94 per cent of people expecting to use AR for shopping the same amount of more in 2022 compared to 2021.

On average more than 200 million people engage with AR technology on Snapchat everyday said the company in its survey report.

According to the report over half of consumers want to use AR technology as a “risk-free try before you buy experience” with 56 per cent agreeing the technology gives them more confidence about product quality.

Salima Popatia senior vice president of global consumer acquisition and retention at Estée Lauder told Forbes that the new lenses are a “game-changer for social media and e-commerce”.

“It’s a complete reframing of consumer intent and the marketing funnel - driven by impulse driven by the moment driven by creative inspiration; the media becomes the store” she said.

Snap’s head of global product marketing Carolina Arguelles added that the lenses give consumers a better sense of how a product looks on them rather than on a model.

“Instead Snapchatters can see products on themselves determine if it’s the right style and fit ask their friends for advice and tap to purchase all within Snapchat.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlcmZlY3Rjb3JwLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9ibG9nL2NvbW1lcmNlL21hc3Rlci1zb2NpYWwtY29tbWVyY2Utd2l0aC1zbmFwY2hhdC1keW5hbWljLXNob3BwYWJsZS1sZW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Master Social Commerce with Snapchat's Dynamic Shoppable Lens | PERFECT,,,,,,,,,,

eBay warned “Tell Your Senators Not To Harm Local Small Businesses!” in the subject mail of its email and it said:

Under the bill sellers would have to:

provide online marketplaces with extensive personal information including tax ID numbers and government-issued identification cards in order to be verified to sell on an online marketplace;

certify annually – at the risk of account suspension – that their information has not changed; and

publicly display their full name and contact information including address email and phone number on each product listed for sale.

Etsy’s email also asked sellers to contact their senators about the bill that it said would put the privacy safety and security of home-based sellers at risk.

On a page on its website Etsy stated:

“The US Senate is considering new legislation called the INFORM Act which would require Etsy to collect verify and display seller contact information on product listing pages. For many home-based business owners this legislation would mean sharing your personal information widely online including your full name home address telephone number and email address.

“Lawmakers have simply not considered how this bill would impact the privacy safety and security of Etsy sellers who run their businesses from their homes. That’s why they need to hear from you!”

An EcommerceBytes reader forwarded the email that sported the subject line “Etsy sellers: Protect your privacy by opposing the Cassidy INFORM Amendment.” The seller wrote “I’m thinking of contacting the Senators sponsoring this and asking for their home address and phone number. Think they’ll comply?”

Both emails linked to pages on the respective marketplaces’ websites that allowed sellers to easily contact lawmakers about the issue through an online form.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wNS8yMi9iYW5rc3ktb2YtcmFlLWR1bm4tZHJvcGxpZnRzLXByby1iaXJ0aC1jb250cm9sLXByb2R1Y3RzLWluLWhvYmJ5LWxvYmJ5Lmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL2JvaW5nYm9pbmcubmV0LzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvYmFua3N5LW9mLXJhZS1kdW5uLWRyb3BsaWZ0cy1wcm8tYmlydGgtY29udHJvbC1wcm9kdWN0cy1pbi1ob2JieS1sb2JieS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Banksy of Rae Dunn"" droplifts pro-birth control products in Hobby Lobby","TikTokker Anneke Roberts of Grand Rapids Michigan is doing the Lord's work.

(Rusty's Electric Dreams)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vOXRvNW1hYy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yMi9oYW5kcy1vbi0zZC1wcmludGluZy1icmluZ3MtY3VzdG9taXphdGlvbi10by1haXJ0YWctY2FzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hands-on: 3D printing brings customization to AirTag cases,"With no included method of attaching AirTags to a keychain cases are a necessity for most AirTag users. Apple has their own first-party accessories for AirTags starting at $29 and we’ve done a breakdown of the best AirTag keychains but many have been creating custom AirTag keychains using 3D printers to fit their own needs.

With 3D printers like the Ender 3 breaking below the $200 price point they have seen far more use in the home. By heating up a low-cost plastic filament they are able to build small objects layer by layer. Users create or download 3D models usually in the form of STL files from sites like Thingiverse. Using slicing software you can prepare the 3D model for the 3D printer adjusting settings such as the layer height and speed to balance quality and time.

With each AirTag case only using a few cents worth of filament and taking a couple of minutes to print we decided to print and test a few of these 3D printed cases as well as design one of our own. We printed all of these cases on a Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus 3D printer with gray Priline PLA filament. We printed with a layer height of 0.1mm and a speed of 75mm/s.

Simple AirTag keychain

The first AirTag case we tried was a slim and simple single piece keychain designed by user AnonymousHermit on Thingiverse. The AirTag snaps in and is heldy firmly in place by the rim. It allows both faces of the AirTag to be easily seen and you can even replace the battery without removing it from the case. With a solid attachment point for a keyring I would aboslutely recommend this case.

Apple TV remote AirTag case

We previously covered another 3D printed Apple TV remote case that is available for purchase on Etsy for $12.99. This Apple TV remote case (first-gen Siri Remote) designed by ururk on Thingiverse sits only at the base of the remote. Only being held to the remote by friction it is about as small as an AirTag case for the Apple TV remote can be. It avoids adding too much unnecessary bulk to the device and leaves plenty of room around the Lightning port. While I like the simplicity of this model those seeking a more ergonomic solution may prefer this larger two-piece print instead. Stay tuned for a similar solution for the new Apple TV remote.

Apple logo-shaped keychain

This Apple shaped AirTag keyring was designed by user Furika on Thingiverse. It prints in 2 parts that firmly snap together for a secure fit around the AirTag. Unfortunately one complication from this design is a result of that iconic bite mark. The AirTag isn’t located directly in the center of the Apple logo so the AirTag needs to be put in with the Apple logo facing the thinner side. Otherwise it appears off-center as seen below. As is the two sides of the keyring are well designed to hide that the AirTag is located off-center.

SpaceX Dragon capsule AirTag keyring

Being content manager over at Space Explored I’m a massive space fan. I wanted an AirTag keyring that could show my love of space exploration. I couldn’t find any existing keyrings available for sale or download so I designed this SpaceX Dragon Capsule AirTag keyring as a simple extrusion from a Silhouette of the SpaceX vehicle. The keyring is based on the same securement method as the first keyring and I used that 3D model as a reference for the AirTag section of the keyring. It’s a tight fit for the AirTag but there’s no way it’ll fall out by mistake.

AirPod cases drone attachments dog collars and more

3D printing opens up myriad opportunities for customization from purely creative changes to improvements in utility. Whether you want to mount an AirTag to your drone or to your dog there are 3d models available. If you are prone to losing your headphones users have already designed cases for both the AirPod Pro and AirPod Max.

Even if you don’t have a 3D printer you can find many of these cases available for sale on Etsy. There are also many low-cost third-party keychains like this 3 pack of AirTag cases for $10.95.",,,,,,

With games now taking up hundreds of gigabytes and Windows updates needing significantly more space than they used to you may find your drive filling up more often. Fortunately we have a few quick tricks to help you clear clutter for whatever you need.

The Simple Stuff

The most obvious tip dates back to the Windows 95 days. Evidently emptying your recycle bin is one of the quickest ways to free up space. If you like to live dangerously you can go to your Recycle Bin properties and enable the option to remove files immediately whenever they're deleted but we don't recommend it.

Either way we just mention this because if you like to keep your desktop clean of any icons (see here how you can relocate the Recycle Bin) it may be weeks since you last emptied it. Also Windows 10's Storage Sense feature defaults to empty the bin after 30 days.

Uninstall unnecessary apps and bloatware

This also may seem like a simple idea but Windows comes with a bunch of applications and features that may be useless to you. Go into the App Settings window and you'll be able to remove applications quickly through the menu there. Apps like Mixed Reality can be uninstalled from this menu but if you want to remove other unused features click Optional features and you can get rid of items like Windows Media Player or Internet Explorer 11.

Third party tools like Revo Uninstaller can help in this task and make it a 3-click affair. These tools can also delete any leftover files after using Window's solutions ensuring that everything is cleaned up.

Temporary Files

Going to Settings > System > Storage will offer you a chance to see how much space is being taken up by Temporary files or Downloads. Clicking on Temporary Files allows you to get a more granular understanding of the storage usage and you can select the checkboxes that apply when you press the ""Remove files"" button.

Disk Cleanup

One extra way to take control of your space is to use Windows built-in Disk Cleanup utility. Disk Cleanup is part of the Windows Administrative Tools folder in your Start Menu or you can just search for it within the menu.

Upon launch choose the drive to clean up and the application will show all the items you can clean up from temporary files to thumbnails and system files like previous Windows installations (and Windows.old folders) and files needed for updates. Select what you want to delete and hit ""OK"" to finish the task.

Storage Sense

More recent versions of Windows 10 have an automated disk cleanup utility known as Storage Sense. Find it in the System Settings > Storage.

Setting up Storage Sense allows Windows to automatically delete temporary files as well as items in your downloads and Recycle Bin after a set period.

Default Save Locations

Windows sets the default save locations for documents videos pictures downloads and other items to a folder on the drive Windows is installed on. Those who use a lean drive for the operating system but other drives for games and files will want to change this setting to free up space on the main drive.

Clicking the ""Change where new content is saved"" button will allow you to do that. This page will allow you to change the default save locations and even install locations for new files and apps.

OneDrive ""Files On-Demand""

Those of you relying on OneDrive can also use a handy feature known as Files On-Demand. While the cloud drive account is handy for saving files in a centralized location OneDrive also lets you use files in an online-only format downloading the item when you need it and deleting the local file when space is low.

To turn this feature on go to your OneDrive settings and check the box under Files On-Demand. Then when you see your OneDrive files they will be presented in three different statuses: blue cloud files are only available online items with a green checkmark in a white circle are locally stored files that will revert to the cloud when you run short on space and files with a white checkmark in a green circle are locally stored which won't get reverted to the cloud.

Deleting Users

If you have shared your PC with someone who no longer uses the device you can delete their account along with the files and folders associated with them. This is done through the Account Settings.

Click on the Family & Other Users item on the sidebar then select the account that is no longer in use. From there click the Remove button which will trigger an extra dialogue about deleting the account and data. Once you decide to delete the account you'll be freeing up the space used by that user on your drive.

Disable Hibernate

Hibernation is an energy efficient alternative to putting your computer to sleep. It writes your current system state to the drive and allows you to turn off the PC and return to that state when you turn it back on. It also takes up several gigabytes of space. In order to disable it open a command prompt as a administrator and type in the following:

powercfg /hibernate off

This will help save you plenty of storage though Hibernate will be disabled. If you want to re-enable Hibernate just open a command prompt as a administrator again and type enter the following: powercfg /hibernate on

Use the Compact OS Tool

Compact OS is a tool designed for devices with very limited storage and can help free up plenty of space though potentially at the cost of performance. In Microsoft's own words ""Compact OS installs the operating system files as compressed file.""

We'd recommend performing a backup before you use the Compact OS tool and only use it on relatively fast storage. To use the tool open up the command prompt as an administrator. Enter the following command to compress the installation of Windows 10: compact.exe /compactOS:always

This process should save you a few gigabytes of storage. If you want to reverse the change open up a command prompt as an administrator and type in the following command: compact.exe /compactOS:never

Compress a Folder or Drive

If your drives are formatted as NTFS you'll be able to use the built-in compression feature to save some space. However this option can negatively impact your computer's performance since it's compressing and decompressing data on the go.

You can compress a folder or a drive. To compress a folder right click on it and select Properties. Then click the Advanced button. Then check the box next to ""Compress Contents to Save Disk Space"" in the Compress or Encrypt attributes section. Then click OK and Apply. You can revert these changes by clearing the check box.

If you want to compress an entire drive use File Explorer and head over to ""This PC."" Then you need to right click on the drive you want to compress and select Properties. Check the box next to ""Compress this drive to save disk space"" in the General Tab. Then click Apply. You'll then be prompted with a dialogue box asking if you want to apply the change to the drive subfolders and files. Make your selection and click OK.

If these tips are too simple and aren't getting the job done then it will be wise to get a disk analysis tool. There are a few options like WinDirStat or Space Sniffer which analyze a drive and provide a visualization of what folders and files are taking up the most space.

These visualizations can better demonstrate how much space an application program or game is using and you can find large folders or files in specific locations that are sometimes hidden or hard to find.

This is a great way to find and delete temporary files from specific applications or user data that's no longer necessary. For example within the Windows AppData folder are caches and temporary files for browsers messengers and game clients which might be ripe for deletion. Other folders can include temporary installers for AMDs or Nvidia's driver package installers.

If you need ideas of places where you might be able to regain some storage space here's a few:

Mobile backups of your phone or tablet

Files for unused web browsers instant messengers and game clients

Old OS drive images and other backup files

Emails stored locally (especially attachments)

File conversion software with media files stored in random locations

Cloud storage software with files stored locally that you can remove (Dropbox Box OneDrive etc.)

Tools that auto-update your drivers

Unused virtual machines (move them to a different drive)

Temp folders everywhere

Sometimes Windows has a significant number of old and unnecessary files within its System folder. Using tools like DriverStore Explorer can help clear up cached and outdated drivers.

There is also a lot of space reserved for Windows Component Store Files (in \Windows\WinSxS) used in customizing and updating Windows and system recovery operations. If you're desperate to clear some space enter this in a command prompt:

dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase

This action will remove outdated files as well as verify and repair the latest system files. Performing this will impact your ability to roll back after an update though but it can save significant amounts of space.

Finding and Deleting Duplicate Files

Clearing out file duplicates is a great way to free up space but it isn't always the easiest process. Fortunately there are a few third-party tools that can make the job easier.

CCleaner includes a duplicate file finder tool as does Total Commander. Some applications specialize in finding and deleting duplicate files including CloneSpy Wise Duplicate Finder Duplicate Cleaner and DupScout.

Last Resorts...

If these tips didn't help enough to free up space there are a couple more tricks that are best saved as last resorts. Windows has a built-in reset function which clears everything and starts you off with a clean slate. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Recovery. The first button will initiate the Windows 10 reset.

And finally you can always transfer files to an external drive and free up speedy internal storage for your operating system and applications but this is always the costlier option. Though in all honesty a 5TB drive for less than $100 does sound tempting.

Restaurants have gobbled up around 8550 publicly-owned curbside parking spots for their outdoor seating set-ups since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic according to city data.

Since last June City Hall and the Department of Transportation have let eateries build the dining areas in the now-former spots outside their storefronts. At the time indoor eating was restricted amid the pandemic though Mayor de Blasio has declared that the program will be permanent and year-round.

Around 11500 restaurants joined the program of which about 5700 have chosen to set up shop along the curb. That adds up to “roughly” 8550 spots transformed — out of around 3 million total parking spots across the five boroughs City Hall spokesman Mitch Schwartz said.

For the operators of TRU Astoria cafe on Ditmars Boulevard the extra space was well worth the trade-off — as business has “more than doubled” since installing dining tables along the sidewalk and curb.

“Thank god we adjusted. The extended patio. The outdoor seating. Being able to use the street. It strengthened our brand” said Yanni Stathakis 48 operations director for Astoria Hospitality Group which owns the eatery.

“People in all five boroughs are now coming to Astoria to eat here at Ditmars. It was good the city did this.”

But just across the road Sal Barretta of Alba’s Pizza said the program has taken a bite out of his business.

“My customers are telling me they aren’t coming here because they can’t find parking” said Barretta who opted not to set up dining tables in the roadbed because he figured there was plenty of space inside.

“The sheds I did not do it. Maybe I should have” Baretta said. “But we don’t need to be on the street. We have 101 seats inside. These sheds really dangerous. It’s a huge liability. It’s dirty. It’s dangerous. You’re breathing in all the exhaust from the cars.”

Baretta said the restaurant next door to his closed months ago — but its outdoor dining set-up continues to clog up potential parking spots.

“The place next door six months out of business. Still these three parking spots are closed because he left these out in the street” Baretta said. “It makes no sense but with this mayor — there’s no enforcement no oversight. I don’t know what they hell he’s doing.”

Stathakis said Astoria Hospitality Group has spent tens of thousands of dollars on outdoor dining facilities at its various restaurants — and those who didn’t make the investment lost out.

“They didn’t adapt. They didn’t add delivery and they didn’t add any outdoor dining” he said. “They are sitting ducks. They don’t know what to do. It’s unfortunate.”

Some locals support trading parking space for dining space.

“The restaurants need to survive! I think it was the best solution” remarked Steve P. 52 a lifelong Astoria resident who works for the city.

“We all have to compromise. We’ve got the greatest subway system. We should use it! It’s cheaper than the gas or the ticket.”

And one resident said the lack of parking was already a problem before the makeshift patios arrived anyway.

“Parking here has always been a clusterf–k!” said Astoria resident and bartender Joey Izzo 34. A few spots lost to outdoor dining “hasn’t changed” anything he added.

But others say it just made a bad problem worse.

“Without the sheds it was already hard to park but now? On Friday? Forget it!” software engineer Ricardo Lourenco 42 said of the situation on Astoria’s popular Broadway strip.

“I don’t even drive through there anymore” Lourenco said. “It’s a nightmare!”

City Hall argued the program has allowed countless restaurants to remain open despite New Yorkers’ aversion to indoor spaces amid COVID-19.

“In the toughest year for small businesses in recent memory the Open Restaurants program saved an estimated 100000 jobs” Schwartz said in a statement.

“It claimed less than half of one percent of the city’s parking spots. Bargains like that are hard to find in this town.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvcmFrZXItY2FtcGVyLXRyYWlsZXItZXhwbG9kZXMtaW50by1hLWZ1bGwtYmxvd24tY2FtcHNpdGUtZm9yLXlvdXItZmFtaWx5LTE2MTcxOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raker Camper Trailer Explodes Into a Full-Blown Campsite for Your Family,"“Baby I'm sick of living in a standard home.” “Huh!?” “Yeah.

What the couple above are talking about is an off road off grid towable camper known as the Raker. It’s the last family member from Australian-based Offline Campers. The only other trailer this team produces is the Domino which autoevolution featured a few months back.To get things up to speed a little bit about Offline as most folks don’t even know of their existence. Offline Campers is one of those little family-owned businesses that is seeking to do things a bit differently.Born from the passion of two outdoor enthusiasts Sam and Jenna Reynolds seeking the perfect trailer for their family needs Offline is now known for building trailers that push the boundaries of off-grid living. One of the longest journeys taken by the team has been a six-week trip through Tasmania.As for the Raker time to find out if it’s got what you need to carve your own journey. As it stands the trailer comes in with a floor length of 2950 mm (9.68 ft) height of 1550 mm (5.08 ft) and width of 1800 mm (5.90 ft). Sure it may sound small but wait till it blows up into tent mode. It seems that once the tent and living space are exposed the Raker basically doubles in length. Overall the vehicle comes in with an optional-dependent weight of 1200 kg (2645 lbs).Standard that chassis is a hot dip galvanized chassis with coil springs twin shocks and 12-inch (30.5-centimeter) brakes. High lift jack points front and rear stabilizer legs and lower stone protection are also standard. Optionally you can throw on an airbag suspension system Fox remote reservoir shocks and a 100-liter (26.4-gallon) underslung fuel tank.Waterworks are supplied by a 105-liter (27.7-gallon) rear tank with high flow pump and a shower outlet but a range of options such as 75-liter (19.8-gallon) drinking water tank charcoal water filter and Webasto water and air heaters also exists.One system that Offline gave more importance to is electrical. Electric opening Enerdrive battery monitor two 105-amp hour AGM batteries and unregulated solar input to MPPT are standard. A 40-amp DC/DC and 20-amp AC/DC charger are also supplied. Not to mention countless USB ports reading lights and camp lights.One the other hand a list of options reveals 260-watt roof mounted solar panels 400-watt to 2600-watt inverter and 2000-watt inverter from Enerdrive to name a few. Remember all these options will cost you extra so do bring more than just the $55600 Australian ($42969 U.S. at current exchange rates) needed to get yourself a Raker.One thing I enjoyed most is the amount of storage space you can find aboard this towable . 340-liter (89.8-gallon) under bed drawers 400-liter (105.6-gallon) kitchen storage and 1400 liters (369.8-gallon) of any other storage; that six-week trip is starting to sound credible. A 300-liter (79.2-gallon) front storage locker adds some extra space and a couple of jerry cans holders are also found.The tent is revealed through an unfolding of the Raker’s roof and includes innerspring mattress flooring wall trim and bedhead fabric. Options for awning extension and walls kids’ room and privacy curtains are also available and so is a solar blanket.The kitchen is an outdoor one so be prepared to cook your meals under a sunny or starry sky. Stainless-steel is the winning metal here with a smev two-burner range and sink kitchen drawer and Waeco CFX 95 fridge. You can opt for a BBQ hotplate and three-burner top if you’d like.If all that isn’t enough for you don’t forget to tell Offline exactly what you want. They'll do their best to give you the camper trailer you want and need for your lifestyle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzEwLXJvb21pZXN0LW5ldy1jYXJzLW9uLXRoZS1tYXJrZXQtaW4tMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Roomiest New Cars On The Market In 2021,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzEwLXJvb21pZXN0LW5ldy1jYXJzLW9uLXRoZS1tYXJrZXQtaW4tMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3J2ZXR0ZWJsb2dnZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvdmlkZW8tdGhpcy0xOTgwLWNvcnZldHRlLWZvci1zYWxlLWhhcy10aGUtcmFyZS12NTQtZmFjdG9yeS1yb29mLXBhbmVsLWNhcnJpZXItb3B0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[VIDEO] This 1980 Corvette for Sale Has the Rare V54 Factory Roof Panel Carrier Option - Corvette: Sales News ...,"

With 40614 coupes manufactured in St. Louis the 1980 Corvette isn’t necessarily what you think of as an ultra-rare car.

But today we bring you a video of a somewhat special ’80 Corvette up for sale at a Connecticut dealership with an option you may have read about but have probably never seen in person. I know I haven’t and fellow CorvetteBlogger Senior Editor Keith Cornett says he hasn’t either.

My first Corvette of the dozen I’ve owned over the past 38 years was a red-on-red ’80 so these cars have a special place in my heart. One of the drawbacks of the late C3s however was the fact that it was awkward to access the storage space behind the seats because the rear hatch didn’t open (until the ’82 Collector Edition solved that problem with a couple of hinges – go figure!).



This white Corvette solved that problem a couple of years before the Collector Edition just by adding the rare Roof Panel Carrier option that was outfitted to just 3755 cars that year – at a mere cost of $125.

Basically the rear deck of the car has four holes strategically placed into which special brackets are placed that with the aid of some straps then hold the roof panels in place.



While the idea was likely to provide more storage space behind the seats the salesman who’s offering this 42000-original-mile two-owner Corvette nevertheless didn’t feel comfortable going down the road with the panels on the carrier. We can’t blame him considering the pristine nature of the glass T-tops on the car even though he points out the panels are tightly locked in place out back.

He’s probably thinking about those poor souls who have forgotten to latch their C4 to C7 panels and watched them fly off into oblivion.



I have mixed feelings about this option. While I like the extra space it affords inside the car with the open roof I’m not really that crazy about the way the holes look in the back of the deck nor do I really care for the way the panels look actually mounted on the back of the car. To us it messes up the beautiful curves of the C3 as it goes down the road.

Still I can appreciate the usefulness and inexpensive nature of this option. Sales remained about the same in 1982 (with 3303 sold for $135 each) but the number declined in the final year of the third generation to 1992 ($144 cost) perhaps a result of the hinged glass offered on the Collector Editions.



What about you? Would you feel comfortable placing your roof panels on this contraption? I don’t know. I’d probably just leave the panels in a safe place at home and take the car out on a sunny day when there’s no chance of rain if I needed the space.

Three giant pension funds are set to vote against the oil titan’s management and in favor of new directors",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzIzL2V4eG9ubW9iaWwtZm91bmQtdGhlLXJlYWwtcmVhc29uLWZvci10aGUtY2xpbWF0ZS1jcmlzaXMteW91X3BhcnRuZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ExxonMobil found the real reason for the climate crisis: You,"ExxonMobil is known for pumping cars full of gas. But according to a new study it may have also pumped our language full of BS.

Using machine learning researchers at Harvard University scrutinized 50 years' worth of the oil giant's memos studies and advertisements to spot hidden patterns in how the company talked about the climate crisis — in public and in private. The evidence suggests that ExxonMobil used subtle rhetoric to shift the blame for climate change from fossil fuels to individuals and that this kind of ""discursive grooming"" might have shaped the way that scholars policymakers and the public discuss the problem today.

""What they've done is skew the conversation and make it much more about you and me than about them"" said the study's co-author Geoffrey Supran a Harvard researcher studying the history of fossil fuel companies and the climate (and a member of the Grist 50 last year). ""And that's very problematic and misleading.""

In the new study Supran and Naomi Oreskes a professor of history at Harvard used computational linguistics to help reveal patterns in language that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. They used algorithms to process the rhetoric in 180 company documents including publicly available internal memos peer-reviewed academic studies written by ExxonMobil scientists and paid advertorials published in the New York Times op-ed pages — what Supran called a ""treasure troves of information.""

They found that in company communication and academic papers ExxonMobil often used phrases like ""fossil fuel"" and recognized the major role their products play in heating up the globe. But its public communications focused on ""consumers"" ""demand"" and ""energy efficiency"" implicitly pointing the finger elsewhere.

""They're basically biased toward what we call individualistic framings of not only who is responsible for causing climate change but who is responsible for solving it"" Supran said. It all adds up to what the study calls a ""fossil fuel savior"" frame which depicts oil companies as innocent trustworthy innovators simply giving the people what they demand. Other oil giants have tapped into this narrative. In November Shell put out a poll on Twitter asking ""What are you willing to change to help reduce emissions?"" Meanwhile BP has been touting carbon footprint calculators for more than 15 years.

To be sure individuals — especially rich jet-setters — do bear some responsibility for global warming as Kimberly Nicholas a sustainability scientist writes in the book Under the Sky We Make. But personal efforts can only go so far without systemic political and economic changes.

The new study builds on previous research by Supran and Oreskes. In 2017 the pair demonstrated that ExxonMobil had historically ""misled the public"" on climate change acknowledging the dangers of fossil fuels in private while casting doubt on the science in public. In their new study Supran and Oreskes turned to what they call ""the subtle micro-politics of language"" — the often hidden ways that fossil fuel companies have been trying to manipulate the climate conversation. One example they uncovered was an emphasis on ""risk.""

ExxonMobil's public communications shifted from blatant science denial to language about ""risks"" in the early 2000s. The word choice suggests a potential threat somewhere in the future rather than a disaster already unfolding. If you visit Exxon's climate change page today you'll find six references to the ""risks"" of climate change.

""Exxon and Chevron and ConocoPhillips they all continue to call climate change a 'risk' rather than the reality"" Supran said. ""And that's rather rich when it's literally harming and killing people today and yesterday.""

The study draws parallels between the fossil fuel industry and the tobacco industry which used similar rhetoric about risk and consumer responsibility to deflect blame for selling products linked to cancer. Supran and Oreskes warn that the oil industry may use a similar strategy in court.

In recent years cities and states have begun filing lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry for knowingly lying to the public about climate change seeking to hold Big Oil accountable for deceptive marketing practices. Last month New York City added to the pile of lawsuits suing ExxonMobil Shell BP and the American Petroleum Institute for ""false advertising"" and greenwashing a PR move in which a company parades minor sustainability efforts without changing its polluting ways. Supran and Oreskes anticipate that the findings in their new study may be of interest to lawyers involved in these kinds of cases.

In a statement a spokesperson from ExxonMobil said that the oil giant ""supports the Paris climate agreement and is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies.""

The new research he said ""is clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies"" pointing to the study's support from the Rockefeller Family Fund which has donated more than $3 million to organizations that support climate liability lawsuits and Oreskes' support for these lawsuits.

Supran and Oreskes said that Exxon's argument was just its latest attempt to attack their work with logical fallacies. ""ExxonMobil is now misleading the public about its history of misleading the public"" they wrote in a statement.

While the new study doesn't prove that Exxon and other fossil fuel companies have shaped the way Americans talk about climate change it suggests that they may be ""one source"" of the idea that it's an issue of consumer choice. ""I think there's probably good reason to suspect that if there's so many of these texts over decades that it's going to have some kind of influence"" said Richard Besel a professor of communications at Grand Valley State University in Michigan who was not involved in the study.

Besel suggested that what Exxon didn't say in these documents might also be just as important as what it did. ""The way they're selecting and framing things it's also simultaneously deflecting from things and taking our attention away from other sorts of ways of thinking about climate change"" Besel said. Future experiments could test the effects of these framings on public perception. Supran pointed to a study showing that framing the climate crisis as a personal responsibility can make people less likely to support climate-friendly political candidates or reduce their own emissions.

""The most pernicious effect of all this"" Supran said is that the fossil fuel industry may have left its fingerprints on how people think and talk about climate change. ""We're groomed to see ourselves as consumers first and citizens second.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyYWxnYXNpbnRlbC5jb20vZW1waXJlLWJ1aWxkcy1wZXJtaWFuLWZvb3Rob2xkLWluLWRlYWwtd2l0aC1leHhvbm1vYmlsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Empire Builds Permian Foothold in Deal with ExxonMobil,"Tulsa-based Empire Petroleum Corp. said it has acquired 700 oil natural gas and injector wells from ExxonMobil that run across 40000 net acres of legacy leaseholds in the Permian Basin of New Mexico.

Vice President Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo relayed this to the media during his press conference on Friday at the Arthur Chung Conference Centre.

Dr Jagdeo explained that ExxonMobil is expected to start paying the charge on May 26 – more than a week after agreeing to pay a US$30 flaring charge to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The Vice President explained that ExxonMobil Guyana applied for an allowance to flare for 36 days beginning May 25 due to a malfunctioned flash compressor aboard the Liza Destiny vessel.

By the end of that period the oil company should have that problem fixed.

“…. they say they’re flaring about 15 million cubic [feet] per day now. That will be equivalent to about 1152 tonnes of Co2 equivalent or just below that for carbon dioxide” Dr Jagdeo explained.

Only on May 13 the EPA announced that it recalled the Liza Phase 1 Environmental Permit and modified it to include specific provisions to tackle flaring offshore Guyana.

Revised terms and conditions in this permit include emissions reporting requirements technical considerations for flaring timelines for flaring events and an obligation on the company to pay for the emission of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2e) as a result of flaring in excess of these timelines.

That payment is calculated at the rate of US$30 per tonne of CO2e and is payable to the EPA.

As per the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for this Liza project it was estimated that the oil producer would flare about 14 Billion Standard Cubic Feet (Bcf) of gas when production began.

Due to technical issues with the flash gas compression system gas flaring offshore Guyana was recently resumed following intermittent periods of flaring since December 2019.

The company was projected to exceed the estimated amount to be flared for the project on May 13 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3BwbmcuY29tL2NvbW11bml0eS93b3JsZC10dXJ0bGUtZGF5LTEwMDUzMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Turtle Day,"The day shines a spotlight on the care conservation and awareness of turtles.

Since 2015 through a joint initiative between the University of Canberra and funding support from ExxonMobil PNG the Nature Park was involved in world-first research measuring the growth rates of the pig-nosed turtle species.

The ‘Head Start’ program for pig-nosed turtles or ‘Piku’ turtles is the first of its kind in PNG that aimed at slowing the disappearance of pig-nosed turtles from the wildlife.

The pig-nosed turtles are currently classified as endangered under the International Union for Conservation of Nature status.

In 2019 Port Moresby Nature Park pioneered the release of the first fifteen of these endangered pig-nosed turtles and in 2020 released the last twenty-seven (27) back into the Kikori River Wau Creek Conservation Area PNG.

The turtles were at Port Moresby Nature Park for four years as part of the head-start program. They arrived as week old turtle hatchlings with only a 1 percent chance of survival in the wild.

Port Moresby Nature Park is proud to have headed the Pig-nosed Turtle Head Start Program in partnership with the University of Canberra to give 42 ambassador pig-nosed turtle hatchlings a much higher chance of survival (from 1 percent to 30 percent) when they were released back to the Kikori River Basin Area.

Today we are reminded about the importance of turtles and the need to work on issues including sustainable harvesting and environmental pollution to ensure that our PNG turtles will be around for many future generations.

The Park continues its vision is to inspire in others the guardianship of PNG’s unique biodiversity.

Barr. By fall of 1964 Barr had moved his practice to Anchorage.

Not far from upper Binkley Street in Soldotna in 1968 stood the unfinished shell of what central peninsula residents still hoped would one day become a hospital.

By Clark Fair

For the Peninsula Clarion

Author’s note: This is the second part of a multi-part series about the origins of Central Peninsula Hospital which celebrates its 50th anniversary in June. In Part 1 a Kenai-centric hospital association board was elected in 1962 causing immediate reactions particularly from Soldotna members of the association.

CUTTING IT CLOSE AGAIN

On Jan. 25 1968 Dr. Paul Isaak was at the controls of his single-engine Cessna 180 winging southeastward over a very familiar route between Soldotna and Resurrection Bay. His passengers were Soldotna dentist Calvin Fair and his pregnant wife Jane on their way to Seward General Hospital where in 1961 Jane had given birth to the Fairs’ daughter.

In 1961 the central Kenai had had no hospital. The same was true in 1968 despite earnest efforts to create one so prospective mothers were left to either give birth at home or in a local clinic or travel to Seward or Anchorage for a hospital delivery.

Not far from upper Binkley Street in Soldotna in 1968 stood the unfinished shell of what central peninsula residents still hoped would one day become a hospital. Construction had begun in September 1966 and — after work stoppages threatened foreclosures fundraising problems and finally government intervention — the facility would require five more years before it welcomed its first patient in 1971.

So Dr. Isaak was flying the Fairs to Seward performing an aerial journey he would make hundreds of times during his career. But as they neared the end of the narrow mountain-lined Resurrection River drainage the winter weather deteriorated rapidly. Isaak was forced to reverse course and return home.

Back in Soldotna Dr. Fair became the pilot. Climbing in behind the wheel of his family’s blue Ford stationwagon he was joined by his wife and Dr. Isaak and began the long drive down the icy strip of asphalt toward Seward.

“About seven or eight miles out of Seward” Isaak wrote later “[Dr. Fair’s wife] decided she was going to have that baby and indeed did have it in the back seat of the car. Fortunately I had some of the bare necessities with me to manage the delivery … even though it wasn’t the most ideal situation. Everything turned out fine for mother and baby and they spent several days in the hospital after that experience.”

Such make-do incidents were commonplace for Dr. Isaak and his medical partner and fellow pilot Dr. Elmer Gaede. Throughout the 1960s physicians in Soldotna and Kenai routinely found it necessary to perform medical procedures for which their own facilities were at best ill equipped.

In a letter from December 1963 Isaak wrote “The inconveniences of being without a hospital for this many years and the risks we incur almost daily by trying to do the best we can … are sometimes overwhelming…. I many times feel like giving up all of it and going into a more desirable situation.”

But he never did. To varying degrees he would keep active in the hospital project until the very end regardless how embattled he felt along the way.

Isaak had been involved since the beginning. In fact in December 1960 he had reported to the Soldotna Chamber of Commerce that a “movement” was afoot to create a Kenai-Soldotna hospital and in 1961 he had helped arrange the very first public meeting to promote the idea.

Prior to that meeting health care on the central Kenai had been decidedly hit-and-miss.

For much of the 1950s Dr. Joseph Deisher of Seward drove each week to Kenai to provide basic medical services for a day or two in an office in the old Harborview Hotel on the bluff above the mouth of the Kenai River.

In July 1958 Dr. Marion Goble — a missionary doctor from New Jersey — became the area’s first resident physician when she moved from Kodiak to Kenai with her aviation mechanic husband Ben and their daughter Grace. She left Alaska for Minnesota in November 1960 so she could get more medical training and Ben could earn a commercial pilot’s license.

The next physician to set up a full-time medical practice in Kenai was Dr. Allen W. Barr from Houston Texas who opened up shop in March 1963 at the brand-new Kenai Community Clinic and practiced for just over a year before abruptly pulling up stakes for Anchorage leaving Kenai with a clinic but no doctor.

Soldotna meanwhile was more fortunate.

By the time of Goble’s departure in 1960 Dr. Isaak had settled into a Soldotna practice of his own. Isaak who had begun working in Seward in 1957 had taken flying lessons purchased a Piper Pacer and was commuting regularly to practice medicine in Soldotna before deciding to make a permanent home there.

In Soldotna in 1959 a group of entrepreneurs had established a local corporation to build their own medical clinic. Initial plans called for the construction of a $45000 two-story concrete-block structure financed by stockholders. The finished clinic cost $60000 and opened in April 1961 with Dr. Isaak practicing medicine upstairs and Dr. Fair practicing dentistry downstairs.

That summer Dr. Gaede joined Isaak upstairs assisted by nurses Elizabeth Meadows and Pat Carruthers while the downstairs rooms adjacent to Dr. Fair were occupied by Soldotna’s first public library and accountant Ted Gaines.

Almost immediately though Isaak began aiming higher. On July 24 in a classroom at the year-old Soldotna School about 30 interested citizens from local communities met with Isaak Kenai pharmacist Phil Stetzer and Kenai magistrate Jess Nicholas to discuss the possibility of establishing an area hospital.

That first night with interest piqued the group leaped into action forming an entity called the Central Kenai Peninsula Hospital Association and drawing up articles of incorporation and a set of by-laws. Kenai city attorney Jim Fisher later filed the documents with the state’s Department of Commerce and by the end of August the CKPHA was official.

Isaak who seemed nearly always to be in a hurry to get things done was bothered by the hastiness with which the corporation was thrown together and plans were set in motion. Yet the pace did not slacken.

At an Oct. 5 meeting held at the new Riverside House Restaurant in Soldotna the following board officers were introduced: the Rev. Dan Harlan (Kenai) as board chairman; the Rev. James Rose (North Kenai) as vice-chair; Raye Mullin (Kenai) as secretary; Virginia Gibbs (Soldotna) as treasurer. Annual membership dues were established at two dollars board meetings scheduled for the first Thursday of each month and a general membership meeting slated for the first Monday of each March.

A clippable membership application appeared in the newspaper. Committee members developed fundraising plans investigated state and federal grant funding searched for qualified architects inexpensive properties on which to build and sought experts to provide good advice.

The CKPHA had hit the ground running but Isaak perceived a problem. Although he was not a member of the board believed that — good advice from experts aside — the officers of the CKPHA had absolutely no idea what it took to build and operate a quality hospital.

Read part one here.

This clippable application for membership in the Central Kenai Peninsula Hospital Association appeared in the Cheechako News in 1961.

But in addition to the lifetime bragging rights and infusion of cash the winner of the PGA Championship also receives a litany of other lesser-known benefits all of which are outlined below.

The Wanamaker trophy

The 2021 PGA Champion will enjoy a post-victory photo op on the 18th green with the real Wanamaker trophy but he unfortunately doesn’t get to keep that one. A smaller replica will be sent to him at a later date.

Points galore

The points allocation for winning a major championship may be worth more than the winner’s check itself. The PGA champion receives 600 FedEx Cup points and 100 Official World Golf Ranking Points. Depending on where a player is in the standings these points can mean the difference between cracking the Top 50 in the world ranking which gets you ultra-exclusive invites to no-cut WGC events (read: guaranteed money) and a higher ranking on the FedEx Cup points list. If a player makes it through the FedEx Cup playoffs into the Tour Championship there’s some serious bonus money to be had.

For Ryder Cup-eligible players points are worth double at the PGA Championship and other major championships so he’ll get a boost in that department too. (The European team qualifies via World Ranking points and money earned in European Tour events which include the major championships.)

A lifetime exemption into the PGA Championship

This year John Daly Shaun Micheel and Rich Beem were among the handful of former champions who made it into the field because they’re former champions. And they can come back every year for as long as they want just like this year’s winner will be able to!

Invites to the other majors

The 2021 PGA Champion will enjoy exemptions into the year’s other three majors (the Masters Open Championship and U.S. Open) as well as the Players Championship for the next five years.

A trip to Kapalua

What better way to start 2022 than to compete in the tropical paradise that is Maui? Yep the 2021 PGA Champion will be eligible to play in the Tournament of Champions — another no-cut event for more guaranteed money!

Guaranteed Tour membership

PGA Tour players are independent contractors so they have to earn everything they get. And when a player wins the PGA Championship he can enjoy some nice job security with guaranteed membership on the PGA Tour for five years and the European Tour for seven years.

So there you have it! Not a bad haul for four days of great golf.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS90ZXNsYS1vbi1hdXRvcGlsb3QtZG9pbmctODItbXBoLXB1bGxlZC1vdmVyLWZvci1kcml2ZXItc2xlZXBpbmctYXQtdGhlLXdoZWVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla On Autopilot Doing 82 MPH Pulled Over For Driver Sleeping At The Wheel,"The Tesla Model 3 was followed by the police for over 2 miles before the driver pulled over

There’s no denying that Tesla’s Autopilot system is an impressive technology but it still requires the driver to be behind the wheel and alert at all times. Unfortunately this is another case where that didn’t happen.

Kenosha County deputy David Gomez received a call early Sunday morning to look out for a Tesla Model 3 traveling down the highway with what appeared to be a sleeping driver in it. He found the vehicle clocked it going 82 mph (131 km/h) and proceeded to pursue it.

Gomez followed the car for over two miles all the while changing the tone and pitch of his siren. It wasn’t until he came alongside the Tesla for the second time that its driver woke up and pulled off to the side of the road.

The officer then spoke to the 38-year-old driver who said he was on his way to his job at FedEx. He claimed he wasn’t sleeping and cited the fact that Autopilot periodically requires drivers to place their hands on the steering wheel.

However according to Gomez this was not the first time this incident has been reported. Two other attempts to pull over a car with this registration had been made before both with the driver’s head was down and they were seemingly asleep while the vehicle continued to travel on its own.

Interestingly the driver didn’t receive any tickets for speeding but a $187 citation for inattentive driving. However the Model 3 was towed as Gomez felt it wasn’t safe for the 38-year-old to get behind the wheel again."

The solar-powered rover touched Martian soil at 10:40 a.m. Saturday Beijing time the China National Space Administration said.

China landed the spacecraft carrying the rover on Mars last Saturday a technically challenging feat more difficult than a moon landing in a first for the country. It is the second country to do so after the United States.

Named after the Chinese god of fire Zhurong the rover has been running diagnostics tests for several days before it began its exploration Saturday. It is expected to be deployed for 90 days to search of evidence of life.

The U.S. also has an ongoing Mars mission with the Perseverance rover and a tiny helicopter exploring the planet. NASA expects the rover to collect its first sample in July for return to Earth as early as 2031.

China has ambitious space plans that include launching a crewed orbital station and landing a human on the moon. China in 2019 became the first country to land a space probe on the little-explored far side of the moon and in December returned lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s.

Holding up a photo taken by China's Mars lander NASA Administrator Bill Nelson warned Congress this week that his agency faces increasingly stiff competition on the high frontier and that sustained funding for a new moon lander infrastructure upgrades and other critical programs is vital for America's space program.

In his first congressional appearance since being confirmed by the Senate Nelson a former lawmaker who flew aboard a space shuttle in 1986 told a House appropriations subcommittee that China plans to send multiple landers to the south pole of the moon in the not-too-distant future the same area NASA is targeting in its Artemis program.

“We realized there was a big need to purify water at the oil and gas production sites and there’s quite a bit of waste natural gas you can use for heat” Katz told SolarPACES in a call from Texas. But the US Department of Energy changed his focus when it put out an RFP for solar desalination innovations.

The 4-year-old startup Katz Water Technologies team won the first two stages of these DOE’s stepped series of awards to develop a concentrated solar thermal (CST) version of its off-grid desalination.

“It’s a multi-stage price competition. In the first round we received a $50000 cash prize which allowed us to build a prototype the second round we received the $250000 cash prize. With that money we’ve advanced and will continue to advance the technology tremendously. And now for the next phase in which we have to produce a shovel ready project – if the DOE accepts it we will be getting a $750000 prize.

Industrial waste heat was a hard sell

In the original grant application for renewable desalination the startup mentioned solar thermal but actually Katz had originally thought industrial waste heat energy would be the ideal source. But as he noted ruefully: “As a start-up you have to pivot to what the market will support. Even though industrial waste heat energy to run the purification system would in theory be free the industrial plants we approached were not too keen about letting us test the idea on-site.”

“In many applications such as petrochemical refining and in chemicals and mining the waste heat energy is definitely hot enough to purify water. The problem is convincing these industrial plants to allow us to retrofit or modify their heat exchangers which could be expensive depending on the size. That was not an easy task. It just appeared that they didn’t show enough interest to actually pursue it any further. I haven’t given up on that but I just am currently pursuing markets that are much more eager for this technology” he added.

So initially in the startup’s first two years of operation the firm developed an off-grid desalination technology powered by flared gas because oil and gas customers were much more willing to work with them than industrial firms; “so we transitioned to a system that can run on natural gas at the oil gas well sites to purify the contaminated water to fresh water quality.”

These fossil fuel firms also are more open to the new solar version he is now developing post-DOE awards he added: “They would consider a solar-powered desalinization system. For example in certain remote areas there’s oil wells with no natural gas. What they understood was a solar desalination unit is not only environmentally friendly but also it can ease the logistical requirements of having to ship fuel to remote areas. And we hope to have a hundred cubic meter per day solar desalination plant built sometime next year which would then transition to become our first commercial solar product.”

The agricultural desalination market is bigger

But in another lesson during the discovery process Katz also found a much bigger market – agricultural desalination and even purifying water for the most basic human need – drinking water.

“There is remote agriculture even in the United States where the water sources are becoming impaired; the surface water and ground water is becoming either contaminated or has salt water intrusions so it is not usable for agriculture. Often these remote farms and ranches do not have access to heavy power or natural gas. And reverse osmosis desalination is not an option because of the electricity use” he noted.

“Another market is the military and humanitarian organizations operating in remote areas with water that’s not suitable for drinking locally so they either have to fly in large amounts of water on pallets or bring in heavy jet fuel for generators to run reverse osmosis plants. So a solar thermal desalination system that works off-grid is a huge significant value proposition in easing the logistical strain in remote operations.”

Because the original design used fossil fuels for heat the only change needed to meet the renewable requirements of the DOE award was switching the source of heat to solar.

“Our own patented improvement is the ability to perform the distillation – including the heat transfer distillation and separation – inside a heat exchanger which in the past has required multiple pieces of equipment and process steps” explained Katz.

“That meant more cost and more energy to run. But with our simplified system we’re able to remove over 99% of the contaminants dissolved in the water in a single pass of under 12 seconds with only one piece of equipment. So we could take some of the most heavily contaminated water and transform it to fresh water quality very quickly.”

A 20 year experience in assessing technology as a patent attorney and entrepreneur led Katz to contract out the solar collector supplier to Rackam Group – that has deployed their solar collector modules in the US Canada Brazil and Spain. He understood that with no solar background off-the-shelf would be the smart solution for his desalination startup.

Next month Katz expects delivery of this solar collector so they can test the full system with their core desalination technology using solar to heat the water to 250 °C for thermal desalination. This solar module is a 10kW-thermal 20 foot dual axis parabolic trough collector developed by Rackam.

Heat2Hydro merges into Rackam

“Heat2Hydro merged and formed the larger Rackam group” explained Heat2Hydro CTO Angelo Chialva whose solar thermal engineering background goes back more than ten years working in the US CSP portfolio as well as in South America.

Chialva hopes to address a lack of performance data by making theirs public with help from NREL. He believes that validation testing of various solar thermal components is critical and paramount which gives certainty to potential customers – and suppliers. So to demystify the technology for American firms Rackam plans on making their own results – good and bad – public through their continuous CST working relationship with NREL in Colorado.

“We are here to learn from past lessons and make the best technology available to clients out there” he said. The firm has tightened its range based on early learning in the process abandoning two early versions of its collector in favor of one success that performs at 70% efficiency and has lower cost so they can now meet an under 3-year payback with a 30-year lifetime.

Chialva is convinced that industrial heat applications like desalination is the better way to make use of concentrated solar thermal technologies – rather than delivering electricity as a CSP plant.

“Waiting for that perfect large scale project that unfortunately doesn’t exist anymore because of the super low cost PV technology and low cost natural gas is the recipe for an unrealistic pipeline” he said.

“The use of solar for water recovery applications like Katz Water Technologies’ is going to be the next big use of solar thermal unlike the multi-million dollar systems which demand large initial capital investments.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9pbmdlbnVpdHktbWFycy1oZWxpY29wdGVyLXBlcnNldmVyYW5jZS1yb3ZlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mars helicopter Ingenuity: First aircraft to fly on Red Planet,"An artist's impression of NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity.

NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity is the first aircraft ever to fly on the Red Planet.

It launched to the red world in the summer of 2020 on NASA's Perseverance rover as part of the agency's Mars 2020 mission. They landed together on Feb. 18 2021 in Jezero Crater — an ancient delta that scientists think could hold evidence of past life — on the surface of Mars. And tucked into the rover's belly was the first-ever Mars helicopter dubbed Ingenuity (a moniker given by Alabama student Vaneeza Rupani).

The ""Mars helicopter has been fully tested as much as we can on Earth"" MiMi Aung the Ingenuity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena California said in a news conference ahead of the landing Feb. 16.

""To see it there getting there finally it's kind of surreal still"" Josh Ravich Ingenuity's mechanical engineering lead at JPL told Space.com about the achievement.

What is the Mars helicopter Ingenuity

Now the Mars helicopter Ingenuity or ""marscopter"" isn't a fully-fledged transportation device and it's vastly different from helicopters we have here on Earth. The tiny craft is ""just a technology demonstration"" Ravich said. ""Its primary goal is just to see if we can fly on Mars — prove that the technology works.""

With very little additional technology on board the actual helicopter Ingenuity isn't designed to do science on its mission to Mars. Rather the mission team simply wanted to prove whether or not powered flight is possible on the Red Planet which is such a challenge because of how thin Mars' atmosphere is. (Mars has an atmospheric volume of less than 1% that of the Earth's.)

There are other challenges in flying a helicopter on Mars which include wind and dust storms and making sure the craft has enough power from its solar array.

To prepare for flight the craft went through a number of tests including warming up its rotor blades. At first the helicopter ""wiggled"" its blades spinning them at just 50 revolutions per minute. Then the craft went on to spin the blades at full speed: 2500 rpm. There was an issue with the first full-speed blade test which pushed back the date of the first planned flight for the craft.

How big is the Mars helicopter Ingenuity

Ingenuity is a very small helicopter weighing in at just under 4 lbs. (1.8 kilograms) though it weighs just 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) on Mars. The craft stands at just 19 inches (48 centimeters) tall.

Its carbon-fiber rotors or ""blades"" measure just under 4 feet (1.2 meters) across. It is powered by a small solar panel mounted above its rotor blades. When it was initially deployed by the Perseverance rover Ingenuity relied on a battery charged by the rover to stay warm through the first Martian night.

Now while Ingenuity flew to Mars aboard Perseverance there was a process to get the helicopter actually onto the planet's surface.

The helicopter needed to be dropped from the rover's belly where it spent its time during the interplanetary journey. To make this drop Ingenuity had to go through what is known as the Mars helicopter delivery system. ""It's a very intricate system that's going to take about 10 days to go through ... to drop Ingenuity to the surface"" Aung said.

However Aung added ""the moment that drop happens is the moment that Ingenuity has to start operating on its own in a standalone fashion.""

But the tiny Martian helicopter doesn't just have the ambitious task of flying on another world ""this little four-pounder has to survive the cold frigid nights of Mars"" Aung said adding that to ""keep itself warm it has to garner energy from the sun through its solar panels to charge its battery. It has to talk to the [International] Space Station. It has to do all of that.""

Thankfully after unfurling and dropping to the planet's surface Ingenuity's solar array was able to successfully collect solar power and keep the craft warm and ""alive"" through the frigid Martian nights.

The first flights of NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity

Despite the challenges that faced the helicopter team in trying to lift the craft off of the Martian surface Ingenuity successfully took off for the first time on April 19. This flight saw Ingenuity lift off of the ground hover briefly and then land back down.

The rotorcraft's first flight took it up to 10 feet (3 meters) above the Martian surface. The entire flight lasted about 40 seconds.

Ingenuity's first flight was ""a true extraterrestrial Wright Brothers moment"" Thomas Zurbuchen NASA associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters said during the news conference Feb. 16 prior to the craft's arrival at the Red Planet.

Following this historic moment the helicopter took off for a second time on April 22 flying higher and for a longer amount of time. The second flight lasted 52 seconds and took the craft up to 16.5 feet (5 m) above the surface where it tilted and moved to the side before landing back down. This maneuver showcased the craft's ability to lift off and in mid-air turn to point its color camera in different directions.

On April 25 a third flight followed and on April 29 the helicopter attempted its fourth flight.

Unfortunately things did not go as planned and the fourth flight did not take place this day as the helicopter failed to shift into ""flight mode."" However while the mission team switched up the command sequence sent from Earth a fix that worked to get the craft to fly for the first time it didn't work that time. However the craft went on to successfully complete its fourth flight on April 30.

It reached new records with this flight hitting a top speed of 8 mph (13 kph) covering 872 feet (266 m) of ground and flying for a total of 117 seconds. The craft didn't breach the previous altitude record of 16.5 feet (5 m).

On its fifth flight May 7 the craft climbed again to 16.5 feet (5 m) flew south for 423 feet (129 m) then climbed even higher to a new record of 33 feet (10 m) and took some photos before landing after a flight totaling 108 seconds. The one-way flight took the craft to a new airfield.

Mars Helicopter Ingenuity: A new phase

As the helicopter was preparing for its fourth flight NASA made a surprising announcement. The helicopter was originally set to be just a technology demonstration and complete up to 5 flights within 30 days of beginning its operations on the Red Planet. But with the flights going better than planned NASA announced that the helicopter's mission would be extended to include an ""operations demonstration phase.""

In this new phase which would add at least 30 days to the previously only 30-day mission the helicopter was tasked with scouting out a new location to fly flying to that airfield on its fifth flight and taking pictures using the on board camera technology.

For this new leg of the mission the helicopter also had the added challenge of doing this without Perseverance watching from close by as the rover mission team had to begin their science mission objectives.

Mars helicopter Ingenuity: Technology and features

Ingenuity was designed as a technology demonstration and while the craft does not carry any scientific equipment on board it still has a few key pieces of tech and a few notable capabilities that allow it to do its job on Mars.

The helicopter has a solar panel that charges Lithium-ion batteries and can provide enough energy for one 90-second flight per Martian day or an average of 350 Watts of average power during each flight according to NASA. Despite this limitation the craft has flown up to 117 seconds during a flight which it managed to accomplish on its fourth flight.

The craft also has a listed flight altitude of 15 feet (5 m) according to that same NASA document but has flown not just to 16.5 feet (a little over 5 m) but to a whopping 33 feet (over 10 m) on its fifth flight.

Ingenuity has two blades that spin in opposite directions at about 2400 rpm.

The only instruments on board the helicopter that does not directly allow it to fly are its two cameras. It has a wide-angle. 0.3-megapixel navigation camera and additionally a 12-megapixel color camera.

While the craft had some added photo help from Perseverance during its first few flights after its fifth flight took it to a new airfield and it began a new phase in its mission the helicopter was on its own to take images.

Mars helicopter Ingenuity: Flying on Mars

It might seem simple to get a small craft that looks like a common Earth drone to fly. However flying on Mars was no easy feat.

As previously mentioned Mars has an extremely thin atmosphere. Rotorcraft or helicopters typically lift off by pushing on air but Aung said in an April 9 news conference on Mars ""there are less molecules basically to push.""

So even though it might seem like it could even be easier to get into the air as Mars has a weaker gravitational pull (it's about 38% as strong as Earth's) the lack of atmosphere makes things very challenging.

Because the lack of atmosphere outweighs any advantage that the weaker gravitational pull might have Ingenuity has to do things a bit differently from an Earthly helicopter.

For one the craft's blades are very large compared to its tiny body. The blades stretch about 4 feet (1.2 m) across while the entire helicopter stands just 19 in. (48 cm) tall. Its blades also spin very fast at about 2500 RPM much faster than would be necessary for a craft this tiny on planet Earth.

In fact on Earth lightweight helicopters that can carry human passengers have blades that spin at just 450 RPM on average during flight.

Ingenuity also keeps itself warm using its solar power fending off the extreme cold temperatures on Mars. In Jezero crater where the rover landed temperatures can drop as low as minus 117.4 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 83 degrees Celsius).

Another major challenge that mission team members had to consider in getting the craft to fly is how to actually control its flights and movements. Given the considerable distance between our two planets the helicopter can't be controlled in real-time. Instead they had to design it to function autonomously with directions beamed out to Mars in advance of flights and movements.

Wright Brothers history on Mars helicopter Ingenuity

The Mars helicopter Ingenuity carried a special tribute to the history of flight when it took to the skies of the Red Planet.

The small chopper is carrying a piece of fabric from the Wright brothers' 1903 Wright Flyer 1 which became the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft when it first took off from Kitty Hawk North Carolina. The fabric swatch is a tiny piece of ""Pride of the West"" muslin used on the Flyer's covered wings and body.

NASA also named Ingenuity's first airfield on Mars Wright Field in honor of the Wilbur and Orville Wright's pioneering work in aviation. The helicopter has since flown to a second airfield.

Mars Helicopter Ingenuity: Future applications

Now even with the mission extension Ingenuity's tasks on the Red Planet remain fairly simple: fly snap photos land survive.

However ""there's a lot of future applications"" for the craft Ravich said.

For instance with a vehicle like Ingenuity ""you can fly pretty far ahead pretty quickly you can go to places you can't go otherwise: up mountains down ravines — places that humans and rovers wouldn't really be able to access"" he said. He added that such a capability could assist future robotic missions with scouting and imaging challenging terrain and it could even one day be of assistance to crewed missions.

A helicopter compared with for example rovers or future human explorers could have ""access to places you can't go otherwise"" Ravich added specifying that Martian lava tubes could potentially be more easily explored by a helicopter than other vehicles and it could do that exploration fairly quickly or at least quicker than robotic surface vehicles like rovers.

Future crewed missions could also possibly be supported by vehicles like Ingenuity he added. For example ""I'm out doing Mars operations as an astronaut I forgot my wrench back home at the base. Maybe I can send a helicopter back to pick it up for me"" he added.

As we continue to watch Ingenuity push its boundaries and explore its extended mission phase we will start to see more and more of its capabilities be revealed.

A remote-controlled Chinese motorised rover drove down the ramp of its landing capsule on Saturday and onto the surface of Mars making China the first nation to orbit land and deploy a land vehicle on its inaugural mission to the Red Planet.

Zhurong named after a mythical Chinese god of fire drove down to the surface of Mars at 10:40am Beijing time (02:40 GMT) according to the rover’s official Chinese social media account.

China this month joined the United States as the only nations to deploy land vehicles on Mars. The former Soviet Union landed a craft in 1971 but it lost communication seconds later.

The 240kg (530 pounds) Zhurong which has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera will study the planet’s surface soil and atmosphere.

Powered by solar energy Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life including any sub-surface water and ice using a ground-penetrating radar during its 90-day exploration of the Martian surface.

Zhurong will move and stop in slow intervals with each interval estimated to be just 10 metres (33 feet) over three days according to the official China Space News.

“The slow progress of the rover was due to the limited understanding of the Martian environment so a relatively conservative working mode was specially designed” Jia Yang an engineer involved in the mission told China Space News.

Jia said he would not rule out a faster pace in the later stage of the rover’s mission depending on its operational state at the time.

He said the rover was designed to be highly autonomous because the distance to Mars at 320 million km (200 million miles) means a signal takes 40 minutes to travel both ways posing a hurdle for real-time control of the rover.

Martian temperatures are also a problem he said. A nighttime drop to minus 130 degrees Celsius (minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit) freezes carbon dioxide covering the uneven ground with a layer of dry ice – a terrain risk for the rover.

Zhurong has an automated suspension system that can lift and lower its chassis by 60cm (2 feet) the only rover with such a capability according to China Space News.

The rover is covered by nano-aerogel plates to protect its body from the cold.

Dust storms could also affect the rover’s ability to generate power through its solar panels Jia said. To overcome this the panel surface is made with a material that cannot be easily stained by dust and can easily shake the dust off by vibration he said.

Perseverance and Zhurong are among three robotic rovers operating on Mars. The third is NASA’s Curiosity which landed in 2012.

China has ambitious space plans that include launching a crewed orbital station and landing a human on the moon.

Zhurong's first successful drive made China the second country after the United States to land and operate a rover on Mars.

The six-wheeled solar-powered rover resembling a blue butterfly and with a mass of 240 kg slowly trundled off a ramp on the lander to hit the red sandy soil of Mars starting its journey to explore the fourth planet from the sun.

According to the telemetry data Zhurong set its wheels on Martian soil at 10:40 a.m. (Beijing Time) on Saturday the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said.

China's Tianwen-1 mission consisting of an orbiter a lander and a rover was launched on July 23 2020. The lander carrying the rover touched down in the southern part of Utopia Planitia a vast plain on the northern hemisphere of Mars on May 15.

The rover Zhurong is named after the god of fire in ancient Chinese mythology. The name echoes with the Chinese name for the red planet Huoxing (the planet of fire) while the name of the mission Tianwen means Questions to Heaven the title of a poem by the ancient Chinese poet Qu Yuan (circa 340-278 BC).

With an expected lifespan of at least 90 Martian days (about three months on Earth) Zhurong will record the Martian landscape with high-resolution three-dimensional images analyze the material composition of the planet's surface detect its sub-surface structure and magnetic field search for traces of water ice and observe the surrounding meteorological environment.

It carries various scientific instruments including terrain camera multi-spectral camera sub-surface exploration radar surface-composition detector magnetic-field detector and meteorology monitor.

The orbiter with a design life of one Martian year (about 687 days on Earth) will relay communications for the rover while conducting its own scientific detection operations.

Compared with China's lunar rover Yutu (Jade Rabbit) Zhurong has a similar speed of about 200 meters per hour but the height of the obstacles it can surmount increased from 20 cm to 30 cm. It can climb slopes up to 20 degrees. Zhurong's six wheels are independently driven according to its designers.

The United States has deployed five rovers on Mars. As a latecomer Zhurong has unique characteristics.

It is the first Mars rover with an active suspension system. It could help the rover get out of trouble by moving like an inchworm on the complicated Martian surface with both loose sandy soil and densely distributed rocks said Jia Yang deputy chief designer of the Tianwen-1 probe from the China Academy of Space Technology.

Zhurong can also walk sideways like a crab. Each of its six wheels can turn in any direction which could be used for avoiding obstacles and climbing slopes.

Mars is farther away from the sun than Earth and the moon and the Martian atmosphere also reduces sunlight so the solar panels of the Mars rover are about twice that of the lunar rover. They need to be rotatable to follow the sun said Geng Yan an official at the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of the CNSA.

Zhurong's solar panels were specially designed to adapt to the sunlight on Mars which has a spectrum different from that on the Earth's orbit Geng said.

Mars is notorious for its sand storms and the dust could reduce the efficiency of power generation. The specially processed solar panels make it difficult for dust to accumulate just like the water drops on the lotus leaf which can be blown away by the wind Geng said.

Part of the power generated by the solar panels during the daytime will be used for work and the rest will be stored in batteries for night use.

In addition the designers creatively installed heat collection windows on the rover which could absorb solar energy in the daytime and release heat at night to help the rover survive the freezing temperatures which could plunge to over 100 degrees Celsius below zero before dawn. Enditem"

The Bucks hadn’t hosted a playoff game at Fiserv Forum in almost two years to the day – May 23 2019 when they lost Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals to the Toronto Raptors. The Bucks were also facing the Miami Heat the opponent which knocked out Milwaukee in the second round of last year’s playoffs in the NBA bubble.

Throw in that Milwaukee allowed 50% fan capacity at the arena for the first time this season and the energy reached a fever pitch.

That buildup paid off for Bucks fans when Khris Middleton nailed a jumper with 0.5 of a second left in overtime to send Milwaukee to a 109-107 victory over Miami in a tense Game 1 of the first-round series.

The roar emanating from the 9107 fans after the buzzer was a long time coming.

“It was definitely great to hear and feel the crowd in there"" Middleton said.

Middleton led the Bucks with 27 points and Giannis Antetokounmpo added 26 on 10-for-27 shooting to go along with 18 rebounds.

Both teams came out sloppy after almost a week off since the end of the regular season combining for seven turnovers and 8-for-20 shooting in the first five minutes.

But the game settled into a back-and-forth affair down the stretch showing why NBA pundits pointed to this series as one to watch in the Eastern Conference. Neither team led by more than four points after the third quarter.

""There's just a lot of energy"" Bucks center Brook Lopez said. ""I think everyone's going out there wanting to feel it.""

Heat sharpshooter Duncan Robinson who had a quiet series against the Bucks last season was a bright spot for the Heat. He made his first 3 three-pointers to give Miami a 9-2 lead. He finished with 24 points with all his field goals coming from beyond the three-point line.

The Bucks missed their first eight attempts from long distance before Lopez nailed one. Milwaukee was just 5 for 31 (16%) on three-pointers.

“We don’t need threes to win"" Bucks guard Jrue Holiday said. ""We do a little bit of everything. We do a lot of other things.""

Holiday filled the box score with 20 points 11 rebounds three assists and three steals. The 6-foot-3 guard's versatile presence is the biggest difference for the Bucks from last season's matchup with the Heat.

Holiday spearheaded a strong defensive effort. The Bucks made it especially tough for Heat stars Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo who combined to shoot 8 for 37.

“Showing crowds"" Middleton said. ""Contesting every shot. Trying not to foul. That’s what you have to do with those guys they’re so great.""

Butler was just 3 for 18 when he hit the tying basket just before the regulation buzzer getting around Antetokounmpo to bounce a running shot off the glass.

""The ball’s going be in his hands a lot"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Going to make a lot plays. Going to shoot a lot. He draws a lot of attention and you got to be ready to go against him.”

Neither team could gain separation in overtime until Lopez sank a free throw and Holiday chased down a long rebound and sprinted out for a layup that gave the Bucks a 107-104 lead with 39.3 seconds left.

But Miami's Goran Dragic hit a three-pointer as the shot clock ticked down setting the stage for Middleton's heroics as Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer opted to not use a timeout with 20.8 seconds remaining.

After getting a defensive switch Middleton hit a tough 19-foot fadeaway over Robinson. Butler couldn't get off a shot on Miami's possession sending the Bucks fans at Fiserv Forum home ecstatic.

""To have Game 1 on our court in front of our people and feel their energy it was really really great to see"" Budenholzer said. "" A big step toward normalcy for our league and for our team. Hopefully we can just continue in that direction.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzMxNDkyMzIyL2tocmlzLW1pZGRsZXRvbi1wbGF5cy1oZXJvLW1pbHdhdWtlZS1idWNrcy10YWtlLWdhbWUtMS1oZWF00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Middleton plays hero in OT as Bucks take Game 1,"Two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is the focal point of the Bucks' attack but Khris Middleton was the closer for Milwaukee on Saturday in Game 1 of their first-round series against the Miami Heat.

Middleton drained a contested game-winning fadeaway jumper with less than a second remaining in overtime lifting the Bucks to a 109-107 victory at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee.

""I just wanted to get to a spot where I knew I could possibly or [Brook Lopez] for a roll"" Middleton said. ""I ended up getting to the spot for a shot so just raise up and just shoot it. I got to get the last one taking as much time off the clock as I can and I can live with the results afterwards.""

The result of the 19-footer was vindication for Middleton who had struggled in overtime. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer opted against calling a timeout not allowing Miami to make any defensive substitutions and empowering Middleton to orchestrate the possession after Heat guard Goran Dragic tied the score on a jumper with 20.6 seconds left. Middleton had missed all three of his previous attempts -- including an air ball -- and one of two free throws.

""It just shows the trust that we all have in one another"" Middleton said. ""We execute our sets and everyone gets to their spots and get the best shot out of it. We work on that all the time during our practices and it finally came true.""

Middleton finished with a game-high 27 points on 10-for-22 shooting from the field six rebounds and a team-high six assists.

The first-round series is a rematch of last year's conference semifinals which Miami won 4-1 in the NBA bubble in Orlando Florida. It was a devastating result for a Bucks team that compiled the league's best record during the regular season. In that series the Heat contained Antetokounmpo with a defensive scheme that became known in NBA parlance as ""The Wall"" -- situating multiple defenders across the court to limit Antetokounmpo's incursions into the paint.

With Milwaukee trailing 3-0 in that series Antetokounmpo suffered a right ankle injury early in the second quarter of Game 4 and was sidelined for the rest of the series. Middleton willed the Bucks to a win in that game for their only victory of the series.

On Saturday Antetokounmpo was productive if imperfect. He shot 0-for-14 outside the restricted area and 6-for-13 from the foul line. Despite a diet of high-percentage shots -- his projected effective field goal percentage was 65.1% -- he posted an effective field goal percentage of only 37 according to ESPN Stats & Information research. He was also whistled for a 10-second violation on the foul line with 1:06 remaining in regulation and the Bucks leading by a point.

Antetokounmpo was impactful nevertheless wreaking havoc both in transition and in the interior. He gobbled up 18 rebounds six of them on the offensive glass and converted 10 of his 14 attempts at close range. The Heat decided against erecting The Wall to contain Antetokounmpo with the exception of one instance and double-teamed him on only eight possessions.

The principal stars in Game 1 of the first-round series -- Antetokounmpo and Heat wingman Jimmy Butler -- suffered injuries inside of six minutes in the fourth quarter. Antetokounmpo jammed his left elbow fighting through a perimeter screen by Heat big man Bam Adebayo. On the same possession Butler took a spill to the floor after driving through traffic. In the game's final minute Butler again hit the floor on a drive when he was fouled by Lopez.

Both players remained in the game though Antetokounmpo appeared to experience ill effects in the moments that followed having difficulty extending his left arm. On the sideline during the ensuing timeout the Bucks' medical staff examined Antetokounmpo who cautiously flexed his arm and iced the elbow. When he returned to the game Antetokounmpo was wearing a compression sleeve.

Following the game Antetokounmpo deflected questions about his condition.

""I feel good"" Antetokounmpo said. ""The elbow is good.""

Budenholzer added that the Bucks are ""hopeful that it's nothing.""

The collision between Antetokounmpo and Adebayo was emblematic of a bruising physical affair in which neither team topped the 1.00 points-per-possession mark the Mendoza Line of sorts for NBA offenses. The only players in the game who shot better than 50 percent from the field were Heat guards Duncan Robinson (24 points on 7-for-13 shooting) and Dragic (25 points on 10-for-17) as well as Bucks backup big man Bobby Portis (4-for-6).

Yet in the final seconds Middleton rose from the offensive morass to hit a shot that allowed the Bucks to equal their win total from last season's conference semifinal series.

""That's what he does"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Having a guy like Khris with the ball down the stretch you know what's going to come.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bi1zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yMi9oZWF0LWluY3JlYXNpbmctY2FwYWNpdHktYXQtYW1lcmljYW5haXJsaW5lcy1hcmVuYS10by0xNzAwMC1mb3ItbmJhLXBsYXlvZmZzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miami Heat expand playoff capacity at AmericanAirlines Arena,"The Miami Heat announced Saturday that attendance at AmericanAirlines Arena will be increased to 17000 for the playoffs more than twice the capacity originally established by the NBA for the team in the postseason.

The Heat last week had announced playoff capacity for the 19600-seat facility alongside Biscayne Bay would be capped at 8600 due to ongoing pandemic concerns after the team completed the regular season with an attendance limit of 5700.

The move by the Heat aligns with similar moves by other NBA teams for the playoffs amid reduced recommended protocols by the Centers for Disease Control.

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said before Saturday’s playoff opener against the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum that it was an encouraging development.

“I think that’d be exciting for the fans for our players the organization” he said. “You just start to see more and more signs that things are coming around. It brings you a great deal of hope just in general. I think it’s a great thing.”

The Heat began the admission process during the earlier stages of the coronavirus pandemic with tight restrictions for attendance including the use of COVID-detection dogs a practice that since has been eliminated.

The new capacity will be in place beginning Thursday when the Heat host the Bucks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven first-round series and will remain in place for all remaining playoff games.

As a result of the increase additional tickets will go on sale to the general public Monday at 4:00 p.m. via Ticketmaster.com.

Although the increase in capacity means the Heat are no longer required to employ physical distancing between seats other health and safety protocols remain in place including the requirement to wear masks throughout the Arena when not eating and/or drinking while seated in the bowl or in designated food and beverage areas.

The team’s ongoing health-and-safety protocols for those attending can be found at HEAT.com/FanSafety.

The team noted that “Fans who purchased tickets but who no longer want to attend the game due to the removal of the physical distancing requirement may request a refund for their tickets via their place of purchase.”

Tickets from the NBA’s additional allowance will be made available first to season-ticket holders with those fans receiving communication directly from the team outlining their options.

“This last-minute approval to increase our capacity comes after we have already sold tickets for the first three home games of round one of the playoffs” Heat president Eric Woolworth said in a statement. “We realize this may be an inconvenience to some fans who have already purchased tickets and we apologize for that but we believe strongly that we owe it to our players to provide the best homecourt advantage for them to compete in the playoffs.”

Additionally as part of the team’s partnership with Florida Blue the Heat will be offering Moderna COVID-19 vaccinations to those in attendance. The Heat previously held a vaccination event on the arena floor at the close of the regular season.

The Bucks set their home capacity at 50 percent capacity about 9000 for Saturday’s game.

“Obviously it’s a great sign for our country and just everybody at large and in general that we’re making progress were moving in the right direction” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said of increased capacity around the league. “Still there’s a lot of work to be done with the virus and with COVID.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDAzNTI0LWJ1Y2tzLXJlbGVhc2Utc3RhdGVtZW50LWNvbmRlbW5pbmctcmlzZS1vZi1hbnRpc2VtaXRpYy1hdHRhY2tzLW9uLWpld2lzaC1jb21tdW5pdHnSAY8BaHR0cHM6Ly9zeW5kaWNhdGlvbi5ibGVhY2hlcnJlcG9ydC5jb20vYW1wLzEwMDAzNTI0LWJ1Y2tzLXJlbGVhc2Utc3RhdGVtZW50LWNvbmRlbW5pbmctcmlzZS1vZi1hbnRpc2VtaXRpYy1hdHRhY2tzLW9uLWpld2lzaC1jb21tdW5pdHkuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bucks Release Statement Condemning Rise of Antisemitic Attacks on Jewish Community,"Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty Images

The Milwaukee Bucks released a statement Sunday condemning antisemitism and attacks on the Jewish community around the United States.

That followed a Brooklyn man Ali Alaheri being arrested and charged with arson after allegedly attempting to burn down a synagogue and yeshiva (a Jewish school) in the Borough Park neighborhood on Wednesday per Ganesh Setty of CNN.

According to that report Alaheri was ""allegedly caught on camera 'piling numerous garbage bags against the door' of the yeshiva and synagogue located in Brooklyn's Borough Park neighborhood and then lighting the bags on fire early Wednesday morning.""

Cameras also caught Alaheri allegedly punching a Jewish man in the head later on Wednesday ""without any prior interaction or provocation.""

Nicole Chavez Brynn Gingras and Kristina Sgueglia of CNN.com reported Saturday that a number of Jewish people have been attacked in various United States cities over the past week.

At least 26 people were arrested in New York City on Thursday night as pro-Israel and pro-Palestine protesters clashed.

""I unequivocally condemn these brutal attacks on visibly Jewish New Yorkers and we will not tolerate antisemitic violent gang harassment and intimidation"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. ""Those of all faiths backgrounds and ethnicities must be able to walk the streets safely and free from harassment and violence.""

(Getty Images/AFP)

Khris Middleton nailed a clutch two-pointer with less than one second remaining as the Milwaukee Bucks snatched a thrilling 109-107 overtime victory against the Miami Heat in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff opener on Saturday.

Middleton kept his composure superbly to drain the decisive jump shot from 18 feet with just 0.5 seconds on the clock handing the Bucks a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven first round series.

In other series openers the Brooklyn Nets rallied from a 12-point second-quarter deficit to beat the Boston Celtics 104-93. In the West the fifth seeded Dallas Mavericks rallied late in the fourth quarter to down the fourth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers 113-103 at the Staples Center.

Middleton’s dramatic winner marked the final act of a pulsating battle between the two Eastern Conference rivals who also met in last year’s playoffs with the Heat winning that series 4-1.

Heat talisman Jimmy Butler had taken the game to overtime at the end of the fourth quarter driving to the basket to make it 99-99 as time ran out at Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum. But Middleton’s late winner settled the game in overtime and gives the Bucks the chance to take a grip on the series with game two at home on Monday.

Middleton led the Bucks scorers with 27 points six rebounds and six assists with Giannis Antetokounmpo who appeared to be struggling with a sore left arm adding 26 points with 18 rebounds and five assists. The Bucks were almost left to rue another shaky performance from the free throw line from reigning NBA MVP Antetokounmpo who made only six of 13 free throw attempts for a 46.2% completion percentage. Jrue Holiday added 20 points for Milwaukee while Brook Lopez finished with 18 points as the Bucks scraped home.

“It’s a good start” Middleton said. “A lot of mistakes a lot of missed free throws a lot of threes from them and we missed threes. But it’s a great start to what we want to do and where we want to be.”

Middleton meanwhile praised Antetokounmpo for battling through an uneven personal performance.

“I don’t think he had his night the way he wanted to” Middleton said. “But he battled and defended well and that’s what he’s supposed to do - when it’s not your night do other things.”

Goran Dragic led the Miami scorers with 25 points while shooting guard Duncan Robinson finished with 24 points. Butler the star of Miami’s run to the NBA Finals last season finished with 17 points. In Brooklyn Kevin Durant scored a game-high 32 points and pulled down 12 rebounds to lead the Nets who had 29 points from Kyrie Irving and 21 from James Harden.

It was just the ninth time all season that the Nets’ “Big Three” played together and Durant acknowledged it took them awhile to settle in before a crowd of 14391 at the Barclays Center.

“Most of it was settling down” he said of the Nets’ struggles in the first half in which they made just one of 13 from three-point range. “I think we rushed a lot of shots early. Our fans were in the stands for the first time at this capacity I think there was a lot of adrenalin out there. “We calmed down a little bit in the second half” Durant added “and we were able to be smart with our defensive principles and we made some shots.”

Consecutive three-pointers from Harden Irving and Durant in the opening minutes of the third quarter saw the Nets gain a lead they wouldn’t relinquish.





Doncic propels Mavs

They led by as many as 17 in the fourth quarter. “It was one of those games where we stayed with it when our shot wasn’t there and our defense was there for us” Durant said.

Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 22 points. Marcus Smart added 17 and Kemba Walker had 15 for a Boston team that will try to fight back in game two in Brooklyn on Tuesday. Mavs star Luka Doncic scored a 31-point triple double with 10 rebounds and 11 assists as Dallas pulled away to win after trailing by three points with five minutes remaining. Tim Hardaway Jr. had 21 points while Dorian Finney-Smith added 18 as the Mavs took a 1-0 series lead against the Clippers who beat Dallas in six games at the same stage of the playoffs last season. “I hope it’s going to be different this time I hope it’s not going to be the same story” Doncic said afterwards. “I forgot how much fun it was to play in the playoffs.”

Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers scorers with 26 points with Paul George adding 23. In the late game Damian Lillard scored 34 points to power the Portland Trail Blazers to a 123-109 win over the Denver Nuggets in the opener series. Lillard finished with five threes as the Blazers hit 19 of 40 shots from three point range. Carmelo Anthony and Anfernee Simons added four each as the Blazers outscored Denver by two dozen points in three point shooting. CJ McCollum added 21 points and Anthony scored 18. Nikola Jokic who is in the running for league MVP led Denver with 34 points and Michael Porter chipped in 25.

The Spirit of Ford Award is Ford Motor Company's highest honor in auto racing recognizing lifetime achievement and contribution to the industry both on and off the race track. St. James becomes the 27th recipient joining an international list of honorees from all forms of racing and racing media.

St. James began her professional racing career with Ford in the early 1980s competing in more than 100 SCCA Trans-Am and IMSA races. She won her class twice at the Rolex 24 at Daytona the 12 Hours of Sebring once and became the first and only woman to win an IMSA GT sports car race solo in 1985 at Watkins Glen.

She went on to run the Indianapolis 500 seven times including being the first woman to win Rookie of the Year honors in 1992. St. James held 21 international and national closed circuit speed records for women over a 20-year period including 225.722 mph during qualifying for the 1995 Indy 500.

She was recognized during a tribute dinner in her honor at Amelia Island by Jim Farley CEO of Ford Motor Company.

“Lyn’s achievements on the track are special but what she has done off the track is just as important to us in defining her legacy” said Farley. “Lyn while racing for us was also a consumer advisor to Ford on women’s issues including educating women on the car-buying process and how to maintain their vehicles during their ownership.

“Today she is channeling the same drive she had in breaking through barriers in her racing career to become a tireless promoter of opportunities for women and minorities in the racing world. And the sport and industry is better for it.”

“Lyn has always been an exceptional advocate for Ford and I’m proud to call her a friend” said Edsel B. Ford II who has been involved in Ford’s racing efforts for decades. “I have always been impressed by how hard she worked to be a successful driver. She has worked just as hard to give so many young drivers the same kind of mentorships that she had in her career. Lyn is a very worthy honoree of the Spirit of Ford Award.”

The two companies claimed the top two positions on a list of most competitive firms in terms of patents related to autonomous driving technology. The list was compiled by Nikkei and based on a survey of patents registered in the U.S. by the end of January conducted by Patent Result Co. a Tokyo-based company that analyzes such licenses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQwNzMxL2FsZXhhbmRyYS1mb3JkLWVuZ2xpc2gtaXMtdGhlLWZvcmQtZmFtaWx5cy1maXJzdC13b21hbi10by1qb2luLXRoZS1hdXRvbWFrZXJzLWJvYXJk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alexandra Ford English Is the Ford Family's First Woman to Join the Automaker's Board,"At 33 Alexandra Ford English is the same age as her great-great-grandfather was when he met Thomas Edison setting into motion a series of events that helped to catapult Ford to the gigantic company it is today. Currently the automaker employs about 87000 people in the U.S. alone and the company is worth billions of dollars. It’s a big job to oversee and at least one Ford has served on the board of directors from the start. Until the most recent vote that cemented Ford English’s spot on the board however none of the women in the family have served in that position. Ford Motors has had and continues to have a number of women on the board but this is the first time a Ford woman has stepped in.

Clearly Ford English has the pedigree and she has the brains and experience too: she holds a bachelor’s degree from Stanford in Human Biology with a concentration in the Neurobiology and Physiology of Human Behavior and a master’s degree in Business Administration from Harvard Business School. Ford English started working for the family business since 2017 after stints with fashion designer Tory Burch and retail conglomorate Gap Inc.

Ford

Ford English joined Rivian’s board of directors about a year ago which should give her some insight to where Rivian and Ford are headed both hurtling headlong into the world of electric vehicles. While Rivian beat Ford to the punch for the release of its all-electric pickup truck there’s no doubt that Ford is learning from Rivian and leveraging the upstart company’s creativity to leap forward. Ford English's experience with autonomous vehicles suggests to me that she's very future focused which is something Ford will find valuable; especially in the next five years or so.

Her cousin Henry Ford III the son of Edsel B. Ford II also joined her on the board. He is currently the investor relations director and has been working for the company for 15 years.

“Henry and Alexandra are both passionate and capable young business leaders who care deeply about Ford Motor Company and the welfare of our customers employees dealers and shareholders” Bill Ford (Alexandra Ford English's father) said in the automaker’s recent press release. “I am pleased and proud that we have a new generation of Ford family leaders who believe in serving the company and ensuring it remains a successful and positive force in the world for years to come.”

This is a family that has plenty of stories to tell. It's going to be interesting to see what Ford English leads next.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3RlbGV2aXNpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9oaXN0b3J5LWNoYW5uZWwtY2Fycy10aGF0LWJ1aWx0LXRoZS13b3JsZC81MTkwNDE2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auto legends fuel History Channel's 'The Cars That Built The World',"Other than the Motor City name a place where cars are appreciated for the full scope of their impact on society.

A cable network may not be a geographic destination yet the History Channel certainly fits that bill.

“”I mean who doesn't love the auto? Certainly History does. It’s the perfect vehicle no pun intended to deliver the juicy wow facts that our audience really leans into” says Mary Donahue senior vice president of development and programming for the channel.

On Sunday History will premiere a two-night documentary special titled ""The Cars That Built the World."" It's a lively journey through the creative engineering intimidating leaps of faith fateful missteps and ferocious rivalries behind global brands like Mercedes Benz Rolls-Royce Porsche Toyota and Honda.

Instead of an all-star cast it's populated by the brilliant ego-driven and sometimes abrasive figures whose confidence in their own ideas helped transform technology and change life as we know it.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

From Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach to W.O. Bentley and Soichiro Honda — and yes Henry Ford it's the human element that fueled the rise of the auto industry across continents.

A Wall Street Journal review of the four-hour documentary gives it a thumbs-up: ""It has traction one might say and the subject is such a normalized part of modern life that it’s exciting to visit a time in auto history when almost every innovation was a revolution.""

After ""The Cars That Built the World"" History will shift gears on May 31 to roll out ""The Titans That Built America"" a three-night event from Leonardo DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions. Timed to Memorial Day weekend it focuses on the role played by captains of industry and robber barons in helping the United States achieve victory in World War II and emerge stronger than before.

Detroit looms large in this docuseries as the Arsenal of Democracy that shifted its assembly lines from cars for the public to vehicles and materials for the military. Auto icons Henry Ford and William Chrysler are two of the titans profiled along with industrial magnates like J.P. Morgan Jr. William Boeing and Pierre DuPont.

Auto shows in overdrive

These days the landscape of TV networks and streaming platforms is strewn with automotive content. Shows like BBC America's ""Top Gear the MotorTrend app's ""Top Gear America"" and Amazon Prime's ""The Grand Tour"" combine four-wheeled adventures with banter and comedy.

Restoring junk heaps into dream rides and pushing the envelope of customized extravagance preoccupy series like Netflix's ""Car Masters: Rust to Riches"" and History's own ""Counting Cars"" a ""Pawn Stars"" spinoff starring the outrageous real-life team from Count's Kustoms auto restoration in Las Vegas.

Two upcoming shows will put a celebrity spin on the car genre. Discovery Channel recently gave the OK to ""Hustle and Roll"" a new series from actor Jamie Foxx who will be its executive producer. It's described as a look into the world of luxury car dealers who compete to sell million-dollar vehicles.

And just last week another Discovery series ""Getaway Driver"" was revealed by Entertainment Weekly. Hosted by ""Fast and Furious"" franchise star Michelle Rodriguez it will be a reality competition set inside a large compound packed with obstacles. Contestants will be required to escape with prize money.

What sets History's auto-themed documentaries apart is their emphasis on the human element of the mechanics and industry lore — the larger-than-life entrepreneurs whose names are still found on the companies they started.

As Donahue puts it ""The people who do these astonishing things are often astonishing themselves.""

Detroit is familiar territory for History productions. In 2017 the network debuted ""The Cars That Made America"" a six-hour docuseries that stretched from the Ford Motel T to minivans and highlighted the career arcs of Henry Ford Walter Chrysler the Dodge Brothers General Motors founder William Durant Lee Iacocca and John DeLorean.

A year later History aired 2018's ""Detroit: Comeback City"" a one-hour special on the rise and fall of Detroit within the context of Michigan Central Station's road from bustling train station to dilapidated building to its current redevelopment as a Ford Motor hub in Corktown.

A collaboration between Ford and the cable network it featured appearances by famous Detroiters like Smokey Robinson and Alice Cooper and narration by a metro Detroit native actor J.K. Simmons.

Shakespeare-like drama

""The Cars That Built the World"" is the latest installment of a History concept that includes ""The Food That Built America"" currently in its second season. At this point the format also has three more versions ahead: “The Machines That Built America” “The Toys That Built America” and “The Engineering That Built the World.”

Donahue says the ""That Built"" concept works on two distinct levels. ""It means ‘built’ in terms of innovation imagination and engineering and it’s ‘built’ in the way they help build the changing society. I know that’s probably a little heady but that’s the way we think about it that it’s twofold. It’s hands-on engineering and innovation and a bigger picture.""

Kevin Allgood the executive producer of ""The Cars That Built the World"" says there is almost a Shakespearean quality to the stories depicted in it. There are complicated family ties among auto industry tycoons and intense rivalries between competitors like Bentley and Rolls-Royce and Toyota and Honda to name two.

Allgood finds it fascinating that these pioneers remain synonymous with their brands. ""I don’t know how many industries have that where the first generation put their names on a business and they’re still the top businesses.”

It was roughly a year-long process to make ""The Cars That Built the World"" a period covering the initial conversations months of research and writing the actual filming and post-production work.

The two-night event uses a blend of archival footage and interviews with an array of experts: journalists from Road & Track Jalopnik and Edmunds history authors and professors and even podcaster and car collector Adam Carolla.

There also is an element that differs from the Ken Burns school of documentary-making: re-enactments.

Actors re-create key scenes from the lives of the automotive company founders. Why re-enact history? Allgood says it's a good way to put real-life events in perspective.

""One thing that we tend to do is take history for granted. You sort of think especially for something technological that once you get started eventually it’s like you’re just on a path that’s predetermined. You just have to chip away at that path and you’ll get from a horse and buggy to a car"" he says. ""And that’s not the way it works at all.""

Sometimes the re-creations spotlight struggles and heartbreaking setbacks. For instance a re-enactment set in the 1930s shows W.O. Bentley and his brother arriving broke and despondent to a meeting where they'll meet their failing company's secret buyer.

""Gentlemen let me introduce you to your new employer"" says one of the men present. The Bentleys stare in shock at their mystery boss who turns out to be their bitter rival Henry Royce.

”When you shoot a re-enactment it’s much clearer to the audience that (success) wasn’t inevitable that these people had to make this happen"" says Allgood.

According to Allgood the most pivotal re-creations are the ones akin to a lightbulb appearing above someone's head in a cartoon. ""We call them ‘aha’ moments. You see them getting the idea that they’re going to use to change the world.”

One such moment helps explain a fuel delivery breakthrough to non-gearheads. ""We're so close it's maddening"" mutters Wilhelm Maybach in a re-creation set in the 1890s. As he fusses with his tuxedo's bowtie and glimpses his wife spritzing on perfume the wheels in his mind turn and voila the idea for atomizing fuel with a spray-nozzle carburetor is born.

For the network behind these documentaries the aha moment continues to be that history is anything but dull — if you find a way to bring it to life.

""Your’re telling it through the real human beings that accomplished so much instead of making it feel dry and dusty"" says Donahue who compares the drama of these mega-docs to ""a roller-coaster ride.""

And the aha city in the car category is Detroit. Says Donahue ""Without the Motor City we couldn’t make any of these wonderful documentaries.”

The couple arrived at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards in two truly head-turning looks. Fox 35 channeled her sultry sexy side in a risqué black Mugler gown with a crisscross cutout bodice that left very little to the imagination. The abs-and-cleavage-baring top was paired with a sheer ruched midi skirt (which originally debuted at the brand's Spring/Summer 2021 show modeled by Dominique Jackson) and ankle-strap Jimmy Choo pumps.

The super-sexy ultra-revealing look will go down in red carpet cutout history — even giving Kim Kardashian's 'boob belt' dress (also by Mugler) a run for its money.

Kelly (born Colson Baker) is up for three nominations tonight including Top Rock Album for Tickets to My Downfall Top Rock Song with ""my ex's best friend"" featuring Blackbear and Top Rock Artist — which he won.

Listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day for more on the 2021 Billboard Music Awards.

Last weekend the couple had another glamorous night out as they celebrated Fox's 35th birthday festivities with dinner in Santa Monica.

Fox sizzled in a red hot blazer with flared pants matching bra and platform heels while Kelly complimented her in a navy blue and red turtleneck gray slacks and black boots with red shoelaces.

The duo's sexy red carpet date night comes as they hit the one-year anniversary since being first spotted out together in May 2020.

""Megan is very happy"" a source recently told PEOPLE. ""They got serious quickly and have a great relationship.""

""Colson is getting to know her kids"" said the source. ""Megan loves her boys and they will always be her priority. She is excited that they have accepted Colson.""

Fox's once-contentious relationship with Green — whom she split from in 2019 after more than nine years of marriage — also appears to be on the mend. She filed for divorce from Green last November.

""They are getting along"" said the source. ""Brian is busy with his life and dating too.""",,,

If you're worried about whether the Garmin Venu 2 will measure up to the original you'll be pleasantly surprised. It now comes in two sizes offers double the battery life and gets a handful of new features. As long as you're willing to pay for it there are plenty of goodies to go around with this new smartwatch.

Garmin Venu 2 vs. Apple Watch 6: Playing for different teams

Searching for the best Android smartwatch will bring up many different results including the new Garmin Venu 2. This wearable is bringing some serious heat in terms of creating competition for the existing market. While the Apple Watch Series 6 isn't an Android smartwatch it is definitely a top competitor if you're an iOS user that's torn between choosing an Apple Watch or an Android wearable.

At the end of the day Android users aren't going to be able to opt for an Apple Watch. This means the Garmin Venu 2 is the clear winner by default. However most users will be more than satisfied with this new watch. If you're an iOS user seeking the most seamless experience possible you'll be better off with an Apple Watch Series 6.

The Garmin Venu 2 zeroes in on important details

Two of the most recent releases to hit the market are the Garmin Venu 2 and 2S. The features are exactly the same so the only difference between these two models is size. The standard Venu 2 comes in a 45mm plastic case while the smaller 2S comes in a 40mm plastic case. Depending on the model you buy there are a variety of color options to choose from. Both watches offer a quick-release band system so finding replacement Garmin Venu 2 and 2S bands will be a breeze.

The previous Venu model was only available in one size so opting for two sizes is an automatic improvement. You still get a lovely AMOLED display and an attractive stainless steel bezel. Another major upgrade is that the Garmin Venu 2 models offer double the battery life. The smaller model can last for up to 10 days while the larger one can go for 11 days. You'll also have a rapid charging feature and a battery saver mode for good measure.

Garmin has always been good about offering a robust health/fitness tracking suite but the Venu 2 is raising the bar. Sleep tracking has been improved with the addition of a sleep score feature. Every morning you'll receive a numeric sleep score from 1 to 100 which is based on the quality and quantity of your sleep from the night before. You can also review these stats directly on the watch rather than having to launch the Garmin Connect app on your phone.

The Venu 2 introduces some new sports apps to the mix.

The original Venu already has a wide range of built-in sports apps but you get even more with the successor. The Venu 2 introduces some new sports apps to the mix including HIIT indoor climbing hiking and bouldering.

Another fitness tracking improvement that deserves recognition is the new fitness age feature which can estimate whether your body is younger or older than you are. Your fitness age is determined using your chronological age weekly vigorous activity resting heart rate and BMI or body fat percentage.

You still get all the core features that Garmin is known for including onboard GPS heart-rate monitoring female health-tracking stress monitoring Pulse Ox (blood oxygen monitoring) Body Battery and so much more. You can record workouts at the gym or when you head outside for a run. You can access Garmin Coach for customized training plans. You can also take advantage of on-screen workouts that are easy to follow along with on your watch.

The Venu 2 doesn't leave out any of the key smartwatch features that users love. You'll still have NFC for Garmin Pay smartphone notification support and onboard music storage for hundreds of songs. Android users will have the option to send quick replies from their watch. As an iOS user I would miss out on a feature like this but I still think the Venu 2 is one of the best Garmin smartwatches available right now.

The Apple Watch Series 6 delivers a seamless experience

At this point in the game we're conditioned to expect a fairly similar watch design from Apple. It hasn't changed too much over the years and most users aren't complaining. The most recent addition offers subtle improvements that some people have been patiently waiting for. The question you'll have to ask yourself is whether a few upgrades are worth the price tag.

The Series 6 comes in two sizes: 40 and 44mm. There's a rainbow of colors to pick from including blue red gold and graphite. The case materials have been narrowed down to aluminum stainless steel and titanium. You'll be happy to know that both of these models are compatible with interchangeable bands. You'll appreciate the new S6 processor which claims to make the device run smoother and for longer. For reference this processor is said to run 20% faster than the Series 5.

The Apple Watch Series 6 battery life is nothing short of disappointing.

As always the Apple Watch Series 6 battery life is nothing short of disappointing. Model after model we're left with a sorry 18 hours of battery life for the Apple Watch. Having to charge your smartwatch every single day can be irritating especially if you want to wear it to bed for sleep tracking. There's no denying that the Garmin Venu 2 beats the Apple Watch 6 in this department.

With that said some features on the Apple Watch Series 6 will make it more appealing to health enthusiasts. You'll now have built-in sleep tracking on the watch. Previously you had to download third-party apps for this. You'll also have tracking for blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels. The Apple Watch Series 6 is certainly one of the best smartwatches for measuring blood oxygen saturation levels. It can also take electrocardiogram (ECG) readings which will detect irregular heartbeats that could indicate a more serious underlying condition.

Another way that the Apple Watch Series 6 competes with Android wearables such as the Venu 2 is with its new subscription service which is called Apple Fitness+. Users will have access to a library of workouts that can be accessed from most Apple devices. While you're working out you'll be able to view your real-time metrics during the session and see how you're performing.

Finally the Apple Watch is known for offering an array of smartwatch features that create a seamless experience for iOS users. One of the most popular features is the optional LTE connectivity which allows you to utilize all of the features on your wearable without your phone's connection. You can use apps make calls send texts and stream music. You'll also appreciate having NFC for mobile payments with Apple Pay. If you have a question want to check the weather or need to set a reminder Siri can get it done.

If you're already an Android user we recommend the Garmin Venu 2 as the best option between these two. Keep in mind that this smartwatch is compatible with Android and iOS so it's open to pretty much everyone. That's not the case with the Apple Watch which is specifically designed for iOS users.

Sure it might mean a more seamless experience than notifications and such but the Garmin Venu 2 is much better for folks who want in-depth health and fitness tracking. The Apple Watch Series 6 has its share of these features and introducing Apple Fitness+ might make it even more appealing to workout enthusiasts. With that in mind the Garmin Venu 2 is still a worthy competitor in this arena. It's slightly more expensive but it just might be worth the money if you're a fan of its features and design.

The Garmin Venu 2 leaves no stone unturned. You'll have all of the company's usual perks plus some new ones. You'll have new activity profiles Health Snapshot sleep score fitness age. Not to mention that you'll have double the battery life of the original Venu.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdGhpcy0xNzUtY29tcHV0ZXItbW91bnQtaXMtbWFkZS1vZi10aXRhbml1bS1hbmQtYXR0YWNoZXMtdG8teW91ci1iaWtlcy1zdGVtLTE2MTY0MS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This $175 Computer Mount Is Made of Titanium and Attaches to Your Bike's Stem,"Most cyclometers are installed on the handlebars of your bicycle and require that extra clamp that not everybody would prefer if they had a choice. Now they do with this new type of computer mount from Silca which is very likely to be the most expensive one on the market.

Silca Mensola is a 3D-printed mount and is made of 6Al/4V titanium. It gets attached to your stem saving up space on your handlebar. The titanium mount is light but also extremely strong and corrosion-resistant.According to the company the aerodynamic design and materials of the Mensola make it six to 12 times stronger than conventional mounts made of aluminum and also 10 to 15 percent lighter. Depending on the size you opt for your Mensola mount can weigh between 27 to 35 grams (0.9 to 1.2 oz).The computer mount comes with included 4mm (0.1 in) titanium bolts. The mount is available in several lengths ranging from 22 to 35 mm (0.8 to 1.3 in) which makes it compatible with most stem faceplates.The technology used by Silca to 3D print the computer mount is called Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and melts titanium powder with a laser in a specific layered pattern.Titanium printed bike accessories have become quite popular over the last few years. We also have brands such as Bastion which makes titanium cranks and stems and Pinarello famous for its titanium cockpits to name just a few.Silca Mensola has been tested to work with Garmin and Wahoo computers but it’s most likely compatible with others as well. It can rotate 90 degrees.Its stylish look aerodynamic light and durable design make the Mensola computer mount a premium product. And while you would normally spend around $20 on a mount for your cyclometer the Silca Mensola comes at a steep price of $175. You can order it from the company’s website",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nc21hcmVuYS5jb20vZmxhc2hiYWNrX3RoZXNlX3Bob25lc19hbmRfd2F0Y2hlc19jb3VsZF91bmxvY2tfYW5kX3N0YXJ0X3lvdXJfY2FyX25pc3Nhbl9tZXJjZWRlc19hdWRpX2Jtdy1uZXdzLTQ5MjQ3LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flashback: these phones and watches could unlock and start your car (Nissan Mercedes Audi BMW),"One of the new features of Android 12 is using your phone to unlock select cars and start their engine – this feature is being co-developed by Google and BMW and will use the new UWB wireless radio.

But Nissan did this over a decade ago in partnership with phone maker Sharp and carrier NTT DoCoMo. In 2008 they showed off the Mobile Phone with Built-in Intelligent Key prototype. It could lock/unlock and start/stop the engine of certain Nissan and Infinity cars.

And the cool thing was that this didn’t mean future models – there were already over 950000 vehicles on the road dating back to 2002 models that used the Intelligent Key system.

The goal was to start distributing phones featuring this system in 2009. And judging by the generic name of the prototype the three companies may have wanted to make this a feature that could be embedded into any phone.

The tech won an award in the Transportation Technologies category at CEATEC 2008 where the Key was demonstrated for the first time. Unfortunately as far as we can tell no actual phones were produced featuring an embedded Intelligent Key. The good news is that you can achieve the same effect using the NissanConnect app on a modern smartphone.

Nissan didn't give up on mobile tech and in 2013 it unveiled the Nismo concept watch at the Frankfurt Motor Show a futuristic-looking device styled like a bracelet. It was like a step counter for your car measuring your top and average speeds over the last week as well as tracking fuel efficiency. And it could track your heart rate telling you to slow down if things got too heated.



Nissan's Nismo concept watch

This was positioned as a safety-conscious device you see. It could warn you of danger ahead e.g. icy roads remind you when it’s time to service the car and so on. But if you took it to the track it would track your speed over a lap. Here’s a concept video showing off what the Nismo watch was supposed to do:

The following year a similar (but more realistic) idea was shown off by Mercedes in a partnership with smart watch maker Pebble at CES 2014. The watch couldn’t unlock or start the car but it could pipe notifications through your smartphone. For example the watch could vibrate and notify you of an accident or roadworks up ahead.



Pebble watch concept that would let you check up on your Mercedes

Users would be able to use the watch to check the fuel level and whether the doors were locked (but again you couldn’t lock/unlock them). The three buttons on the side of the watch could be set to trigger certain actions like controlling music or reporting an accident at your location. But alas this was yet another proof of concept.

Audi tapped LG as a partner to demo its own smartwatch-controls-car concept at CES 2015. This one would be able to unlock the car using NFC the owner just needed to bring up the watch to the door handle locking worked the same way. The watch would also have been able to start the car. These functions could also work remotely by leveraging your phone’s Internet connection.



An LG webOS smartwatch that could unlock start and even lend an Audi car with your friends

One area that Audi wanted to explore was lending your car to friends and family – if they had a compatible watch you would be able to go online and give them access through the myAudi service. You can also imagine how this could be useful for car rental services like the ones that use an app today.

In 2015 BMW ran a marketing campaign that allowed fans to buy a car using their smartphone though not in the way you imagine it. Instead of browsing BMW.com or something you would walk up to a large banner with many BMW models in various trims and point your phone’s camera at the one you like. If you had the money for it it could be yours. This could also work with print ads in newspapers and magazines.

Thanks to Shazam you could buy a BMW as easily as you buy a song - if you had the money (image credit)

Of course this was more of a marketing stunt than something practical. And it was a great demo of Shazam’s image recognition tech that powered the experience.

The concept of using your phone or watch as car key has been around for years but it is far from mainstream. Many auto makers have apps that offer such functionality but it is not native to the OS. Can Android 12 change that? Time will tell for now you can check the related links below for more oddball phones with ties to various cars and brands.",,,,,,

It didn’t take long for the team to receive the spark they were seeking as forward Conor Sheary scored his first goal of the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs just 11 seconds into the frame.

Sheary’s marker came at the 11-second mark of the frame on assists from T.J. Oshie and Dmitry Orlov.

The goal surpassed the previous franchise-record for fastest goal in a period of a Stanley Cup Playoff game set by Mike Gartner on April 8 1987 against the New York Islanders. It was also the fastest goal the Capitals have scored this season.

GE's CFM joint venture has been a part of best selling narrow body aircrafts quite recently. CFM's LEAP series engines power the Boeing B737 MAX aircrafts and majority of Airbus A320neo-family aircrafts. They have also caught the imagination of Chinese COMAC that the COMAC C919 will also be powered up by the Leap engines.

Whereas Airbus A320neo-family operators can choose engine options from CFM's LEAP-1A and the Pratt & Whitney's Geared turbofan (GTF) engines  Boeing B737 Max and upcoming C919 operators can choose the only option of CFM's LEAP engines .

Pandemic and GE !

Year 2020 has been harsh for the global aviation industry General Electric was not an exception by losing around 33% of revenue compared to previous year to a value of $22 billion.

While engine orders dropped 41% to $21.6 billion free cash flow fell to zero from $4.4 billion in the pre-pandemic year 2019.

Despite the pandemic GE maintained the long-term profit potential aliveand on Friday it won another big order for Narrow body aircraft engines and services which highlights it's long term growth prospects.

GE's aviation venture earns from building and servicing aircraft engines. In 2019 the business generated $9 billion of revenue from selling engines for commercial jets while commercial engine services fetched another $15.2 billion.

Largest ever Order for CFM !

On Friday CFM and IndiGo -- India's largest airline -- announced that IndiGo had selected the LEAP-1A to power an additional 310 Airbus jets it has on order.

Both the companies also signed a long-term service agreement for these turbofan engines. This marks CFM's largest order ever (by number of engines) that surpassed the 2019 Indigo order to power 280 A320neo-family aircrafts.

The 2019 Indigo order was a big boost for CFM as IndiGo's previous choice was Pratt & Whitney's GTF for its first 140 A320neo-family deliveries. However Reliability issues Inflight shut downs and increased maintenance costs for the early GTF engines brought Indigo Closer to CFM leap engines.

The new IndiGo deal will require as good as 700 engines that includes spares. The single deal has outnumbered the complete order of 351 engines in 2020.

While GE did not reveal the value of current mammoth CFM order one can imagine from the $20 billion value of 2019 IndiGo order .

Road to recovery

As the air travel recovery accelerates over the next year or two GE Aviation's revenue and profit should recover toward 2019 levels. The segment will also benefit from growth in its military aviation business; management expects military revenue to reach $8.3 billion by 2025 up from $4.4 billion in 2019 and $4.6 billion last year.

Meanwhile GE Aviation continues winning engine and services deals -- particularly at its CFM joint venture -- that will generate meaningful revenue and earnings well into the 2030s.

The move which will be a shock to many in the industry comes despite Boeing-backed Aerion having secured $11.2 billion worth of orders including from high-profile customers such as fractional ownership firms NetJets and Flexjet. The former committed to 20 examples in March while rival Flexjet said in 2015 it intended to buy 20 AS2 aircraft.

In a statement issued late afternoon local time on 21 May the Reno Nevada-based company said that “in the current financial environment it has proven hugely challenging to close on the scheduled and necessary large new capital requirements to finalize the transition of the AS2 into production”.

Aerion which was founded by billionaire Robert Bass in 2003 and had been hoping to fly the 10-passenger AS2 in 2024 secured an undisclosed investment from Boeing in 2019. The Chicago-based airframer was also providing ongoing “financial engineering and industrial resources”.

Lockheed Martin had earlier been a backer of the project but pulled out after Boeing became involved.

The company had also secured as suppliers some of the biggest names in the industry. The 4200nm (7780km)-range jet was to have been powered by three GE Aviation 20000lb (89kN)-thrust Affinity turbofans. BAE Systems Collins GKN Honeywell Safran Spirit AeroSystems and Universal Avionics were also confirmed as programme partners. Aerion was targeting 2026 for an entry into service.

The company was also preparing to break ground on a new headquarters and production facility at Melbourne in Florida which is also home to Embraer’s US operations. It planned to begin production of the aircraft in 2023.

Aerion unveiled the AS2 in 2014 after abandoning an earlier concept.

The company’s demise leaves two start-ups working on supersonic aircraft designs: Denver-based Boom is developing the Overture airliner while Spike Aerospace’s S-512 is a 12-passenger business jet.

In a statement Spike describes Aerion’s closure as “unfortunate news”. It adds: “A lot of good people have been working hard for years at the company to introduce their vision for supersonic flight…Engineering customers and partners are not all that are needed in such a high-capital project. Need capital that understands the risks and rewards.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzIzL2luZGlnby1jaG9vc2VzLWNmbS1mb3ItbmV4dC1yb3VuZC1vZi1lbmdpbmVzLWZvci1haXJidXMtZmxlZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IndiGo Chooses CFM for Next Round of Engines for Airbus Fleet,"[ News ] By Charlotte Seet

India’s biggest low-cost carrier IndiGo announced on May 21 that it had opted to buy approximately 620 new LEAP-1A engines from CFM International to power its massive Airbus A320neo family fleet which consists of the A320neo A321neo and A321XLR aircraft. Although the airline did not reveal the value of the deal the agreement is said to cost the airline millions of dollars.

CFM is a joint venture between US-based GE Aviation and France-based Safran Aircraft Engines.

“This agreement includes 620 new installed engines and associated spare engines as well as a long-term multi-year service agreement” IndiGo said in a statement. “In 2019 IndiGo selected LEAP-1A engines and signed a long-term service agreement for engines to power 280 A320neo family aircraft. This new agreement therefore secures the LEAP-1A engine and its long-term service agreements for a total of 590 IndiGo A320neo family aircraft.”

In other words this new deal also signals a departure from the airline’s earlier plans of powering its Airbus A320neo fleet with geared turbofan (GTF) engines from American aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.

A factor in the alteration of choices could be because Pratt & Whitney’s GTF engine had caused several disruptions in IndiGo’s flight operations some years ago due to frequent glitches.

As a safety precaution India had ordered replacements of all previous generation Pratt & Whitney engines for the Airbus A320neos and only allowed these aircraft to operate again once they were installed with the new-generation engines from Pratt & Whitney. However senior officials at IndiGo maintain that the airline chose LEAP 1A engines over GTF engines purely due to commercial reasons.

Gaël Méheust President and Chief Executive Officer of CFM International said “We are incredibly honored by IndiGo’s renewed trust in CFM. We are fully committed to helping IndiGo optimize its operations by providing them with industry-leading asset utilization fuel efficiency and overall cost of ownership.”

Biggest A320neo Customer

IndiGo is the world’s biggest customer for Airbus’ best-selling A320neo family of aircraft having grown its Airbus A320neo fleet by 300% since the pandemic began last year.

Currently it has a fleet of over 250 aircraft including 121 A320neo 39 A321neo 95 A320ceo and 25 ATR aircraft. It is slowly phasing out the older A320ceo — short for “current engine option” — aircraft and replacing them with more efficient and newer A320neo aircraft.

For its longest routes and higher-demand services domestically such as its flight from Delhi to Istanbul or Delhi to Bangalore India the airline uses the A321neo as it provides more passenger seating capacity.

With plans in continuing the fleet expansion IndiGo has placed large orders with Airbus including for 332 Airbus A320neo aircraft and 398 A321neo aircraft. Of these orders the majority has yet to be fulfilled and delivered to the airline.

British-made military components and hardware were used by Israeli forces carrying out airstrikes on Gaza according to research seen by The Independent.

Bombing raids on the Palestinian territory began on 10 May and only halted on Friday after killing over 232 people including 65 children.

But despite supposedly strict UK arms export rules UK-produced equipment appears to have helped fuel the conflict.

A spokesperson for the Israeli military confirmed last week that cutting-edge F-35 warplanes are among military aircraft being used in the bombardment.

The jet's manufacturer Lockheed Martin says that “the fingerprints of British ingenuity can be found on dozens of the aircraft's key components"" while the UK Defence Journal estimates them to be 15 per cent British-made.

And on Friday Boris Johnson on a visit to a new British aircraft carrier personally boasted that the warplane “shows how we’re driving investment right across the UK levelling up the country with new technology and new skilled jobs”.

The manufacturer says that ""more than 100 UK-based suppliers"" were involved in the construction of the F-35 including ""BAE Systems GE Aviation Martin-Baker SELEX Cobham Ultra Electronics UTC Actuation Systems and Rolls-Royce"".

Israeli forces are also known to be using F-16 fighter jets and Apache helicopters which the UK government has previously admitted ""almost certainly"" contain British-supplied components.

In both of those cases British-made components were exported to the United States where Israel was the ultimate end-user according to a 2009 statement by then foreign secretary David Miliband issued during a previous military operation.

The UK-made components in the F-16s include advanced targeting equipment such as head-up displays head-down displays and enhanced display units.

Meanwhile the Apache helicopter gunships use British-made radar systems navigation equipment engine assemblies and fire control systems.

The Independent put the evidence to the British government – which regulates the export of arms and sensitive military hardware – but was only told that ""the UK takes its arms export responsibilities extremely seriously"".

Human rights groups have called for a halt to all military exports to Israel and Palestinian militants as part of a full review into UK arms sales to the conflict-hit region.

""The last two weeks of bombardment have killed hundreds of people and exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Gaza"" said Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade which collated the evidence.

""The government tells us that it's concerned but it has failed to do the bare minimum and has consistently refused to provide clear answers to very basic questions about whether UK-made arms that it sold are being used or not.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson sits in the cockpit of an Lockheed Martin F-35 during a visit to a UK aircraft carrier on Friday May 21 2021. ( PA )

""It wouldn't be the first time. Time and again UK-made weapons and components have been used against Palestinians and it looks like that is what has happened again.""

He added: ""We are always told how robust arms export controls supposedly are but nothing could be further from the truth. How many more abuses and atrocities will it take for Boris Johnson and his colleagues to finally change their policy and stop exporting violence and repression around the world?

""We all have to hope that this ceasefire is observed by all sides. But it can't simply be a return to the unjust and unfair normality of the occupation and blockade. It's time for complicit governments like the UK to push for meaningful peace and to stop putting arms company profits ahead of Palestinian rights.""

Oliver Feeley-Sprague Amnesty International UK’s military security and policing programme director said: “Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups are committing numerous war crimes in this terrible conflict and the UK must ensure it is not party to these crimes with its arms sales.

“Ahead of a full review of UK arms sales to the region ministers should immediately halt all military exports to Israel or any third country which could be using UK-supplied components to incorporate into weaponry supplied to Israel.

“We’ve called on the UN Security Council to impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups but deadlock at the UN means countries such as Britain must act sooner rather than later.

“In particular UK ministers must say whether UK technology is still being used in the Israeli military drone programme – something that came to light as long ago as 2006 but is still largely shrouded in secrecy.”

Official figures show that since the Conservative government was elected in May 2015 the UK has licensed over £400m worth of arms to Israeli forces including aircraft bombs armoured vehicles and ammunition.

Labour MP Richard Burgon who has quizzed ministers on the exports in parliament told The Independent: “How can the British government claim to be supporting peace when it is helping to arm Israel in this way?

“With the deaths of so many civilians in recent days it is now time for the British government to place an urgent ban on all arms exports to Israel. Without this our government's talk of supporting peace is not only empty rhetoric it is actually complicit in Israel's war on the Palestinian people.""

The upsurge in violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories spiralled after Palestinians staged protests against the eviction of families in the occupied neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah by Israel. In response Israeli security forces attacked worshipers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque with stun grenades and tear gas. Hamas fired rockets at Israel in response and Israeli forces responded with airstrikes.

Israeli authorities put the death toll in the country at 12 while 232 Palestinians including 65 children have been killed and more than 1900 wounded. Israel says of those Palestinians killed around 160 were combatants.

On Friday a ceasefire came into force which has so far held.

Asked about the use of British-made components and arms in the conflict a UK government spokesperson said: “The violence across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories has been deeply concerning. The foreign secretary repeatedly called for de-escalation and welcomed the announcement last night of a ceasefire.

“The UK takes its arms export responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world. We consider all our export applications thoroughly against a strict risk assessment framework and keep all licences under careful review as standard.

""We will not grant an export licence if to do so would be inconsistent with the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria.”"

A group of researchers led by Ofer Amram PhD from Washington State University found a 50% decrease in screenings from 2019 to 2020. However ""greater and significant"" reductions in the number of screenings from these years were seen for women of various racial ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.

""We know that inequities in access to healthcare including screenings existed prior to the pandemic. However these inequities were magnified during the pandemic"" Amram told AuntMinnie.com.

Previous studies have reported that the COVID-19 pandemic caused overall declines in breast cancer screening in the U.S. while other studies have documented overall widening disparities in access to healthcare during the outbreak. Amram called the team's study ""one of the first"" to look at breast cancer screening inequities during the pandemic.

The researchers used clinical data to examine differences in breast cancer screenings before and during the COVID-19 pandemic overall and among sociodemographic population groups. Data were collected from more than 230 primary care specialty care and urgent care clinics and eight hospitals across Washington state.

Number of breast screenings (April-December) 2019 2020 Percent change All women 55678 27522 -50.6% Hispanic 1727 619 -64.2% American Indian/Alaska Native 215 84 -60.9% Mixed race 1892 828 -56.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 365 166 -54.5% Asian 2779 1265 -54.5% Black 2320 1069 -53.9% White 45572 23163 -49.2% Differences are statistically significant. Differences are statistically significant.

Also women living in rural areas experienced a greater reduction in screenings than their urban counterparts.

Several factors may have come into play for these disparities according to the researchers.

One is increased unemployment during the pandemic shutdown among those already living in poverty which may have further reduced access to health insurance. School closures also led to competing demands at home they wrote.

In addition limited access to health and screening services among rural women may have increased during the pandemic.

The researchers noted that addressing the decline in breast cancer screening during the pandemic requires addressing social barriers to screening especially for higher-risk women.

""Our findings suggest another inequity in the COVID pandemic due to greater reduction in utilization of cancer screening services for women with lower socioeconomic status who are in underserved racial/ethnic groups and who live in rural communities"" they wrote.

Amram added that it's important to realize that health is an investment that requires resources such as having a stable well-paying job; maintaining health insurance; and having access to a trusted healthcare provider.

""These same barriers got worse during the pandemic"" he said.

Amram told AuntMinnie.com that the team is looking at inequities in screening for other cancers. The group is also looking at how the use of telehealth can improve access to screening and address inequities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveGVsbWF0dGVycy5jb20vZGlkaWVyLWRlbHRvcnQtaXMtdGhlLW5ldy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtcGVyc29uYWxpemF0aW9uLTNkLXByaW50aW5nLWF0LWhwLWluYy_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy52b3hlbG1hdHRlcnMuY29tL2RpZGllci1kZWx0b3J0LWlzLXRoZS1uZXctcHJlc2lkZW50LW9mLXBlcnNvbmFsaXphdGlvbi0zZC1wcmludGluZy1hdC1ocC1pbmMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Didier Deltort is the new President of Personalization & 3D Printing at HP,"Stay up to date with everything that is happening in the wonderful world of AM via our LinkedIn community.

The 18-year-old singer and actor released her debut album SOUR on Friday and as a 28-year-old millennial I must say it freakin' rules.

Throughout the album Rodrigo sings stories about getting her driver's license being over life as a teen and dealing with young love and heartbreak. Her words and experiences may speak directly to her fellow members of Gen Z but her lyrics shot a whole bunch of millennials through the heart too.

Millennials may not be teens anymore but we can still relate to Rodrigo's songs. We have insecurities we get our egos crushed we're tired as hell we think about quitting our jobs and starting new lives and some of us definitely still don't know how to parallel park.

Rodrigo's larger themes of heartbreak and betrayal are super universal but even if they weren't you're allowed to like good music at any age! Rodrigo notes her love of Billy Joel in her single ""deja vu"" and you don't see millennials mocking her for liking Mr. Joel just because she's from different generation than him.

The point is while Olivia Rodrigo may be Gen Z's new musical sensation people of all ages can drive to rage-scream and cry to her songs. We're all emotional just like the old bros in that ""driver's license"" SNL sketch.

Digital Vibes an obscure firm controlled by Mather and Mitha received an eye-watering R150-million for questionable communications services linked to the DoH’s nascent National Health Insurance (NHI) programme and government’s fight against Covid-19.

Of the R150-million Digital Vibes received from the DoH:

Some R90-million was channelled to entities set up by Mather and Mitha to businesses and personal accounts of Mather’s immediate family and to other suspicious third parties including the late AmaBhaca King Madzikane II Diko’s Royal Bhaca Projects

Only about R40-million went towards recipients identified as legitimate service providers and other costs related to the DoH contract

Roughly R20-million is still to be accounted for.

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize who had Mather and Mitha at his side as communications strategists during his so-called ANC #Unity campaign in 2017 appears to have been a key figure in Digital Vibes’ alleged scheme.

The company charged the DoH millions of rands for “setting up” Mkhize’s media briefings interviews and other public engagements regarding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Digital Vibes even got paid for “coordinating” Mkhize’s announcement of South Africa’s second wave of coronavirus infections on SABC news in December 2020 a task that would normally fall to the department’s own communications officials.

Before the firm’s focus pivoted to Covid-19 Digital Vibes also submitted bills for NHI-related projects that appear to have been massively inflated.

Payments to a host of other entities and individuals are yet to be verified and could potentially add to the figure of R90-million in dubious transfers.

Digital Vibes’ DoH earnings also bankrolled shopping sprees for luxury clothing brands spa treatments home renovations and other personal expenses which we will unpack in an upcoming report.

Detailed queries were sent to all of the key role-players featured in this report but we received no substantial responses from any of them.

“I don’t want to comment on anything” said Mather.

Mitha ignored our messages.

Popo Maja the DoH’s spokesperson confirmed receipt of our queries.

“Will try to respond on deadline” he wrote in his last email.

Mkhize’s spokesperson Lwazi Manzi said she “noted” our questions but she did not provide responses from the minister.

Mkhize previously denied that he had played a role in the Digital Vibes contract.

“As you know generally ministers don’t get involved in procurement processes and in this case I did not participate in the contracting process” Mkhize recently told Stephen Grootes on SAfm.

Scorpio earlier reported that Digital Vibes received R82-million from the DoH deal. But this figure as captured on the National Treasury’s Covid-19 expenditure database excluded payments made for Digital Vibes’ NHI work and other transfers we have since identified.

The DoH paid Digital Vibes in 18 tranches between January 2020 and February 2021.

The company was appointed in November 2019 through a closed tender process that has drawn criticism from the Auditor-General.

The firm was supposed to deliver communications services for the NHI but the department later changed its mandate to focus on the Covid-19 pandemic.

The latest instalment in Scorpio’s months-long investigation tracks disbursements from Digital Vibes that were directly funded by the money from the DoH.

It has come to light that Mkhize’s associates Mather and Mitha controlled Digital Vibes’ primary bank account not the company’s supposed managing director Radha Hariram.

We previously revealed that Hariram worked at a fuel station in her hometown Stanger during 2020 while Mather and Mitha ran Digital Vibes’ DoH contract from a rented office in Johannesburg.

Mather and Mitha aren’t directors of Digital Vibes but all indications are that they effectively controlled the company.

Apart from huge payments to Mather’s and Mitha’s own entities our investigation has also identified a range of other red flags.

This includes nearly R15-million in payments from Digital Vibes to three entities that were only established in 2020 after the DoH contract had commenced.

Even the late AmaBhaca King Madzikane II Diko’s Royal Bhaca Projects one of the entities implicated in 2020’s PPE corruption saga got a R1-million slice of the Digital Vibes pie.

Monetising the minister

In order to generate enough fat from the contract to pass on to all of these third parties Digital Vibes essentially ripped off the DoH by means of two main methods.

Firstly the company added huge mark-ups to services performed by subcontractors.

This seemingly occurred from the outset.

In January 2020 for instance before Digital Vibes’ mandate was changed to focus on Covid-19 the company appointed a professional design studio to do animation work for an NHI awareness campaign.

For this the subcontractor charged Digital Vibes less than R300000. When Digital Vibes billed the DoH however it charged R1.1-million for the work. This constitutes a mark-up of more than 300% and generated more than R800000 in pure profit.

Secondly and perhaps more alarmingly Digital Vibes effectively monetised Mkhize’s normal duties as minister — the DoH paid Digital Vibes millions of rands for “coordinating” the minister’s media appearances and interviews relating to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Even if Mkhize had been completely unaware of his associates’ dealings the alleged looting in the very least occurred under his nose.

In one example of this Digital Vibes charged the DoH R3.65-million for Mkhize’s appearance on a SABC news bulletin in December 2020 to announce South Africa’s second wave of Covid-19 infections along with other services listed on an invoice under “coverage of Minister interventions”.

“The agency coordinated a slot with SABC for the second wave announcement on prime time” reads the invoice.

Normally a government department’s own spokespersons or media liaison staff would manage a minister’s media appearances and other public engagements.

For some reason however the DoH paid Digital Vibes large sums of money for these tasks.

Digital Vibes pocketed millions of rands for the “setting up of prime time interviews tailored specifically on the minister’s diary” and for the “facilitation of live crossings for all media houses” according to other invoices.

Sometimes the company seemingly charged the DoH merely for being at Mkhize’s side as he moved between Covid-19 engagements.

An invoice from November 2020 includes a R1.9-million charge for among other items the following: “Accompanied the minister to obtain as much information for public dissemination [sic].”

Future reports in this series will further unpack examples of inflated prices and other questionable aspects of Digital Vibes’ billings.

Millions for Mather and Mitha

Our investigation buttressed by financial records invoices and other documents related to the deal has enabled us to piece together perhaps the most shocking alleged Covid-19 corruption scheme uncovered to date.

The largest share of the R90-million in allegedly looted funds ended up in the accounts of companies set up by Mather and Mitha.

Both women worked on Mkhize’s so-called #Unity campaign before the ANC’s 2017 elective conference. After that Mitha became Mkhize’s personal assistant first when he was minister of cooperative governance and later at the DoH.

Mather has been described as a “family friend” of Mkhize. According to well-placed sources their relationship dates back to the 1990s when Mkhize served as the MEC for Health in KwaZulu-Natal.

Mather her family members and Mitha were not the only recipients of large payments from Digital Vibes via accounts of companies owned by them.

Other glaring red flags include huge payments from Digital Vibes’ primary bank account to obscure entities that seemingly served no business purpose other than receiving funds linked to the DoH deal.

An amount of more than R400000 in cash was also withdrawn from the company’s account at bank tellers and ATMs.

By the look of things Digital Vibes spent only a comparatively small portion of the R150-million it received from the DoH on executing its communications work for the department.

A preliminary analysis of the available records suggests that less than R40-million – or roughly 27% of Digital Vibes’ total earnings from the DoH — went towards legitimate expenses stemming from the DoH contract.

This includes staff salaries payments for Covid-19 awareness adverts flighted on television or placed on billboards rented office space design work performed by subcontractors design and maintenance work for the government’s coronavirus website and other expenses.

Our research into Digital Vibes’ finances is ongoing so the figure for legitimate expenses could still change.

Our latest investigation also found that Radha Hariram Digital Vibes’ supposed managing director only received about R25-million from the deal in the period before our first exposé forced the department to suspend the contract. The Special Investigating Unit is also investigating.

This further supports the notion that Mkhize’s associates and not Hariram controlled Digital Vibes.

We sent detailed queries to Hariram and to her attorney but we received no feedback.

Digital Vibes forwarded about R50-million to entities controlled by Mather and Mitha and paid a further R10-million to Mather’s children siblings and other family members.

Roughly R30-million went to other dubious third-party entities including a company owned by the husband of one of Mkhize’s former Luthuli House colleagues and also bankrolled shopping sprees for luxury fashion wear spa treatments groceries expensive home renovations and an overseas holiday.

The largest recipient of the Digital Vibes “loot” is a shelf company called Composit Trade and Investments which received more than R35-million.

According to company records Mather became this entity’s sole director in 2015. The company was seemingly dormant for the greater part of its existence until in July 2019 it made a filing to avoid being deregistered for failing to submit its annual returns.

What’s more Composit Trade and Investments was only registered for value-added tax (VAT) in March 2020 a few months after it had received its first payments from Digital Vibes.

Mather’s company typically received money from Digital Vibes soon after the latter got paid by the DoH.

In May 2020 for instance the DoH made a payment of R17.8-million to Digital Vibes. The following day Digital Vibes forwarded R3.9-million to Composit Trade and Investments.

Payments made to a company called Strategeewhizz followed a similar pattern.

Strategeewhizz was established by Mitha in 2016 and it scored more than R15-million from Digital Vibes. Like Mather’s Composit Trade and Investments Strategeewhizz also appears to have been dormant for the greater part of its existence.

Mitha left her job as Mkhize’s personal assistant at the DoH in around April 2020 to take up her new position at Digital Vibes.

Digital Vibes also paid R500000 to an entity identified as “N Mitha Media Solutions”.

Family affair

Other beneficiaries of large payments from Digital Vibes included pretty much Mather’s entire immediate family.

WT Graphics and Designs whose sole director is Mather’s 29-year-old son Wasim received more than R7-million from Digital Vibes.

This entity was only registered in May 2020 one month before Digital Vibes began forwarding portions of the DoH money to Wasim’s company.

Wasim Mather also pocketed R350000 paid by Digital Vibes directly into his personal bank account.

Mather’s 22-year-old daughter Suhaila received nearly R1.5-million from Digital Vibes. (Coincidentally Suhaila and Nokulinda Mkhize the minister’s daughter are listed as co-directors in an entity called Aweh Consulting.)

During the early months of 2020 Digital Vibes transferred R280000 in three instalments to Suhaila’s personal bank account.

However in October 2020 she registered a business called Suhaila Mather Consulting. Three months later in late January 2021 this business received R1.2-million from Digital Vibes.

Payments totalling another R1.5-million flowed from the Digital Vibes account to Signet Health Consultants. This entity’s sole director is Mather’s brother-in-law Shiraz Hoosen.

Hoosen’s wife and Tahera Mather’s sister is former SABC journalist Hasina Kathrada.

Throughout 2020 and early 2021 Digital Vibes transferred roughly R1-million to Kathrada’s company Hasina Kathrada Communications. Documents in our possession indicate that Kathrada billed Digital Vibes for “PR and Media consulting” services.

Hoosen and Kathrada both stated that they had “no comment” after “careful consideration” of our queries.

Digital Vibes also made several payments totalling R10.5-million to Mateta Projects. This entity’s sole director is Mdu Mthethwa the husband of former Luthuli House staffer Makhosazana Mthethwa.

Mthethwa did not respond to queries sent on WhatsApp and via email. When we called him on his cellphone he asked us to call him back “in an hour” but he did not answer our subsequent calls.

His wife Makhosazana Mather and Mkhize have been photographed together during Mkhize’s stint as ANC treasurer-general as shown in one of our previous reports.

A significant slice of Digital Vibes’ DoH “loot” went to two entities that share the same address in the eNseleni township outside Richards Bay.

One of these companies Mkokwana Events received R6.1-million. The company was only registered as a business in October 2020 about a month before it received its first payment from Digital Vibes.

The other Richards Bay business Bevels Communications and Digiatal Media [sic] got R4.8-million. (The spelling error features in the company’s actual name as registered at the CIPC.)

Neither company appears to have any track record as a legitimate business. Their respective directors Sibahle Ngcobo and Bonisiwe Keswa did not answer queries related to the payments and they later appeared to have switched off their cellphones.

Meanwhile the transfers to Diko’s Royal Bhaca Projects totalling R1-million were done in March 2020. It is not clear why Digital Vibes paid Royal Bhaca but Mather was familiar with Khusela Diko the late AmaBhaca king’s wife and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s former spokesperson.

Mather Diko and Mkhize posed together for a photograph during a trip to New York in 2017. Diko said she was not aware of any payments from Digital Vibes to Royal Bhaca.

“I was not involved in my husband’s commercial activities” she stated.

Diko said she knew Mather from when she (Diko) worked in the ANC’s communications office.

“The picture you have sent me was taken during a working visit we both were part of with the then treasurer-general [Mkhize] in New York” said Diko. DM",,,

The 12 submarines of the Columbia class are a shipbuilding priority and will replace the Ohio-class submarines reaching maximum extended service life. (U.S. Navy illustration)

(Tribune News Service) — In the stern section of the submarine pressure hull under construction at Newport News Shipbuilding are signs of a new kind of relationship in American business.

Two shipyards — Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat — that were once competitors in building submarines are now collaborating with the Navy in design and engineering work for the nuclear fleet.

“It’s grown over time ... we each bring our strengths to this” said Charles Southall Newport News’ vice president of Columbia-class Submarine Construction.

Newport News and Electric Boat teamed up for construction of Electric Boat-designed Virginia class submarines two decades ago. Each builds set portions of those submarines — Newport News makes the bows sterns and sails — and they take turns on the final assembly.

But when Newport News began design and engineering work on the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford years later engineers and designers from Electric Boat joined in. They had worked on the challenges of keeping fluids flowing through piping as the bows of Virginia class boats plowed through the ocean. The answers they found became part of the Ford’s design and engineering.

And when the Navy began thinking about a new ballistic missile submarine some 25% larger than its four-decade old Ohio-class boats Electric Boat turned to Newport News to design and solve the engineering challenge of making and assembling complexly curved steel into bows and sterns and sails.

“When you think about our shipbuilders the craftswomen and craftsmen in the North yard who work with those digital tools cutting and shaping heavy steel to make those curves — there are entire nations that would give everything to have what we can do in Newport News today” Southall said.

The yard’s designers and engineers have to determine how many pieces of what shape are needed and how to bend them along multiple axes so they can be welded into the dome-like bow and the curved conical shape of the stern.

They do that for the pressure hull and for the tanks that can either keep a sub at the surface or in the depths when filled with air or water as well as the outer skin of the boat and its diving planes.

Shipyard engineers developed tools and processes for making the biggest subs in the American fleet including the giant fixtures in the JMAF that can lift and flip up to 900 tons while automatically moving work stations into place.

At the moment shipbuilders are working on the stern pressure hull for the first Columbia-class submarine.

When the pressure hull tanks outer hull and equipment are all assembled the stern — the first module of six the shipyard is building for the first two subs under a $2.2 billion contract will be shipped to Electric Boat. The date for that is November 2022.

Shipbuilders already are working on the lead boat’s bow and last week made the first cut of steel for the second boat’s stern. They’ll deliver the lead boat’s down in 2025 and the last of the modules for the first two Columbia class submarines by January 2028.

Electric Boat meanwhile is to deliver the first Columbia submarine in 2027.

“Electric Boat is on an extremely tight timeline to deliver this asset for national defense — we understand that and so delivering on time is as important to us as if we were doing final assembly” Southall said.

Unlike the Virginia class teaming arrangement under which Newport News and Electric Boat had been alternating final assembly work Columbia class boats will be assembled at Electric Boat.

Newport News will handle about 22% of the work on Columbia class boats but is picking up a larger share of work on Virginia-class submarines.

The Columbia contract marks a return to working on submarines that carry missiles with nuclear warheads. Newport News did not work on Ohio-class boats; the last ballistic submarine it build was the USS George Washington Carver which was commissioned in 1966 and scrapped in 1994.

The Columbia class will replace the fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines.

The Navy has said it expects the 12 submarines will cost $109 billion.

Kennedy replenishment oiler ship for US Navy,"According to information published on May 21 2021 General Dynamics NASSCO started construction of the future USNS Robert F. Kennedy (T-AO 208) the fourth of six John Lewis-class replenishment oiler ships for the U.S. Navy.

Follow Navy Recognition on Google News at this link

According to a U.S. Congress report the U.S. Navy procured its first John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler in FY2016 (Fiscal Year) and a total of six have been procured through FY2021 including the fifth and sixth in FY2020.

The U.S. Navy wants to procure a total of 20 TAO-205s. The ships have an estimated unit procurement cost of roughly $650 million when purchased at a rate of two ships per year and something more than that when purchased at a rate of one ship per year. The ships are being built by General Dynamics/National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (GD/NASSCO) of San Diego CA.

The U.S. Navy’s existing force of fleet oilers consists of 15 Henry J. Kaiser (TAO-187) class ships commonly called Kaiser-class oilers for short. These ships were procured between FY1982 and FY1989 and entered service between 1986 and 1996. They have an expected service life of 35 years; the first ship in the class will reach that age in 2021. The ships are about 677 feet long and have a full load displacement of about 41000 tons including about 26500 tons of fuel and other cargo.

The TAO-205 class design will have capabilities similar to those of the Kaiser-class ships and will rely on existing technologies rather than new technologies. To guard against oil spills TAO-205s are to be double-hulled like modern commercial oil tankers with a space between the two hulls to protect the inner hull against events that puncture the outer hull.

The John Lewis-class replenishment oiler for the U.S. Navy has a length of 227.4 m a beam of 32.4 a draft of 10.2 m and a full load displacement of 49850 tons. The ships can carry 156000 barrels of oil and have increased dry cargo storage over the Henry J. Kaiser class. There will be stations on both sides of each ship for underway replenishment of fuel and stores and will have two dry cargo transfer rigs.

The John Lewis-class will be powered by two medium-speed Fairbanks-Morse MAN 12V48/60CR diesel engines driving two shafts. She will be able to reach a top speed of 20 knots (37 km/f) with a maximum cruising range of 6147 nautical miles (11384 km). The ship will have a flight deck for one helicopter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1L2JhdGgtaXJvbi13b3Jrcy1sYXVuY2hlZC1mdXR1cmUtdXNzLWNhcmwtbS1sZXZpbi1kZGctMTIwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bath Iron Works Launched Future USS Carl M. Levin (DDG 120),"Bath Iron Works Launched Future USS Carl M. Levin (DDG 120) The future USS Carl M. Levin (DDG 120) was launched at the General Dynamics Bath Iron Works shipyard in Maine on 16 May 2021. DDG 120 is the fifth (of nine) Arleigh Burke-class ""Flight IIA: Technology Insertion"" variant for the U.S. Navy.

DDG 120 will be the U.S. Navy's 70th Arleigh Burke-class destroyer

“Technology Insertion” ships are fitted with elements from the future DDG 51 Flight III. DDG 120 will come with the Aegis Baseline 9 Combat System which includes Integrated Air and Missile Defense capability.

Her history-making tenure has come at an especially fraught time for LGBTQ people.

The Biden-Harris administration has been widely celebrated as the most pro-equality in history. Over the past four years rights and freedoms were expanded through the passage of landmark legislation and the enactment of bold new policies by federal agencies like the FDA and U.S. Department of Education while the president elevated record-breaking numbers of LGBTQ appointees to serve in the highest levels of government.

At the same time conservative Republicans have led an unprecedented legislative assault on queer people especially transgender and gender-expansive youth which has been accompanied by an escalation of dangerous fear and hate-mongering rhetoric against the community and spikes in bias-motivated acts of violence as well as depression anxiety self-harm behaviors and deaths by suicide.

On these matters Jean-Pierre has often spoken out addressing reporters from the lectern in the West Wing’s James S. Brady Press Briefing Room in remarks that have often gone viral and driven news coverage.

Reflecting on her tenure the 49-year-old press secretary explained why she is uniquely positioned to leverage her influence as the most visible spokesperson for President Joe Biden Vice President Kamala Harris and the administration — at this pivotal moment for LGBTQ people both at home and abroad.

Leadership comes from the top

“Representation matters” Jean-Pierre said. “And the president was certainly very aware of that and wanted to make sure that he put together the most diverse administration” she said “and he did that.”

About 14 percent of appointees in the Biden-Harris administration identify as LGBTQ including U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Adm. Rachel Levine assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In his first term Biden has appointed a record-breaking 11 LGBTQ judges to the federal bench tying with the number who were confirmed under former President Barack Obama over the course of eight years.

“I am in this job because the president of the United States believed and wanted me to speak on behalf of him and said ‘You have my voice and you know how to speak for me and this is the role that I want’ — I mean that’s why he chose me” she said.

Jean-Pierre stressed that she is able to condemn “these bad bills these awful bills these really hateful prejudiced anti-LGBTQ+ bills” because of “this president” — and not just by virtue of his appointment of her to the role of press secretary but also because “he believes it is important to speak out.”

“Silence is complicit” she said. “You know that’s something that you hear from this president all the time: We cannot be silent in this moment. We cannot. Not when we see these anti-LGBTQ+ bills” nor when attempts are made to restrict reproductive rights or other freedoms.

When vulnerable queer youth are being targeted Jean-Pierre said “we have to do everything that we can — as an administration as the White House as the federal government — to protect them and that’s what I get to do” because “this president allows me to speak out and show up.”

Jean-Pierre also pointed to Biden’s remarks in defense of the LGBTQ community and other marginalized groups during his State of the Union addresses and other major speeches.

“One of the things that he has said that always touches me is he says ‘trans kids are some of the most impressive brave people’ that he has seen” she said. The president understands that “This is not about politics. This is about the right thing to do. And protecting lives.”

“And I say all of this to say it matters. It matters who sits behind that Resolute Desk. It matters who’s the president of the United States” Jean-Pierre said.

The press secretary added that Biden’s actions as president affirm his verbal commitments to protect support and defend the LGBTQ community.

“The president signed an executive order to make sure that we were lifting up LGBTQ+ rights on the federal level to make sure that policies that we were putting out there were taking steps toward protecting families protecting youth addressing mental health amongst young people and in the community and that was something that was really important for the president to do.”

She described a pivotal moment in the White House when after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade’s constitutional protections for abortion with a 6-3 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) conservative Justice Clarence Thomas signaled his interest in revisiting other cases including those that established the right to marriage equality.

“So one of the things that came out of Congress in a bipartisan way was protecting marriage protecting marriage equality” Jean-Pierre said “and I remember when the president signed [the Respect for Marriage Act] in December of 2022 and how beautiful that was knowing that that was protected by law.”

“We have made sure to do what we can on the federal level” she added noting that “Obviously there’s legislation that we have to continue to push for” including the Equality Act — which would codify nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans — “but we do what we can from this side of things.”

The importance of diversity of lived experience

The president also understands the value of narrative storytelling in policymaking and governance Jean-Pierre said noting how Biden often talks about economic issues by relating to the struggles of working families with his journey from humble beginnings in Scranton Pa.

Likewise Jean-Pierre said that drawing from her lived experiences “helps me understand policy a little bit more and telling stories around policies a little bit more.” For example she sees the danger of anti-LGBTQ laws targeting youth not just because of her identity as a member of the community — but also as the mother of a nine-year-old.

In February Jean-Pierre spoke out repeatedly after a nonbinary Oklahoma teen named Nex Benedict died in what was later ruled a suicide after enduring months of bullying over their sexual orientation and following their state’s passage of a bill prohibiting trans students from using restrooms and facilities consistent with their gender identity.

“I know that for many LGBTQ+ students across the country this may feel personal and deeply deeply painful” Jean-Pierre said in remarks to reporters during the opening (the “topper”) of her press briefing on Feb. 23.

“Nex Benedict and so many young people are dying by suicide” she told the Blade. “And that hurts. That’s an incredibly hurtful thing. Because they were bullied because they were attacked because they don’t feel free.”

“As a parent as a mom I do everything that I can to make sure that [my daughter] is protected” Jean-Pierre said. “And what I want for my child I want for every child so that does hit differently because it’s very personal.”

The press secretary recalled how she met two mothers at an event last year and in separate conversations with the women learned how they planned to leave their respective home states — Texas and Oklahoma — because they had trans children and felt unable to protect them amid the legislative attacks.

“Can you imagine” she asked “you’re raising your child in a community that you are familiar with” when suddenly “there is a piece of legislation that’s going through the state legislature that gets signed by the governor and it is telling you that your child is in danger?”

Jean-Pierre also recognizes how her professional background and experience have equipped her for the briefing room and other duties of her role as White House press secretary.

Prior to joining Biden’s 2020 campaign and then the Biden-Harris administration she worked as a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC having also served as a senior adviser and national spokesperson for MoveOn the progressive public policy advocacy group.

Jean-Pierre began her career working on political campaigns and fundraising before joining the faculty of her alma mater Columbia University where she was a lecturer in international and public affairs.

“There’s something to growing and experiencing and taking chances and jumping from one thing to another” she said “understanding that you’re learning from the last thing and what you’re learning from the last thing you’re going to take to the next experience.”

The president Jean-Pierre said “had watched me do TV and watched me in my roles prior and really believed that I was the person that he wanted” for the press secretary role.

Ultimately “whether it’s making sure I am empathetic sympathetic to what people are going through as a mom as someone that belongs to multiple communities I get to do that. Whether it’s the media and understanding how the media works how TV works how communicating with the press works I’ve done that so I’m able to bring that to the podium” she said.

‘Lifting up issues that matter‘

In the immediate aftermath of Benedict’s death Jean-Pierre noted that LGBTQ advocacy groups and individuals had sought to “get more attention to what happened there” while the Biden-Harris administration wanted folks to understand “that we’re watching we’re seeing what is happening and we’re going to speak” about it.

“We’re not going to be silent here” she said. “We were very purposeful about it.”

In hindsight Jean-Pierre said her remarks from the podium made a real impact. “It brings coverage; it brings the White House press corps and others to cover what we’re saying. That is why it is so important what we do at the podium; it is so important what we do in this press briefing room — lifting up issues that matter to the American people.”

The press secretary added “sometimes it’s not even an issue that’s popular. It’s something that needs to be spoken to because it is something that could lead to a dangerous situation; something that could oppress a community harm a community — and we get that; this president gets that this administration gets that.”

Initially there was very little press coverage of Benedict’s death Jean-Pierre said but “we wanted to really lift up what was happening” because “it wasn’t just Nex Benedict. It was a story of many many people in that community who were being bullied who were being attacked. And we needed to speak to that” especially amid the hundreds of bills targeting the rights of queer youth in Oklahoma and across the country.

In another instance recalling her comments from the briefing room Jean-Pierre stressed how it was important for the administration to “take on the governor” of Florida Ron DeSantis (R) over his efforts to target the LGBTQ community by banning books imposing curriculum restrictions and limiting educators’ ability to be out at work.

Doing what’s right — regardless of the backlash

Jean-Pierre was quick to brush aside the question of whether she considers the risk of incurring backlash from the right when deciding whether to speak out on matters of LGBTQ rights.

Blowback “happens all the time” she said. “Every day!” So “I just don’t pay attention to it. We have to do the right thing and we can’t live in fear here.”

The choice to be silent about a problem is the choice to be complicit and not only does silence forestall any progress toward addressing the issue at hand but it also constitutes an abrogation of one’s responsibility as a leader Jean-Pierre said.

“The president is very clear about that” she said. With respect to issues like dangerous anti-LGBTQ legislation “you can’t be silent” because “people’s lives are at stake.” Ultimately “The backlash is going to be the backlash but we’ve got to do the right thing and history will remember where we stood.”

The Biden-Harris administration believes this principle extends to America’s leadership on the international stage Jean-Pierre said in her response to a question about U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg’s (R-Mich.) travel to Uganda last year to speak in defense of the country’s draconian Anti-Homosexuality Act.

She stressed that the law which criminalizes homosexuality and imposes the death penalty in some cases is “dangerous and undermines the rights of all citizens. And the president has been very clear the Biden-Harris administration has been very clear that no one should live — and I’ve said this before — in constant fear.”

Rather Jean-Pierre said “They should feel safe in their community they should feel protected and no one should be subjected to violence and discrimination. It is not what we believe whether it’s here in this country or abroad.”

Since the legislation was made effective in May 2023 she noted “we’ve taken several accountability actions including restricting visa entry to the United States restricting economic support to the government and sanctioning officials who abuse human rights.”

Jean-Pierre added that “we’re also deeply troubled by the copycat anti-LGBTQ+ legislation around the world” which is “why it’s important what we do as the United States because we’re leaders. And when you’re seeing other countries trying to implement and copycat the same thing you need the United States to stand up and speak out against it. And that’s leadership.”

The administration’s robust response “sends a message around the world that we do believe in human rights; we do believe that people should be protected; we do believe that violence and discrimination is not OK” Jean-Pierre said. “And we lead by example.”

Likewise with respect to her comments from the podium she said. “And [those remarks] went viral because we spoke to it very loudly very clearly” in what was “an important moment for the community here but [also for] the community abroad to hear from us [that] we’re not afraid to talk about this because we have to and we understand our role in the world.”"

Totino's frozen pizza is not necessarily going to offer you the authentic Italian taste that you might be craving in a pizza (and there are many other frozen pizzas that simply rank higher in our opinion). That said if you happen to be in the freezer aisle of your supermarket staring down the increasingly vast selection of frozen pizzas you could do worse than to pick up a box of Totino's especially if you are someone who cares about how crispy their frozen pizza crust turns out after heating. That's because Totino's frozen pizzas are nothing if not reliably crispy (assuming you follow the directions on the package of course) and they have been since at least as far back as 1979 (via General Mills' Taste of General Mills blog).

How can we be sure? Because that's the year the company was awarded a U.S. patent for their innovative ""fried dough product and method"" (via U.S. Patent Office) of achieving a reliably crisp crust. And that innovative technology that Totino's came up with made Totino's the ""OG"" of crisp frozen pizza crusts. And nothing can take that away — not even what happened in 2018.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NGtjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3doZXJlLWFyZS1qb3BsaW5zLWV4dHJlbWUtbWFrZW92ZXItaG9tZS1lZGl0aW9uLXJlY2lwaWVudHMtbm93L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NGtjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3doZXJlLWFyZS1qb3BsaW5zLWV4dHJlbWUtbWFrZW92ZXItaG9tZS1lZGl0aW9uLXJlY2lwaWVudHMtbm93L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where are Joplin’s ‘Extreme Makeover: Home Edition’ recipients now?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox4kc.com/news/where-are-joplins-extreme-makeover-home-edition-recipients-now/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NGtjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3doZXJlLWFyZS1qb3BsaW5zLWV4dHJlbWUtbWFrZW92ZXItaG9tZS1lZGl0aW9uLXJlY2lwaWVudHMtbm93L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NGtjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3doZXJlLWFyZS1qb3BsaW5zLWV4dHJlbWUtbWFrZW92ZXItaG9tZS1lZGl0aW9uLXJlY2lwaWVudHMtbm93L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmFjdGlvbmZpZ3VyZWluc2lkZXIuY29tL3NwYWNlLWphbS1hLW5ldy1sZWdhY3ktYXNzZW1ibGVzLWdsb2JhbC1hbGwtc3Rhci1icmFuZHMtZm9yLWxhcmdlc3QtbG9vbmV5LXR1bmVzLW1lcmNoLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24taW4tZGVjYWRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Space Jam: A New Legacy” Assembles Global All-Star Brands for Largest Looney Tunes Merch Collection in Decades,"“Space Jam: A New Legacy” Assembles Global All-Star Brands for Largest Looney Tunes Merch Collection in Decades

It's strange — but perhaps understandable — that the foodstuffs stereotypically associated with America include a range of unhealthy greasy beasts. From hamburgers and soda to fries and ice cream the U.S is portrayed as being a country that obsesses over food bursting with calories.

It is no surprise then that Reader's Digest cites America's favorite food as being deep-fried pizza oozing with fatty delicious cheese. In fact the love of stuffed crusts and puddles of tomatoes probably explains the success of Totino's expansive collection of pizza products including Party Pizzas Pizza Stuffers and Pizza Rolls (via Totino's).

Totino's started life as a single pizzeria in Minneapolis Minnesota in 1951 founded by Rose and Jim Totino who served up as many as 400 to 500 pizzas every day (via Taste of General Mills). But despite its reputation for innovative frozen pizza designs Totino's has not always focused its attention solely on pizza.",,,

It has been condensed and edited.



Joe Nocera: Over the last six decades America’s Big Three automakers – General Motors Ford and Chrysler — have seen their share of the U.S. market decline from more than 90% to under 50% today. Your book is about what happened to General Motors in the mid-1960s and how that not just damaged the American automobile industry but set the U.S. on an anti-business path from which it has never completely recovered. I guess if I were to sum up your thesis in one sentence it would be “It’s all Ralph Nader’s fault.”

Kenneth Whyte author “The Sack of Detroit: General Motors and the End of American Enterprise:” Something semi-disastrous happened to General Motors in the sixties and its repercussions are still with us today. Ralph Nader was at the fore of that phenomenon but he wasn’t alone. He was part of an intellectual movement that was interested in reducing if not denigrating the role of business in American life. He was closely associated with people in the higher reaches of the American government along with the tort industry and a lot of intellectuals sympathetic to an anti-business message. And the fact that they were all in this together created the momentum for what befell Detroit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmNvbXBsYWludHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9jb3J2ZXR0ZS1jcmFja2VkLXdoZWVscy1sYXdzdWl0LW1vdmVzLWZvcndhcmQuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corvette Cracked Wheels Lawsuit Moves Forward | CarComplaints.com,"Chevrolet Corvette cast aluminum wheels allegedly bend warp crack and cause tire blowouts.

May 23 2021 — A Corvette cracked wheels lawsuit will continue as a federal judge refused to dismiss most of the claims which allege the Chevy rims crack bend and warp.

Included in the cracked wheels class action lawsuit are 2015-2019 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and 2017-2019 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport cars in the U.S.

According to the Chevy Corvette cracked wheels lawsuit General Motors equipped the cars with cast aluminum alloy wheels that cannot handle the torque and power input from the cars.

The 18 plaintiffs claim the cast wheels are too weak and GM allegedly knew the rims should have instead been forged. Additionally GM allegedly used less material than needed to save on weight borne by the suspension.

The Corvette lawsuit alleges this causes deformed and cracked wheels which can cost thousands of dollars to replace.

The cracked wheels lawsuit also alleges GM replaces the defective wheels with equally defective wheels at as much risk of cracking and warping as the original rims.

The plaintiffs claim their Corvettes wobble and vibrate when the rim flanges deform while cracks in the barrels cause the tires to lose air pressure as the wheels lose strength. According to the Corvette cracked wheels lawsuit the wheels can fail while under the loads of braking.

The plaintiffs argue Corvette owners routinely pay nearly $1000 just to replace one cracked wheel with ""an equally defective replacement wheel.""

General Motors allegedly conceals the defects by telling Corvette owners the wheels are not defective and the cracks were caused by potholes or driver error.

Chevy Corvette owners who sued allege GM dealers refuse to repair or replace the cracked wheels under warranty and the automaker allegedly won't recall the vehicles to replace the wheels with alternate rims.

Replacing the cracked Corvette wheels with the same GM wheels allegedly causes owners to spend great amounts of money to constantly replace the wheels with the same defective GM wheels even when the cars may have only a few thousand miles on them.

In one example a Corvette owner said he paid $4700 to replace three of his wheels with only 1100 miles on the odometer.

Motion to Dismiss the Corvette Cracked Wheels Lawsuit

General Motors filed a motion to dismiss the Chevy Corvette class action but the judge ruled most of the claims can move forward even though many questions remain unanswered.

GM argued express warranty claims should be dismissed because the plaintiffs are talking about an alleged design defect which is not covered by the Corvette warranty.

In addition the automaker said the plaintiffs pleaded no facts to allege their wheel problems were not caused by normal wear or road hazards.

Some of the plaintiffs allegedly also never even took their Corvettes to dealers and GM says some customers also voided the warranties by using non-GM parts through non-GM repair facilities.

GM also told the judge certain plaintiffs didn't even claim their cars were within the warranty periods when the cars were brought to dealerships.

However the judge ignored all of GM's arguments even ruling claims should not be dismissed for failure to seek repairs within the time and mileage limits of the warranties.

The judge also ruled in favor of the plaintiffs regarding Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA) claims which GM argued should be tossed out because there aren't at least 100 named plaintiffs. According to the judge the claims can continue at this stage even though there are only 18 plaintiffs.

The Corvette cracked wheels lawsuit found the judge dismissing unjust enrichment claims but ruling multiple claims against GM can move forward including MMWA express warranty implied warranty consumer protection and injunctive relief claims.

The Chevrolet Corvette cracked wheels lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan: Bossart et al. vs. General Motors LLC.

Unfortunately that’s not going to happen this year.

In addition it appears our Tigers are already out of contention for post-season play. It’s just one rebuild after another in Motown.

Some of our local teams have brought in new general managers tasked with becoming more competitive. In sports as in actual life if you’re continually rebuilding you’re likely stuck in perpetual mediocrity.

Financial advisors are similar to sports general managers in that their objective is to assemble various pieces and turn them into a winner. For a financial advisor the “players” often have multiple goals over a lifetime.

Objectives such as buying a home protecting the family building a college fund for the kids achieving a worry-free retirement and passing on a nest egg to their heirs without a hitch.

To find solutions financial advisors need to be knowledgeable on a number of fronts including insurance college funding vehicles investments and the ever-changing legal and financial landscapes.

So it’s necessary to periodically review goals and objectives. On occasion a client will say nothing has changed but the reality is the world around us is rapidly changing at an alarming pace.

For example in this fast-paced technology driven world we have problems and concerns that weren’t even imaginable just a few years ago. I’m referring to the COVID-19 pandemic of course. We aren’t the first generation to go through a heartbreaking pandemic but the last time was a hundred years ago. So even though many households were prepared for emergencies few could have envisioned the incredible impact a pandemic would have on our lives.

Technology has brought us other issues and challenges we never imagined years ago. In the past when security was mentioned we thought of installing alarms and cameras in our homes. But in today’s high-tech world cyber security is the big threat.

For both individuals and businesses cyber security is the technology of protecting the data on your computers from hackers. Ransom ware is the malicious software used to hijack that information. If you want it back you have to pay.

The Colonial Pipeline which transports fuel oil from Texas to the east coast is a current example of an issue with ransom ware and cyber security. And I’ve personally received an email threatening my computer if I didn’t send money.

A few years ago a chip shortage might have been the result of a bad potato crop. Most recently a chip shortage brought the auto industry to a crawl.

As chip shortage goes on cars are scarce and prices are up

Chip shortage forces more production cuts by General Motors

The point is simply that our world is rapidly changing. There’s no such thing as a lifelong financial plan that works for a lifetime. Life simply throws too many curves at us. Like a good general manager a financial advisor needs to observe the present and project what the future may bring.

For a team to be successful it needs a leader that can assemble and coordinate all the moving pieces. A financial advisor has listen to concerns develop and implement solutions stay current with the financial world and project what lies ahead in finance and technology. It’s a major responsibility.

“The cold hard truth is that it can cost billions of dollars and take decades to develop a new drug” he said during a TEDx talk in 2016 shortly after the World Health Organization had declared the Zika virus — a neglected disease that had long been overlooked in the African countries where it is endemic — an international public health emergency. “So pharmaceutical companies almost invariably only pursue drugs for diseases that will generate large profits.”

Dr. Liotta would know.

He is a co-inventor of 12 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Two of them the antiretrovirals lamivudine and emtricitabine were instrumental in curbing the spread of H.I.V. the latter having made possible the first-ever combination therapy for the virus in a once-daily pill. Dr. Liotta is considered a leader in discovering new disease-fighting drugs.

Now many scientists think another drug from Dr. Liotta’s lab could similarly transform the fight against Covid-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(“Twisto”) and has also entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining shares of UAE-based BNPL leader Spotii Holdings Ltd (“Spotii”).

The transactions align with Zip's global expansion plans and the rapidly accelerating global BNPL opportunity. As demonstrated through the acquisition of QuadPay where annual transactions have soared by over 200% post acquisition Zip is building its playbook in successfully identifying completing and integrating strategic acquisitions. Twisto and Spotii are now well-positioned to leverage the benefits of this competency and the synergies of a truly global payments organisation. Twisto and Spotii are integrated into Zip’s global Single Merchant Interface (SMI) which provides merchants instant access to 11 countries across five continents.

Summary

Following Zip’s successful expansion to the US and the UK the Company is now extending its BNPL operations to Europe and the Middle East.

Europe is a $1.1 trillion annual eCommerce market 1 and Twisto’s license can be passported to all 27 member states of the EU.

and Twisto’s license can be passported to all 27 member states of the EU. Spotii was founded in 2020 and operates in the Middle East one of the fastest-growing global eCommerce regions.

These strategic transactions will enable Zip to respond to the increased demand from merchants for a single global BNPL solution across multiple markets with a consistent global service quality.

Zip has adopted a similar approach to Quadpay which proved to be highly successful. By initially making low-risk minority investments Zip is well placed to validate cultural fit and management alignment stress test the business plan and identify synergies and plan for integration.

Zip expects to complete the Spotii acquisition in Q3 CY21 and the Twisto acquisition in Q4 CY21.

The acquisitions2 have a combined enterprise value of ~$180 million3 with transaction consideration of ~$160 million reflecting Zip’s current equity interests in both companies to be funded with either cash and/or shares at Zip’s discretion.

Twisto Acquisition

The decision to acquire Twisto marks an important step in Zip’s European strategy. The acquisition will complement Zip's UK presence which launched earlier this year and provides a gateway to one of the largest eCommerce markets globally. The strategic rationale of the transaction includes:

Access to 27 European Union (EU) countries: the EU is the world’s second-largest eCommerce market with $1.1 trillion annual volume. Twisto holds a European Payment Institution license enabling the provision of payments services across all EU member states subject to regulatory consents.

We have been impressed by the Twisto team their deep customer focus and product set and look forward to working closely with them to deliver on the opportunities we jointly have in front of us.”

Spotii Acquisition

The acquisition of Spotii establishes Zip as a leading player in the Middle East with Spotii operational in the UAE and KSA and poised to expand further. The strategic rationale of the transaction includes:

Under the acquisition Zip will purchase the remaining shares in Spotii9 that Zip does not already own for an amount of ~USD$16 million10 (~$21 million) implying an enterprise value of ~USD$20 million (~$26 million). The completion of the acquisition is expected to occur in Q3 CY2111. Refer to disclosures lodged with the Australian Stock Exchange for further information about the material terms of the Spotii acquisition.

Anuscha Ahmed Spotii’s Co-Founder and CEO said:

“Since founding Spotii in early 2020 we’ve seen significant uptake of the platform by merchants and customers highlighting the appetite and need for BNPL solutions in the MENA region. Joining forces with Zip – a global leader in the BNPL space – will enable us to drive further growth by tapping into the company’s advanced technology and expertise. For merchants it means greater access to customers outside the MENA region while BNPL customers in the regional markets will have greater access to international merchants. Ultimately it highlights the Middle East as a growing region for eCommerce and BNPL offerings.”

Zip Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Larry Diamond said:

“The Spotii acquisition is an important step in Zip’s global expansion and international strategy with Ecommerce in the Middle East on a significant upward trajectory. We have been working with Spotii since our initial investment in December 2020 to broaden our understanding of the BNPL opportunity in the region and have a number of exciting global merchants we are looking forward to activating in the coming months. We also believe there is a large untapped opportunity to bring BNPL to emerging markets where cash on delivery remains a significant merchant challenge and where the digitisation of retail accelerates.”

This release was approved by the Chief Executive Officer on behalf of the Board.

Japan follows launches in Australia New Zealand Hong Kong Malaysia and Singapore to further extend Adyen’s local acquiring capabilities in Asia-Pacific.

According to GlobalData the data and analytics company the Covid pandemic has further accelerated ecommerce growth in Japan. And as Japanese consumers continue to embrace online shopping the use of electronic payments will rise as consumers continue to move away from cash-based payments.

The Japanese government has also set a goal of increasing cashless payments from 20 per cent to around 40 per cent of all transactions by 2025.

Adyen provides end-to-end infrastructure connecting directly to Visa Mastercard and consumers’ globally preferred payment methods to deliver frictionless payments across online mobile and in-store channels.

Its all-in-one payment platform allows merchants including Microsoft Foodpanda VanMoof Breitling and G-Star to get the most out of each transaction with local payment processing. The company manages the entire payment flow including gateway risk management and acquiring for its merchants.

New avenues

Warren Hayashi president of Asia-Pacific at Adyen said: “Asia-Pacific is a key growth driver for many of our international merchants and therefore for Adyen. We’re excited to bring our full-stack solution to merchants in Japan as more companies transition to digital payments. Merchants can discover new avenues for growth and offer richer customer experiences with our payment optimization tools and data insights.”

While Trevor Nies senior director of e-commerce payments risk operations & analytics at Microsoft added: “We are excited to be one of the first to go live with Adyen in Japan and offer our customers a seamless payment experience. Adyen is one of our strategic partners who processes payments for us globally across nearly all Microsoft products and services.”

With direct card acquiring connections with Visa Mastercard JCB American Express Diners Discover and Union Pay transactions will be processed locally in Japan via the Adyen platform.

A takeout restaurant gave food away free to thousands of customers after a computer glitch caused bank card transactions to fail to register.

But customers at Four Star locations in Flatts Somerset and Warwick as well as the Glaze Bakery on Church Street have now had the cash deducted from their accounts – up to five months after they made their purchases.

Marico Thomas the president of Four Star and Glaze said the error kicked in on December 31 last year and lasted until February 7.

No transactions from debit or credit cards from any financial institutions were processed over the period.

The problem was only spotted a few weeks ago when Four Star realised that receipts were down.

Mr Thomas contacted electronic payments firm Global Payments Bermuda and asked for an explanation.

Global told Mr Thomas this week that “certain transactions … were authorised but not completed due to a Monetra software error”.

The firm said: “For these transactions funds were not debited from the customer accounts nor settled into your accounts.”

The company added that the problem had been fixed and that the payments were reprocessed on Monday.

Mr Thomas said yesterday the glitch was not detected immediately because the company was short-staffed and customer demand was high because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

He added: “We were focusing on customer care and not reconciliation.”

Mr Thomas said he believed thousands of customers were affected and that some had contacted him this week to ask why they had been billed.

He admitted: “If they came here five months ago and only get a transaction on their statement now it’s understandable that they’re going to question it.”

Mr Thomas posted a message on social media site Facebook to highlight the error this week in an attempt to ease the “strain and aggravation”.

It read: “Exceptional customer service and engagement is the foundation of our business and you are the most important part of our business.

“So when challenges arise that negatively impact you it is important that we engage with you as soon as possible to provide you with an explanation and ensure that we maintain your confidence in us as your food service provider of choice.

“Some of the transactions authorised at certain Four Star locations were not fully processed.

“We are more than willing to provide you with the in-depth technical details of the failure but essentially there is a two-part process to credit card transactions.

“Authorisation and confirmation is received from your financial institution that there are sufficient funds to proceed and process the transaction and the authorised funds are subsequently withdrawn from your account for payment which concludes the transaction.

“Unfortunately between December 31 2020 and February 7 2021 the authorised funds for approximately 10000 of our customers were never withdrawn from your accounts or paid for by your credit card provider.

“Enclosed with this correspondence is a copy of the letter from our card processing agency which provides additional information and the actions that have or will be taken.

“Please note that reprocessing of cards has started and if you have not seen a transaction occurring on your account already it will likely occur the end of the month.

“We sincerely apologise for this inconvenience to you and are keenly aware of how frustrating this may be.

The message added: ““We do expect that there may be a heavy volume of e-mails in respect of this so we ask for your patience with us during this time.

“Please note that every e-mail is read and will be responded to.”

Anyone affected should e-mail info@fourstar.bm"

This baby is borderline famous in the MLB ballpark community and if you’ve ever watched a Rangers broadcast you know that this is going to make TV multiple times throughout the game.

Michael Kay Yankee’s broadcaster was obsessed with it. He spent a good portion of game one panning the crowd and keeping tabs on the progress of brave indulgers. This was great for business as it gave me the opportunity to drum up interest online prior to the game and really hype up #thefoodguy vs BOOM challenge that awaited me.

Did you finish it?

If you keep this up I am going to BOOM stick you. I will tell you this it wasn’t pretty and it wasn’t easy and if I knew then what I know now I don’t think I would have attempted it. Named after ex-Ranger Nelson Cruz for his massive homeruns this hot dog weighs 3 lbs. and is over 2 feet long. It’s wrapped in a very doughy brioche style bun and then topped with jalapenos cheese chili and sauteed onions. It comes in a cardboard suitcase with a handle. They give you 3 forks because they assume no sane person is going to eat this thing by themselves but we know from past food vids- I AM NO SANE PERSON. So I waited in a long line outside of section 143 the only place that sells this meat stick trophy and settled in for a 3-inning ride that punished me back as hard as I punished it.

Meat sweats. Check. Borderline hallucinations. Check. A section of strangers cheering me on. Check. A very proud EIC. Check.

This week was special as it was the first time me and Vitali actually met in person even though we’ve been working together for over a year. He’s a great dude funny as hell and he cheered me on through all the different levels of emotion and pain it takes to finish a 3 lb. meat stick. Enjoy this week.

Sworn to secrecy Mr. Zaslav’s lieutenants snacked on a breakfast of artisanal doughnuts from a 24-hour bakery as they finalized their pitch. Just before 8 a.m. ahead of schedule their quarry arrived: John Stankey the AT&T chief executive who controlled the WarnerMedia assets that Mr. Zaslav coveted.

A journey that began with an informal emoji-speckled email exchange in February was now fully underway. The covert discussions would eventually last three months stretching from Dallas to the Denver suburbs to downtown Manhattan where a war room was established in the cramped garden level of the rented townhouse. To prevent leaks bankers used maritime nicknames like “Columbus” and “Magellan.” Even the chief executive of WarnerMedia was kept in the dark while his company was being negotiated out from under him.

It would culminate on Monday with the announcement of a blockbuster media deal that combined AT&T’s WarnerMedia including HBO CNN and the Warner Bros. film studio with Discovery’s cable and broadcast holdings creating a powerful new force in American entertainment sports reality TV news and streaming video. And it represented an astounding late career act for Mr. Zaslav 61 that would put him in control of one of the biggest media companies in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2UvZHJlc3MtY29kZS1iYW5raW5nLWludGVybnNoaXBz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The fashion faux pas of finance interns as recalled by senior bankers,"If you've got an internship in an investment bank and it's not virtual then you will already know about not wearing brown shoes or purple suits or short skirts or braces (suspenders in the U.S.). You should know that you can't wear flip flops at Barclays (or anywhere else) no matter how much global warming is making itself felt and that T-shirts celebrating your preferred band are out. But maybe you need reminding.

We asked a handful of senior bankers to recollect the worst incidences of sartorial impropriety they'd witnessed among the intern community. They suggested the examples below. If you're an intern at an investment bank this summer let this be your definitive guide to what must not be done.

1. The one in the cut price suit bought by his mother

She meant well but your mother probably did not buy you a well-tailored but inconspicuous suit. ""We get interns turning up in the suits their mother bought"" says banker who's seen a lot of intern seasons. ""They look like photocopier salesmen.""

2. The one with the offensively expensive watch

If you're an intern who's into watches you might've read that article by GSElevator where he says it helps to turn up in a Rolex. It doesn't. Remember that GSElevator didn't work for GS: he worked for Citi. In Hong Kong. Things there were probably a little different.

""Flash watches were never a thing at GS"" says one ex-Goldman partner. ""Blankfein had a cheap Casio. An intern with a flash watch is going to be weird. No one is impressed by a kid with money.""

""I had an intern show up with a watch worth more than my car"" says a fund manager. ""Massive faux pas.""

3. The one who turned up dressed as a bro'

Ok so you probably know this but you can't arrive looking all casual. ""We had a hick American student who we took as part of the contract with a state pension fund from some flyover state. He used to show up daily in classic bro' frat wear - tracksuit bottoms and check shirt. Used to have to tell him to go sit in the toilet when we had clients in"" says one PM.

4. The one who thought it was all about dressing like the banker archetype

You also want to avoid being the one who's dressed like everyone thinks a banker should look. You don't want to be the one in red braces/suspenders and you don't want to be the one who's been spotted walking around the City of London in a top hat and briefcase. You want to keep it simple.

""It's always amazing to me how anyone can screw up"" says one Wall Street equities banker. ""It's about dark suits light shirts conservative shoes and accessories..""

""It's not about power dressing at all"" agrees the ex-GS partner. ""You need a dark two piece suit two or three shirts (white or blue no stripes) and two simple dark ties. A five pack of socks. You're done.""

5. The one whose tie was exactly the same as the security guard's

You don't want to be the intern who can't tie a tie (see YouTube for instructions). Nor do you want to be the intern whose tie is the same as the security guard's. This has happened.

6. The one who was trying too hard to be on trend

It's harder to know what to wear as a female intern. The equities banker says young women get it wrong when they try to be fashionable. ""It's not a fashion show; don't try to be hip and trendy. You don't want to be remembered for your clothing (whether good or bad); you want to be remembered for your work and ideas"" she advises. This means sticking to suits of similar hues to those worn by the men. No platform shoes No peep toes.

7. The one with the shirt issues

Lastly you don't want to be remembered for your armpits. ""I've seen a few interns sweat through their shirts like a stuck pig. You either need to change your shirts or wear an undershirt. That is gross"" says the equities saleswoman. The Goldman partner adds that you need to learn how to iron and that ""Spray starch is a bloody lifesaver.""

“Sometimes after a colonoscopy one two or three polyps were discovered so it was important for me to continue with this regime” says the 56-year-old Hongkonger.

Simone Song Hong-fang was 26 when she first had polyps removed from her colon and learned she would have to undergo a regular colonoscopy – an exam to detect changes or abnormalities in the large intestine and rectum. She had a family history of colon cancer; her grandfather had died of the disease.

While at Goldman Sachs as a managing director responsible for investment banking and activities in Asia she would fly overseas and return home the same week – and almost every week. “That’s how banking ladies were trained to be: we were iron ladies” she says explaining how her body adjusted to long hours and extensive travel.

Then in 2015 she got the scare of her life.

After her work getting Chinese biotech company 3SBio listed on the Hong Kong exchange in a successful market debut of around US$750 million Song took the time to have an overdue colonoscopy.

Once you reach a certain age don’t skip your checks Simone Song

“The doctor told me: ‘We found some polyps but also something that could be a tumour’” she recalls. Even if the mass the scan found was benign Song was told there was a one in three chance that it could become cancerous so she should have it removed.

After seeking several doctors’ opinions Song agreed to the operation to have “peace of mind”. A 15cm length of her intestines was removed. Her family including her three children were fearful the mass was malignant and wondered whether she would recover.

“When I woke up from surgery the first thing I saw were two pairs of eyes (her daughters’) staring at me filled with fear” she said.

As she waited for the biopsy results Song vowed to change her life. If she did not have cancer she would spend the second part of her healthy life helping people with cancer . She wanted to do something more impactful to make her life worth living.

When she learned she did not have cancer she immediately resigned from the company for which she had worked for the past six years.

“Once you reach a certain age don’t skip your checks” she said. “I had no symptoms [prior to this health scare].” Song’s most recent colonoscopy was last year.

Colorectal cancer is the most common type of cancer to afflict Hongkongers. Each year around 6000 people in the city learn they have it and over 2000 die of the disease.

To reduce the likelihood of having colon cancer regular screenings are advised. The American Cancer Society recommends starting routine colorectal cancer screening at age 45. It suggests those with an increased risk such as a family history of colon cancer or chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease should start screening earlier and get screened more often. Talk to your doctor about what screenings they recommend based on your personal or family history.

Song is now the founder and senior partner of Hong Kong-based health care fund ORI Capital for which she raised US$200 million from her contacts. Its focus is in three areas: innovations in cancer treatment; chronic conditions caused by metabolic disorders such as diabetes and heart disease and; neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia.

There’s a general awareness now of what a small virus can do; people have learned that it’s probably a good idea to support people trying to save lives Simone Song

One of the companies ORI Capital initially invested in is California-based CG Oncology a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company which is developing a new virus-based therapy to treat advanced bladder cancer patients with a form of the disease that leaves them no treatment options other than a resection of the bladder.

“Our goal is to prevent the progression of the tumour as well as preserving their bladder as these patients are typically around 70 years old and do not want their whole bladder removed” says CG Oncology’s chief executive Arthur Kuan.

In its phase two trial study involving 65 patients with this disease participants received the new therapy directly into the bladder in two courses (each course administered once a week for six weeks) plus maintenance courses. The results published in the Urologic Oncology journal in 2018 showed an efficacy rate of 29 per cent at 12 months after the first treatment meaning around a third of patients in that time period experienced a complete clearance of any visible tumour.

Side effects in participants were short-term low-grade urinary tract symptoms and there were no serious adverse affects related to the drug.

According to Kuan this immunotherapy product targets tumour cells selectively kills them directly then triggers a secondary immune response to attack residual cancer cells in the system a two-pronged mechanism to fight this disease.

Kuan adds that there is an on-off switch on the virus DNA so it only turns on within tumour cells and not healthy cells making the therapy “very safe” as it’s highly selective in killing bladder tumour cells.

Once inside a tumour cell the DNA activates so that the virus replicates within the tumour cell. “As [the] virus production rate is faster than cancer cell replication newly made virus would burst out of the cancer cell killing it” explains Kuan.

It also induces an immune response in which the immune system’s T-cells (a type of white blood cell) circulate back and target and annihilate cancer cells that weren’t killed by the virus.

A phase three study is under way involving 110 patients as the company seeks to achieve US Food and Drug Administration approval.

Song is now raising money (US$400 million) for her company’s second fund as the first fund has been fully invested with around 80 per cent already paid back to its investors after successful bets on several biotech companies.

According to Song the pandemic made the health care space a “moneymaking machine now” as investors see the big wealth impact from successful biotech companies.

“There’s a general awareness now of what a small virus can do; people have learned that it’s probably a good idea to support people trying to save lives from diseases” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcGl0Y2hib29rLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzL2ZpbnRlY2gtdGFrZXMtYWltLWF0LWEtNDAwYi1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXB1enpsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fintech takes aim at a $400B healthcare puzzle,"After Omry Ben David’s wife gave birth via a C-section the couple received an unexpected medical bill totaling $20000.

The pair was stunned. Ben David at the time was an investment banker in New York and he assumed that most of the medical expenses would be paid for by Goldman Sachs’ health insurance. It turned out that while the hospital was a part of the health network one of the doctors was out-of-network and therefore not covered by the policy.

The experience led Ben David to recognize that for average American households unanticipated medical bills that are much smaller than the one his family faced could be a significant strain.

Now Ben David a partner with Israel-based Viola Ventures is part of a crop of VC investors betting on a fintech solution that allows patients to pay for healthcare in small increments over months—or even years. That approach could make the financial burden of large medical bills more manageable while helping doctors and hospitals increase their payment collection rates.

Ben David led Viola’s incubation and a $5 million seed investment in PayZen a startup that works with healthcare systems to offer patients zero-interest fee-free payment plans akin to the buy-now pay-later options provided by companies like Affirm and Klarna.

PayZen which publicly launched earlier this year says it almost instantly approves 100% of the loan applicants and in turn pays hospitals upfront a discounted portion of what the patient owes.

Walnut and PrimaHealth Credit are two other buy-now pay-later startups that work with providers that offer only elective procedures such as dental surgeries and LASIK.

The US healthcare payments system is ripe for disruption. Just two decades ago fees paid by patients accounted for only 5% of hospitals and doctors’ revenue but by 2017 that portion was up to 35%. And the patients’ burden is expected to grow amid the increasing reliance on high-deductible medical plans and overall rising costs of healthcare.

As a result out-of-pocket spending stood at more than $406 billion in 2019 a giant market opportunity for fintech startups to tackle.

What’s more healthcare providers collect only a portion of what patients owe with estimates ranging from 20% to 55%.

For hospitals trying to collect these fees is expensive and often counterproductive according to Ben David.

“If I am a patient and my hospital just sent a collections agency after me then the whole relationship is broken (and) I will never go back there” he said.

Healthcare debt is widely recognized as the No. 1 cause of personal bankruptcies in the US.

In the meantime with hospitals experiencing mounting financial pressure increasing collections from patients would help with their cash-flow problems.

“There is a spectrum of activities where fintech companies can help” said Matt Risley a partner with QED Investors a financial services-focused VC firm.

Patients are often confused by their medical bills which come by mail weeks and sometimes months after the actual treatment. Payment startups can alleviate this problem by using digital tools to personalize the patient billing communication process and presenting one easy-to-understand bill rather than five different bills like one from the surgeon and another from the anesthesiologist Risley said.

Among other payments startups focused on healthcare Cedar was valued at $3.2 billion when Tiger Global led a $200 million investment in March. Norwest Ventures-backed VisitPay earlier this month announced its $300 million acquisition by R1 RCM. Another payments specialist Flywire plans to debut on the Nasdaq in the coming days with a potential valuation of $2.4 billion.

All these companies also offer interest-free payment plans Risley said but they offer only software and loan administration rather than lending.



The advantage of partnerships with a lender like PayZen is that hospitals get paid a discounted portion of the entire bill right away and don’t need to worry about collecting from patients.

Robert Le a PitchBook fintech analyst said that while the buy-now pay-later model could be a good option for cash-strapped healthcare providers he doesn’t see the payment plan approach as a primary financial solution for patients.

“I think there should be more innovation in the health insurance space to lower costs for the patient” Le said. These companies could focus on preventive measures by incentivizing their customers to lead healthier lifestyles using simple technologies that do things like remind them to get an annual physical or reward them for exercising he explained.

While they may not be a panacea payment plans appear to be a win-win for patients and providers. Cedar’s data for example shows that the usage of payment plans leads to overall higher collections for hospitals and physicians.

The challenge for fintech startups however is convincing the health systems which tend to be very bureaucratic to adopt new tech solutions.

“Healthcare payments is a huge market but the reason we don’t see big companies like Stripe or Affirm addressing it is because selling to a hospital system is one of the hardest sales that you can make” Risley said. “We will get there. It will just take longer than for other industries.”

The university teamed up with Halliburton – one of the world’s largest oil field service companies – to commission the new Drilling Fluids Lab (MUD Lab) at the Faculty of Engineering and Technology at the Turkeyen Campus on Friday.

A release from UG detailed that the lab is one of two which were negotiated during the GIPEX summit back in November 2019. The other specific high-tech software modelling lab will be commissioned in the coming weeks.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Paloma Mohamed Martin at the commissioning ceremony relayed that the Drilling Fluids Lab “is going to put our graduates far way ahead of the game in terms of their practical experience in analyzing fluids that are used on the FPSOs.”

She explained that the launching of the facility comes at a time when the university is about to roll out a suite of new programmes for persons who would like to specialise in certain areas including eight professional courses that were developed and will be administered by the Institute of Energy Diplomacy starting this June.

Additionally UG recently approved a Master in Environmental Management and the School for Entrepreneurship and Business Innovation (SEBI) in rolling out a Procurement and Value Chain Master’s Degree very soon the Vice-Chancellor said.

This is to join with the Associate Degree in Petroleum Engineering and the Master in Petroleum Engineering as well as the Master in Renewable Energy that is already being offered.

Meanwhile Halliburton Country Manager Vahman Jurai relayed that the drilling of fluids or drilling of mud is one of the main services the company provides in Guyana and is a fundamental part of its operations.

He explained that since the start of Haliburton’s Guyana operations to present it has been continually increasing capacity providing technical support and solutions to the market.

“We have significantly increased our portfolio solutions to the local energy. Presently almost 90% of our services come from Guyana and at the end of this year we will be close to 100%.

“The gift of the Fluids Lab to the Faculty of Engineering and Technology is one of our initiatives in building capacity in Guyana. We view it as an investment in the future of the students who will grow to be potential industry leaders and who will shape the sustainability of the energy industry in Guyana” Jurai said.

Also giving remarks was the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology at the University Verlyn Klass who noted that the lab will support the teaching of courses and give students an added advantage when seeking employment as Mud Technicians.

The physical demonstration of the equipment in the Mud Lab was facilitated by Dinesh Baldeosingh Technical Professional Senior Halliburton; and Morris Solomon Laboratory Technician Halliburton.

The entire agreement (MUD LAB LandMark Computer Lab training Maintenance and Staff and Student Development) between UG and Halliburton is valued at US$2.2 million of which the MUD Lab project accounts for about US$20000.

The collaboration is aimed at facilitating enhanced training for students in the Departments of Petroleum and Geological Engineering Chemistry and certain aspects of Earth and Environmental Sciences.

Other aspects of the project include maintenance training technical support for staff and student development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL29wLWVkL3RoZS1haWRzLWZpZ2h0LW9mZmVycy1hLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtcGF0ZW50LXBhdGh3YXkvYXJ0aWNsZTM0NjE3OTA3LmVjZdIBdGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL29wLWVkL3RoZS1haWRzLWZpZ2h0LW9mZmVycy1hLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtcGF0ZW50LXBhdGh3YXkvYXJ0aWNsZTM0NjE3OTA3LmVjZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The AIDS fight offers a COVID vaccine patent pathway,"May 22 2021 12:02 am | Updated July 06 2022 12:17 pm IST

In order to achieve global herd immunity and prevent new strains of COVID-19 from emerging possibly for years to come vaccines need to be affordable and available in massive quantities throughout the globe. This can happen through patent owners voluntarily licensing their products to other companies especially Indian producers who are experienced at mass-producing low-cost medications. This can also be done by temporarily suspending patent rights for COVID vaccines an option that is being pursued by India and South Africa through the World Trade Organization (WTO) and one that is legal in the event of a public health emergency according to that organisation’s own rules. One way or the other India and the world need several Indian pharmaceutical companies not just the Serum Institute of India to gain the right to make these vaccines if we are going to see an end to this pandemic any time soon.

Turning point in the HIV fight

Decades of struggles over patent rights and access to medications for HIV/AIDS demonstrate that it is possible to navigate patent restrictions using something called “voluntary licenses” where a patent holder decides to license a product to other producers. The United Nations’ Medicines Patent Pool and the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool are important tools in an effort to promote voluntary licensing for COVID products that so far have been ignored by pharmaceutical producers. Sharing patent rights through voluntary licensing would need to involve India’s large pharmaceutical sector whose production capacity helped make treatments for AIDS more affordable in low-income countries and helped mitigate that pandemic.

In the 1990s the WTO began implementing a global intellectual property regime known as the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement or TRIPS. While TRIPS alarmed public health experts because of its potential to raise the price of essential medicines voluntary licensing agreements between pharmaceutical producers were able to bring down the price of AIDS medications despite the TRIPS regulations.

Responding to anti-TRIPS activism from low-income countries and realising they would not be able to profit off of low-income markets anyway some manufacturers placed licensing agreements to produce AIDS drugs for which they owned patent rights in the UN-affiliated Medicines Patent Pool. Several India-based companies then used these voluntary licences to manufacture these drugs on a massive scale and sold them at prices they determined. In the case of Gilead which placed more products in the Patent Pool than any other producer their licences required the licensee to pay Gilead a royalty of 3% of the sales of the drug and limit sales to low-income countries. This effort brought down the price of key AIDS medications in these countries. Most significantly tenofovir a first-line treatment for HIV/AIDS has come down in price from $200-$500 per person per year to $39 per person per year in low-income countries now that 13 India-based pharmaceutical companies are producing it.

Context of health emergency

It is also possible for governments to issue what are called “compulsory licenses” which override patent rights to allow local production or import of drugs by generic manufacturers in the event of a public health crisis. Since 2003 this right has been enshrined in the Doha Declaration addendum to the WTO’s TRIPS agreement and this is what India and South Africa are lobbying for having recently been joined by the United States though not as of yet the European Union (EU). The Doha addendum Section 5c offers AIDS malaria and tuberculosis as examples of what qualifies as a health emergency. By this standard COVID-19 should easily qualify. In fact not invoking Doha exemptions in this unprecedented health crisis would make this agreement meaningless. We may thus find compulsory licences being issued in several countries for vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 although manufacturers in India say they prefer to work with voluntary licences because there is more good will between companies while compulsory licences often come with a legal battle brought by the patent holder. Voluntary licences also enable production to begin more expeditiously as they usually are accompanied by “technology transfer” meaning that the patent holder reveals to the licensee how to manufacture the medication sparing the licensee the lengthy and costly process of figuring out how to reverse engineer the product.

The COVAX option

Some favour ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX programme which was established to purchase vaccine doses and donate them to low-income countries but does not involve modifying patent rights. Similar ventures during the AIDS crisis were chronically underfunded and had only minor effects on that pandemic compared to the voluntary licensing and mass production of antiretroviral drugs from Indian producers. COVAX is also currently underfunded and the Director-General of WHO Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that people in the lowest-income countries might have to wait until 2022 to get vaccinated through this programme which may actually be optimistic since COVAX has shipped around 68 million doses so far.

Similar concerns to those presented here were raised in last year’s annual meeting of WHO which established a patent-sharing pool for COVID products the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool. So far no patent holders have joined this effort which is why India and South Africa called on the WTO to temporarily waive patent protections for COVID-19. Meanwhile the UN Medicines Patent Pool stands ready to accept voluntary licences having added a placeholder for COVID-19 on the list of diseases they address. Hopefully the EU will join the efforts by India and South Africa at the WTO and pharmaceutical producers will realise as some did during the AIDS pandemic that voluntary licensing comes with better public relations and that they are not going to make money off low-income countries regardless of patent enforcement.

A key step

Furthermore the billions of dollars in government aid given to companies to help develop COVID-19 treatments should entail an obligation to enable the mass production of affordable vaccines. After all as legal scholars have long explained patents are not ironclad ownership rights. They are a temporary contract that balances the public interest with the claims of the innovator. This is not just a question of social justice and ensuring life-saving therapies are available to the world’s poor. It is a necessary step to prevent deadlier more contagious and possibly vaccine-resistant variants of COVID-19 from proliferating in an under-vaccinated world.

World-class touring performances come through at venues like the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts. And local companies like TheaterWorks showcase contemporary work. The city is also committed to promoting diverse artists and voices. For example the unique Artists Collective highlights the work of the African Diaspora. And the Real Art Ways organization supports experimental and new work in a variety of mediums.”

The website also notes that “Good quality and cost of living go a long way toward supporting an artist's lifestyle. And if the urban scene isn't sufficiently inspiring Connecticut's natural beauty is also sure to spark the imagination.” And there’s this: “Beyond the artistic community Hartford is also very affordable for working artists.”

There are 4000 performances and exhibits and 600 free events annually in Hartford according to data compiled by the Greater Hartford Arts Council. The arts also support 7000 jobs. On the immediate horizon is Make Music Day slated for June 21. A year ago the Arts Council gathered a dozen artists from the Greater Hartford community to form the first Artist Advisory Council. The mission is to inform support and educate the Greater Hartford Arts Council about its role as an advocate for artists in the Greater Hartford region.

Hartford is not the only Connecticut city to earn a place among the top 50 in the rankings. New Haven finished at number 17 tied with Milwaukee; Stamford was number 38 tied with White Plains N.Y. And Norwalk was number 47.

The rankings looked at cities with at least 50000 people according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 population estimates and ranked each city in each of four categories: Performing arts businesses and establishments per density Museums per density Walk score and Average rent of a studio apartment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9yb2JlcnQtbXVycmF5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTk5NjE4NjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Murray Obituary (2021) - Hartford CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/robert-murray-obituary?id=9961864 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9yb2JlcnQtbXVycmF5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTk5NjE4NjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vaGFydGZvcmRoYXdrcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzUvMjIvaGF3ay1uYXRpb24tY2x1Yi1oYXJ0Zm9yZC1hdGhsZXRpY3MtbG9zZXMtdG9tLXJlaWNoLWhhd2tzLWdyZWF0ZXN0LXN1cHBvcnRlci5hc3B40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hartford Athletics Loses Tom Reich Hawks' Greatest Supporter,"The University of Hartford Department of Athletics is saddened to report the passing of longtime Hawk Tom Reich who died Saturday.

Or two. Having recently added the massive 13-inch Surtur figure the line’s going big again. The nearly as huge original MCU villain will join him. That’d be Iron Monger the extra-large opponent to Tony Stark’s Iron Man. And in addition to his “final boss” form the big mech comes with the man behind its mask. It’s Obadiah Stane Tony’s old and deceptive partner who resembles a bald Jeff Bridges. (And yes The Big Lebowski exists in the MCU so the resemblance would be noted.)

Hasbro made Iron Monger before as a comics build-a-figure and a movie deluxe figure but this one appears to be all-new. The $73.99 price tag may sound daunting but it’s actually standard with the premium upcharge the Infinity saga line has. Prior to this year’s across-the-board price raise a regular figure would run $20 and a repackaged build-a-figure $40. Add the $6.50 upcharge the boxed figures get now which was $5 before this year — $26.50 + $46.50 — $73. So that’s just a $1 larger upcharge on the loose BAF-sized guy.

Also joining the line: Captain America as he appeared in Avengers: Infinity War. Previously released as a figure this version now comes with more deco and additional angry head and two painted vibranium shields. This Wakanda Cap will arrive exclusively at Walmart. Meanwhile Iron Monger preorders are up at Entertainment Earth and other sites. (Superhero Hype is part of the Entertainment Earth affiliate program and earns fees from purchases made through our links.)

Best of all for customizers: anyone who owns the casualwear figure of “Bro Thor” can now turn him into an actual Jeffrey Lebowski. Just carefully remove his hair add it to bald Obadiah head switch and it’s done. Such figure aggression will stand man. Get a close-up look at Stane and more in our gallery below.

When audiences meet back up with Cap in Avengers: Infinity War he's looking a little worse for wear with a beard shaggy hair and a uniform that looks like it's been in a few scrapes. He's also without his iconic red white and blue shield having left it behind following his altercation with Tony Stark in Civil War.

So Chris Evans' Steve might not have been doing well for a given time but Hasbro sure is! The toy company has been on a spree of releasing new Marvel Legends figures based on MCU characters. From The Falcon and the Winter Soldier to Black Widow. Additionally they also have a new Infinity Saga wave dedicated to filling in the blanks for action figures as far as past MCU films go.

GET THIS MAN A SHIELD

And speaking of the figure's head sculpts they both feature an authentic likeness to Chris Evans and use Hasbro's special proprietary PhotoReal face printing technology.

THAT'S IT FOR HASBRO'S INFINITY SAGA COLLECTION

And that makes ten! Steve is the last figure to be shown in this wave. Now something similar could always be done by Hasbro in 2022. Although there's been much speculation that next year's special program will be devoted to figures from the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy to commemorate the first film's 20th anniversary.

Still Hasbro had quite the haul regardless. There were some much-needed redos and some all new characters introduced to the action figure line.

The figures themselves will begin shipping in late Summer 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzIyL3N0YXItd2Fycy10aGUtYmxhY2stc2VyaWVzLWNsb25lLXdhcnMtb2JpLXdhbi1rZW5vYmktcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star Wars The Black Series Clone Wars Obi-Wan Kenobi review — Lyles Movie Files,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lylesmoviefiles.com/2021/05/22/star-wars-the-black-series-clone-wars-obi-wan-kenobi-review/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzIyL3N0YXItd2Fycy10aGUtYmxhY2stc2VyaWVzLWNsb25lLXdhcnMtb2JpLXdhbi1rZW5vYmktcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Lakeland Florida – The Lakeland Police Department arrested a Lakeland woman for grand theft fraud and other charges stemming from the alleged theft of more than $65000 in medication from her employer.

On May 12 2021 Lakeland Police Arrested Patricia Johnson DOB: 9/8/1965 of Lakeland. Her employer Lakeland Pediatric Dentistry found medication missing and allege Johnson is responsible. The following is a long exerpt from the Lakeland Police affidavit and specifically Detective Heather Benthal (It should be noted that this is an unedited report of facts by the Lakeland Police Department. These facts are up for question and everyone is entitled to question the validity of facts by law enforcement in a court of law. The Daily Ridge does not rewrite these facts as some meanings or interpretations could be in error and change context. We hope readers appreciate being able to read the information and come to their own understanding and conclusions) :

“On 1/29/21 at 1446 pm I was advised to respond to Lakeland Pediatric Dentistry located at 1111 North Parkway Frontage Rd Lakeland Polk County FL in reference to an employee stealing medications from the business. I was further advised the employee had stolen more medication that day and had been caught via hidden camera. The employee later identified as Patricia “Tricia” Johnson was still on property and was unaware of the discovery by her employers.



Upon my arrival I made contact with Dr. Aaron Scheps one of the partners in the dental office. I conducted a sworn/recorded interview with Dr. Scheps.

Dr. Scheps advised me he had noticed medication missing from their crash cart in late December while conducting inventory. The crash cart is only used in emergencies and is usually inventoried when medications are set to expire. While inventory was being conducted he noticed the Clonidine/Diazepam 10mg which is used for high blood pressure/hypertension was nearly gone. The bottle contained 100 pills originally but currently only had 3 in it. Dr. Scheps advised they had not had any dental emergencies that required use of any of these medications so the bottle should have been full. Out of concern that the pills may have been stolen he ordered a new bottle to monitor the contents on a daily basis. Shortly after the new bottle arrived he again checked the contents and 40 pills had been removed. Based on this Dr. Scheps ordered a surveillance camera to place in the lab an area that is accessed by several employees and is not an area where privacy is expected. When the initial camera malfunctioned he ordered another. On 1/19/21 While waiting for the new camera to arrive Dr. Scheps also discovered that some Meperidine/Demerol (Schedule II narcotic) vials had been tampered with. One of the vials was completely empty and others had the tops removed and were re-attached with hotglue.

On 1/26/21 the new camera was operational. Dr. Scheps observed the camera footage taken that day and observed one of his employees Patricia “Tricia” Johnson enter the lab area. She removed the medication cabinet key from a drawer and unlocked the cabinet. She then removed a new/unused large bottle of Meperidine Syrup (500m) and placed it in her purse.

On 1/27/21 Dr. Scheps observed Patricia Johnson place a vial of Midazolam 10m) directly into her purse from the cabinet.

Dr. Scheps checked the medication logs and noticed Patricia Johnson has been ordering several medications and in quantities the doctors were not aware of nor would they have approved had they known. He also noticed several discrepancies and the inventory was not accurate to the amounts the records reflected.



On 1/29/21 Dr. Scheps noticed a shipment of Midazolam (10-12 boxes) had arrived. He took the keys to the medication cabinet and placed them on his person to avoid the medications from being removed without his knowledge. When be entered the lab later in the day be observed the cabinet was standing open. The medication side door was ajar and the right side where the log was kept was closed and locked. Dr. Scheps asked Patricia Johnson if she had logged the order into the written log and she advised she had Dr. Scheps knowing he had possession of the keys asked her again if she was sure she logged the shipment. She again stated yes. When Dr. Scheps advised that he had the keys and the log side of the cabinet was locked he stated she was suspicious in her answers. When Dr. Schep later checked the camera feed he observed Patricia retrieve a set of keys from her person open the left side medication cabinet and place a box of Midazolam in her purse. Dr. Schep then knew Patricia had made herself a personal copy of the medication cabinet keys.

Dr. Scheps then showed me camera footage from the camera bidden in the lab on his computer. On 1/26/21 at 1311 hrs I observed a white female with blonde hair that Dr. Scheps identified as Patricia Johnson place what he identified as Meperidine syrup (500m) in her purse. On 1/28/21 at 1252 hrs the same female retrieved a vial of Midazolam from the cabinet and place it in her purse. On 1/29/21 the video displayed the same female retrieving a box of Medazolam and place it in the same purse.

Dr. Scheps then showed me camera footage from the camera hidden in the lab on his computer. On 1/26/21 at 1311 hrs I observed a white female with blonde hair that Dr. Scheps identified as Patricia Johnson place what he identified as Meperidine syrup (500m) in her purse. On 1/28/21 at 1252 hrs the same female retrieved a vial of Midazolam from the cabinet and place it in her purse. On 1/29/21 the video displayed the same female retrieving a box of Medazolam and place it in the same purse.



Dr. Scheps estimates the amounts of missing/stolen prescription medications to be approximately $10000 in value however after a full audit of the medications ordered and not administered the actual stolen value was discovered to be $66504.33.



Upon conducting a post-Miranda recorded interview with Johnson she began to lie to me several times throughout the interview. When Johnson was confronted with the information that she had been captured via surveillance camera stealing medications she admitted that she had been stealing them from her employer due to her husband losing his insurance. Patricia Johnson advised her husband had been prescribed Medazolam by his physician Dr. Hostler but due to the loss of insurance she couldn’t afford the medication. Due to this she began stealing the medications around September/October 2020 for her husband who suffered a stroke in July 2020 leaving him with brain damage and seizures. When confronted with the large amount of Meperidine (Demerol) that had been stolen she advised she had surgery in February 2020 and was taking the Demerol herself for pain.



Upon pulling a medication history for Ronald it was discovered that he had never been prescribed Medazolam by any of his physicians.



Upon pulling a medication history for Patricia it was discovered that she had never been prescribed Demerol by any of her physicians.



Patricia voluntarily signed a written consent to search for her purse to retrieve the stolen items from her purse. In the center zipper area of Patricia’s purse which was located in the lab office that the medication was kept in I retrieved a box of Medazolam that contained 10 unopened vials. It appeared to be the same box that she was captured on surveillance video stealing. I also located several syringes a cutting instrument (believed to have been used to carefully cut labels and remove vial tops carefully where Patricia later glued them back on the vial to appear in tact). I also located a small bottle that Patricia identified as Demerol liquid and a water bottle with ‘TJ” marked on the lid that Patricia stated also contained Demerol There were also used vials of injectible Demerol and 2 additional vials of Midazolame.



Patricia also voluntarily signed a written consent to search for her residence located at 2590 Walker Rd

Lakeland to retrieve the remainder of the stolen medications and empty vials from her residence. Upon asking Patricia if she would allow us to come to her residence to retrieve the remaining medications syringes and vials

she consented.



Patricia led Det. Anderson and I into her bedroom and retrieved the items from various locations around her bedroom. I observed an uncapped syringe and a partially used vial on the dresser. Patricia advised since her husband just had a seizure one of the family members must have given him an injection. Patricia had a large amount of empty vials in baskets and boxes that were hidden throughout her bedroom. She also had unused medication in her safe which she turned over to me. Det. Carver arrived and Patricia also allowed him to enter. There was a large amount of used vials of Midazolam and Meperidine (Demerol). Multiple unused syringes were also recovered which Patricia advised were taken from the dental office. Det Anderson and I collected all of the recovered items. Patricia also voluntarily provided her uniforms to us to return to the dental omce as tbey requested ber not to return. I advised Patricia that I would return the uniforms for her when I returned to the office to retrieve additional evidence being prepared by Scheps. Upon looking at the legs of the uniform pants some of them appeared to have puncture/needle marks in the upper legs of the pants.

Due to Patricia being the primary caretaker for Ronald und there being a lot of required documentation that would need to be obtained from the medical suppliers as wen as a medication audit that needed to be conducted by the dental office it was determined that charges would be filed with the State Attorney’s Office on a later date.

A spreadsheet detailing the medication audit as well as the above recovered items were entered into LPD property and evidence.

Due to the three different incidents of theft that were captured on video I charged Patricia Johnson with three counts of Theft of a Controlled Substance. These thefts were identified by Dr. Scheps as Meperidine (Demerol) on 1/26/21 at 1311 hrs Midazolam on 1/28/21 at 1252 hrs and Midazolam again on 1/29/21. Miperidine is a Schedule II controlled narcotic and Midazolam is a Schedule IV controlled narcotic.

Due to the large amount of medications that were stolen along with a large number of syringes the tampering with multiple vials and bottles of medicadon which created a loss of these items to the business Patricia was also charged with Grand Theft $20000 < $100000.

Patricia was also charged with Fraudulently obtaining prescription medications due to her ordering medications she wasn’t authorized to order in quantities and concentrations she wasn’t authorized to order using Dr. Tarver’s DEA login.



On 2/24/2021 I was advised by Scheps that they had discovered 12 seperate DEA 222 forms that Patricia had forged the doctor’s names upon to authorize the ordering of Meperidine 50mg/5ml from Henry Schein and

Southern Anesthesia. These companies are medical suppliers that the dental office utilized for their supplies.

Dr. Scheps advised none of the victims/doctors would ever consent to nor authorize Patricia to fraudulently sign their names to any forms. Dr. Bopp and Dr. Tarver confirmed to Dr. Scheps that the forms (entered into evidence) displayed a signature that was not their own on 12 seperate occasions and desired prosecution. Due to this Patricia was also charged with 12 counts of Criminal use of personal identification.”

Johnson was arrested on May 12 2021 and taken to Polk County Jail. On May 13 2021 Johnson was released from prison after posting $9000 bond.",,,,,,,,,

Located in The Hollow region of Hersheypark Comet is best known for delighting generations of riders 42"" and taller (Reese's height category and above) during Springtime In The Park summer and Hersheypark In The Dark.

The modified double out-and-back classic wood coaster has two 24 passenger trains aptly named ""Mork's Comet"" and ""Halley's Comet."" The ride experience begins as soon as the train leaves the station and immediately climbs 96 feet up the chain lift hill. The coaster then rumbles down the first 47-degree drop and flies back up the next hill to make a swooping 180-degree turn that reveals a stunning view of The Hollow. Comet dips back down towards Spring Creek and sends riders on a series of twisting turns and hair-raising hills. A handful of airtime-filled bunny hills give riders a final thrill before arriving back at the station. Comet reaches a top speed of 50 miles per hour during its 3360-foot journey that lasts 1 minute 45 seconds.

AT&T’s blockbuster deal to merge its content subsidiary WarnerMedia to Discovery Inc. made waves in the media industry. But the deal required a bit of financial acrobatics to pull off involving a merger strategy known as a Reverse Morris Trust.

In a standard merger a large company buys a small company.

But the Reverse Morris Trust deal allows Discovery (the smaller company) to absorb a major asset from AT&T (the larger company or parent company).

According to the terms of the transaction AT&T (T) shareholders who will continue to own shares of AT&T will receive additional stock representing 71% of the combined Discovery/WarnerMedia company. Discovery shareholders of all three classes (DISCA DISCB DISCK) would have their shares converted to stock of a single class in the new combined company representing the other 29%.

AT&T will also get $43 billion in cash debt securities and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt.

The maneuver also has one major benefit: no taxes for the parent company and its shareholders.

How does a Reverse Morris Trust work?

In a Reverse Morris Trust deal a parent company creates a subsidiary containing the assets negotiated as part of the merger (also referred to as a “spinoff”). That subsidiary then merges with the outside company that agreed to the deal.

A key requirement in a Reverse Morris Trust deal is for the shareholders of the original parent company (the one that spun off the subsidiary) to be given a majority of shares in the new company.

If shareholders of the original parent company are not given a majority of shares then the deal is not a Reverse Morris Trust transaction and therefore may be taxable to the parent company and its stockholders.

The name comes from a 1966 court ruling that established the precedent for taxing such transactions.

Is a Reverse Morris Trust transaction common?

Reverse Morris Trust deals are far from the most common way to do an M&A deal. Recent transactions include Lockheed Martin’s deal with Leidos Holdings Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s deal with Computer Sciences Corporation and Citrix Systems’ deal with LogMeIn.

One challenge with a Reverse Morris Trust is finding the right fit. By design the outside company effectively has to be smaller than the subsidiary that’s spun out by the parent company (in order to make sure that the parent company’s shareholders get more than a majority of shares in the new company).

But if the outside company is too small the parent company may have just found it more feasible to purchase it outright.

Story continues

AT&T appeared to see Discovery as the right size — not too big and not too small — to get the deal done.

HLT,Hilton Worldwide,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWZseWVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzIyL3doYXQtZG8teW91LXRoaW5rLWFib3V0LWhpbHRvbi1ob25vcnMtY2hhbmdlcy10by10aGUtZnJlZS1icmVha2Zhc3QtYmVuZWZpdC1mb3ItZ29sZC1kaWFtb25kLW1lbWJlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Do You Think About Hilton Honors' Changes To The Free Breakfast Benefit for Gold / Diamond Members?,"Hilton Honors recently announced that it is temporarily dropping the free breakfast benefit at ‘full service’ hotels in the USA for Gold and Diamond members. Instead members will be offered a credit that can be applied to breakfast or any other food/drink charged to the room.

The new policy starts in July 2021 and will run (initially?) until the end of the year.

Details

Hilton hasn’t officially confirmed the value of the credits yet but it is understood to look something like the following:

$25 for luxury brands (Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts LXR Hotels & Resorts Conrad Hotels & Resorts)

$12 for full service/lifestyle brands; $15 for full service/lifestyle brands in ‘high-cost markets’ (Hilton Hotels & Resorts DoubleTree Canopy Signia Curio Collection Tapestry Collection Motto)

$10 for Hilton Garden Inn hotels

Credits must be used daily and apply to up to 2 registered guests per room.

Right now this initiative only applies to hotels in the United States.

Bottom line

The new policy primarily affects leisure travellers – particularly those who have family with them. Business travellers can typically get the cost of breakfast reimbursed.

This is a bit of a surprise move from Hilton – one of the big benefits of Hilton Honors Gold is the consistency of knowing you can have a free breakfast whenever you stay. I can’t see $15 getting you much to eat/drink at Hilton hotels in cities like New York and LA…

That said people who aren’t big breakfast eaters would almost certainly receive more ‘value’ overall from having a nice snack or drink using the credit later in the day.

It will be interesting to see how this plays out. Presumably Hilton thinks this is a way to save money that won’t annoy too many guests with elite status. If that theory is right expect to see the policy expanded to other regions and extended into next year and beyond.

What’s your view? – do you love free breakfast or would you be happier with a more flexible credit?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbmV3c3Jlc291cmNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlMTE1NzgwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SERENA Hotel Aventura Tapestry Collection by Hilton Opens in Florida,"SERENA Hotel Aventura Tapestry Collection by Hilton Opens in Florida

The Hologic 3D Genius A.I. Mammography System is the most up-to-date machine that is offered at this time and the software at Brooks rivals that of any machine in Western New York.

“The 3D unit is equipped with an additional High Definition package and artificial intelligence computer aided detection making it the most technological advanced unit in Western New York. As equipment ages at the hospital the hospital leadership and Board of Directors are focused on replacing aging equipment with the newest technology for the community” said Mary LaRowe hospital president and CEO. “Ken Morris COO has worked diligently with our medical providers employees and vendors to ensure a smooth transition to this new technology.”

This technology provides the sharpest and highest resolution of 3D images which generates images twice the tomosynthesis of a standard 3D exam. This capability in turn leads to a 40% reduction in false positive test results prevents calling patients back for additional films and can detect more invasive breast cancer.

The equipment also includes the SmartCurve paddle which uses less compression improving patient comfort. This combined with only a 3.7 second compression time has seen a 93% improved comfort level during the exam. With the faster screening times the radiation dosage is limited and well under the MSQA (Mammography Quality of Standards Act).

Brooks-TLC Hospital is accredited by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and partners with the Cancer Services Program (CSP) to provide screening support and information. One in eight women will get breast cancer and Brooks-TLC is working to decrease that statistic.

Americans continue to spend at elevated levels in and for the home. And now that people are becoming more comfortable with others in their homes the renovation projects that were sidelined during the pandemic are coming back in a major way. Home Depot posted another great quarter this week as it sees continued strength from DIYers and the best quarterly growth rate for its Pro customers on record.

The numbers:

The takeaways.

Frenetic demand for home improvement unabating. According to Bank of America’s consumer spending data Americans have been spending between 40% and 60% on home improvement vs. 2019 through the first five months of the year. This comes after a stretch of many months during which spending ran up triple digits year-over-year. When we look back at what happened during the pandemic we will see changes that were accelerated by COVID and we’ll see fleeting developments that were induced by COVID but we’ll also see longer-lasting structural changes to behavior including home improvement in part due to migration from cities but mostly from remote work. Whether in a hybrid model or fully remote working from home is sticky and Home Depot loves it.

Home Depot One Supply Chain taking shape. In 2017 Home Depot announced a $1.2 billion dollar supply chain investment over five years with a goal to add approximately 150 logistics facilities in the U.S. to bring next-day delivery to 90% of Americans. During the company’s Q1 call EVP of Supply Chain and Product Development Mark Holifield gave an update on how the expansion is going.

Home Depot has a wide range of different facilities and it’s expanding each of them this year. Here are a few of the different facilities:

FDCs: Flatbed Delivery Centers — HD currently operates four flatbed delivery centers with plans to expand to 35 or so over the next few years. These facilities “are all about really driving share opportunities in lumber and building material-type categories big and bulky things” according to CEO Craig Menear.





MDOs: Market Delivery Operations — Home Depot currently runs 39 of these facilities and opened eight in Q1. HD is planning for roughly 100 of these facilities as “part of our overall plan to drive the fastest most efficient delivery in home improvement” Holifield said. These facilities are stockless and act as a delivery hub in a local area. Initially it is primarily appliances being delivered from these locations but the company plans to add more products as it learns.

MDCs: Market Delivery Centers — These are HD’s newest addition to the portfolio and it only operates two currently but plans for 20-ish eventually. These are “supportive of core business as well as the opportunity to accelerate growth in MRO (maintenance repair and operations)” said Menear. These centers are focused on distribution of MRO products and fast-turning store-based products.

What you’re seeing is a dominant leader in its industry not getting complacent and continuing to invest to improve service and expand categories. And its investments in both the physical and digital aspects of its supply chains are paying off. The headlines are touting Target’s store fulfillment numbers but Home Depot’s right behind fulfilling 55% of online orders from stores. This is particularly advantageous for Home Depot which sells goods that are more often heavier and bulkier than its retail counterparts.

TL;DR — The duration of extremely high demand for home improvement has been unbelievable. American’s can’t seem to get enough for their homes and the results are clearly visible in these results. Home Depot’s supply chain investments of the past several years have positioned it to seize this moment and capitalize on the demand. This time last year it saw its Pro customer demand dwindle as Americans delayed renovations but the company has posted four consecutive quarters of growth off the bottom and had its highest ever growth from Pro in Q1. It’s investing heavily to serve both its Pro and DIY segments with purpose-built facilities.

It’s omnichannel strategy is paying dividends as the company has boosted margins through higher store fulfillment. And it keeps bringing new services to market like the mixed cart feature that enables associates to more efficiently and effectively serve the total project needs for a customer as products from both the website and store can be added to a single transaction.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

This is the Bussink GT R SpeedLegend and it is essentially a Mercedes-AMG GT R Speedster.

The car is the brainchild of German product designer Roland A. Bussink and was inspired by the Mercedes-McLaren SLR Stirling Moss and Mercedes F1 cars. It also launches at a time when various other car manufacturers are releasing limited-run speedsters such as the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 the McLaren Elva and the Aston Martin V12 Speedster. Just five units are bound for the production line and each will be built by HWA AG.

Perhaps the first thing that will catch your eye is the Speedbow which stretches from just in front of the tiny windshield extends over the cabin and eventually connects to the rollover hoops behind the seats. The Speedbow which resembles the “halo” used in Formula 1 cars is made from carbon fiber and incorporates ambient lighting on its underside.

The GT R SpeedLegend also features a handful of other bespoke components including carbon fiber louvers on the front wheel arches. It is said to weigh 220 lbs (100 kg) less than a standard GT R Roadster and should be quite the performer.

In standard guise the 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 of the AMG GT R Roadster churns out 577 hp and 516 lb-ft (700 Nm) of torque. However thanks to a handful of modifications in the SpeedLegend it delivers 850 hp.

As mentioned just five units will be built and each will feature a bespoke paint scheme.

HP Elite Folio specs Price: $1889

CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen2

GPU: Qualcomm Adreno 690

RAM: 16GB

Storage: 256GB

Display: 13.5-inch 1920 x 1280-pixels

Battery: 16:21

Size: 11.75 x 9.03 x 0.63 in

Weight: 2.9 pounds

The HP Elite Folio is packed with innovative solution-solving tech — not gimmicks — that substantiates its $2000 price tag. It also gives the Energizer Bunny a run for its money; it lasted a jaw-dropping 16 hours and 21 minutes on a charge. I haven’t tested a laptop that offered a 16-hour runtime since the Samsung Galaxy Book Flex 15  so the Elite Folio’s vitality threw me for a loop.

Not only does the Elite Folio have the endurance of an Olympic champion but it breaks records like one too. The Elite Folio is the world’s first business convertible with a spectacular pull-forward mechanism. The feature lets you transform the display into a digital easel so you can get your Bob Ross on. The Elite Folio comes with an awesome stylus — a plus for users who have an affinity for digital note taking and doodling.

It may sound like I’m raving about the Elite Folio but the truth is it’s not for everyone. If you’re a professional content creator with an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription don’t bother — this Windows-on-ARM HP convertible won’t meet your high-performance needs.

HP makes it clear that the Elite Folio is for on-the-go business users who want a premium funky laptop that can manage all their light day-to-day tasks such as web browsing emailing and Zoom calls. You’re paying a premium for HP’s innovative display its compact form factor and integrated fast-charging stylus — not industry-leading performance.

HP Elite Folio pricing and configurations

The HP Elite Folio starts at $1786 and comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 CPU Qualcomm Adreno 690 graphics 8GB of RAM 256GB of NVMe storage and a 13.5-inch 1920 x 1280-pixel display.

My review unit costs $1889 which bumps the specs up to 16GB of RAM.

HP Elite Folio design

I took my first whiff of the Elite Folio and melted into olfactory heaven. “This smells so damn good!” I said. Wrapped in what HP calls “vegan leather” a fancy name for pleather the Elite Folio emanated that fresh new car smell that I love. Not only does the Elite Folio look premium but it smells like it too — like a wealthy businessman wearing earthy woody cologne.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

If you spotted an unopened Elite Folio lying around you’d never in a million years think it’s a laptop. It looks like an antique leather-bound journal filled with memoirs from your great-great grandfather but little do you know that technological marvels lie within.

The HP logo on the center of the lid is subdued allowing the onyx pleather-coated chassis to shine. Open the laptop and you’ll find ultra-narrow side bezels. Top bezel is slightly thicker to accommodate a 720p webcam. Its chin is thin sporting a miniature silver HP logo. Below the chin you’ll find a stylus sleeping soundly in its silo. Unfortunately you’ll have to awake it from its slumber when you blast the Bang & Olufsen speakers that flank the backlit keyboard.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

The deck mimics the onyx shade of the lid giving off a stern professional appearance. If you carry this laptop around people will know that you mean business. At first glance this HP laptop may seem traditional but there’s a whole fiesta hiding within the display which I’ll dive into later.

The Elite Folio weighing 2.9 pounds and measuring 0.6 inches of thickness is slightly heavier than its lightweight competitors: the LG Gram 14 2-in-1 (0.7 inches 2.5 pounds) and the Microsoft Surface Pro X (0.3 inches 1.7 pounds)

HP Elite Folio ports

The HP laptop has two USB 3.2 Type-C ports: one on the left and another on the right. Also on the right is a headset jack. Unfortunately the HP doesn’t have an SD card slot nor a USB Type-A port . The latter is understandable because the Elite Folio is too thin to accommodate thicker ports.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

The Elite Folio has a poor variety of ports so if you need more I/O options check out our best USB Type-C hubs and best laptop docking stations pages.

HP Elite Folio display

HP killed it with the Elite Folio’s innovative display . Although the 13.5-inch Elite Folio is compact HP maximized its screen real estate by offering a panel with a 3:2 aspect ratio. The display — serving up an 88% screen-to-body ratio — is more tall than wide so the Elite Folio doesn’t sacrifice display spaciousness for portability.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

I watched the Venom: Let There Be Carnage trailer on the Elite Folio’s 1920 x 1280 display and I was impressed with the detail. During a creepy close-up of actor Woody Harrelson I spotted the green veins behind his semi-transparent eyelids as he closed his eyes performatively. Tom Hardy’s tiny white chin hairs contrasted well with his scruffy black goatee. However the colors aren’t as punchy as I would have liked. A scene with Venom unleashing his beastly wrath lacked vividity. Most videos are optimized for 16:9 displays so keep in mind that you’ll often find some letterboxing on this screen.

The Elite Folio covers 71% of the DCI-P3 color gamut  which is less than the average premium laptop (84%). The Gram 14 (77%) and the Surface Pro X (74%) offer more coverage but not by much.

The Elite Folio outputting 390 nits outshone the average premium laptop (389 nits) on our brightness test by a hair. It also bested the Gram 14 (306 nits) however the Surface Pro X has the most brilliant display with 420 nits of brightness.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

The Elite Folio has a Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.25 (closer to 0 is better). This isn’t on par with the Surface Pro X (0.22) but it beats the average premium laptop (0.27) and the Gram 14 (0.3).

The HP convertible is also equipped with a snazzy touchscreen which responded quickly to my zippy gestures including pinch-to-zoom rapid-fire scrolling and swiping right to revisit previous pages.

HP Elite Folio pull-forward feature

The Elite Folio is the world’s first pull-forward business convertible laptop. So what exactly is the Elite Folio’s standout feature? Well you could detach the display from its traditional position and rest it in the middle of the deck optimizing the screen for streaming scribbling notes drawing and more. It’s a transformable easel right at your fingertips.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

The advantage of easel mode over other postures is that it gives you easy access to the touchpad. I launched Netflix’s The Start-Up in easel mode and for the first time ever I didn’t have anxiety about smudging the screen — I simply used the touchpad to replay shocking scenes turn on captions pause the show and more.

Elite Folio users who want to use easel mode should make sure that the display rests snugly in the magnetized space between the spacebar and the touchpad. If not they’ll find the screen to be too unstable while they’re sketching and jotting down notes.

It’s worth noting that transitioning the screen back to clamshell mode is an ungraceful awkward experience. Pushing it into position requires putting a lot of weight onto the device so you have to hold the laptop in place while the display scrapes past the keys and settles into clamshell mode.

You can also convert the Elite Folio into tablet mode. As I played around with this posture it helped me appreciate easel mode. Its titled angle similar to an artist’s canvas is the best position for digital drawing and note taking. I no longer have to hunch over a flat tablet to doodle like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

Still even in tablet mode the Elite Folio is superior to other convertibles on the market because it eliminates one of my biggest pet peeves: feeling those pesky exposed keys under my fingers.

HP Elite Folio pen

The Elite Folio comes with a stylus called the HP Elite Slim Active Pen which is nestled in a silo located above the function keys. HP also placed a nano SIM garage on the right side of the silo a useful feature for users who need reliable internet connection while they’re on-the-go. The Elite Folio is 5G compatible and equipped with Wi-Fi 6.

The stylus garage ensures that your pen stays charged while you’re not using it so whenever you’re ready to take notes or scribble you’ll know it’s powered up and ready to go. Even if you squander the battery life it can fast charge in just 30 minutes.

The Elite Slim Active Pen fits snugly between my pointer finger and thumb like it was tailor-made for me. It’s comfortable and ergonomic with its long flat design; it reminds me of Microsoft’s Surface Pro Slim Pen.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

As I played around with the pen on Whiteboard the pen strokes were smooth and seamless. There was virtually no lag. The Elite Slim Active Pen offers 4096 degrees of pressure sensitivity and uses Wacom’s AES 2.0 technology. The stylus’ buttons are all configurable via the Pen Settings app so you can have convenient access to your favorite functions.

HP Elite Folio audio

The Elite Folio is equipped with a Bang & Olufsen-tuned quad-speaker system. I tested them by blasting The Weeknd’s “Save Your Tears.” As the music turned up to max volume I was pleasantly surprised by its amplification. Don’t expect MacBook Pro -quality speakers though. The louder the song got the grittier it sounded. Unfortunately there’s no tuning software you can use to tweak the audio to your liking.

Still the Folio’s top-firing speakers are decent enough for an enjoyable Spotify jam session or a fun dive into Noise Cancelling podcast episodes.

HP Elite Folio keyboard and touchpad

Keep in mind that the 13.5-inch HP Elite Folio is a laptop designed for portability. If you have massive hands you may not feel comfortable with Elite Folio’s compact keyboard. (Check out our best 17-inch laptops page if you want something more spacious.) However if you commute often the Elite Folio sports a travel-friendly keyboard that won’t have your elbows brushing up against strangers on the train.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

I tapped away on the Elite Folio’s keyboard which has 1.3 millimeters of key travel. I can’t sing its praises enough. It’s got ultra-clicky keys and satisfying tactile feedback that I wasn’t expecting on such a compact device. On the 10FastFingers.com test I typed at 88 words per minute which is slightly higher than my 85-wpm average.

My typing experience was so fluid and rhythmic you’d think I had owned the Elite Folio for years. On top of that the keys are impressively quiet. If you’re hiding in a closet from a knife-wielding murderer — and all you have is the Elite Folio — you could email someone for help without betraying your location. If you prefer a less maniacal use case the Elite Folio is ideal for considerate office professionals who don’t want to disturb their fellow co-workers.

The 4.2 x 2.6-inch touchpad is just right: not too slick and not too resistant. Its coating felt plush against my fingers as I swiftly executed Windows 10 gestures  like pinch-to-zoom and two-finger scrolling.

HP Elite Folio performance

The Elite Folio is packed with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 chip  which has its pros and cons. On the plus side running Windows 10 on ARM offers jaw-dropping battery life that many Intel-equipped laptops can’t compete with. On the downside don’t expect top-of-the-line industry-leading performance with this SoC. Temper your expectations please.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

There are also some app compatibility issues because the Elite Folio runs on 32-bit Windows. Our lab tester couldn’t run our standard suite of tests including HDXPRT 4 and Handbrake. She also couldn’t run Sid Meier’s Civilization VI: Gathering Storm for graphics benchmarks. Bummer!

I tortured the Elite Folio with 30 Google Chrome tabs running content-heavy sites such as The Daily Mail. I fired up a new Google Doc to test the Elite Folio’s 16GB of RAM . As I began typing away there was a few seconds of lag but the HP eventually got with the program and kept up with my fast-moving fingers.

The Elite Folio with a score of 3115 didn’t snatch first place on the Geekbench 5 overall performance test but it didn’t fall dead last either. It lost to the average premium laptop (4063) and the Gram 14 (3286 Intel Core i7-10510U’s CPU) but it crushed the Surface Pro X (3077 Microsoft SQ2).

On the file-transfer test the HP’s 256GB SSD duplicated 25GB of multimedia files at a rate of 666.5 megabytes per second. That beats the average premium laptop (624.7 MBps) and the Surface Pro X (267.2 MBps 256GB SSD) but it couldn’t keep up with the Gram 14 (745.9 MBps 1TB SSD).

The Elite Folio is optimal for on-the-go business users with light productivity (e.g. internet browsing taking notes writing research papers communicating on Slack etc.). However if you’re a stickler for laptops that offer lightening-fast load times while juggling several CPU-heavy programs the Elite Folio isn’t for you.

HP Elite Folio battery life

The HP Elite Folio nearly snatched M1-based Apple MacBook Pro ’s fourth-place position on our laptops with the best battery life list. The MacBook Pro lasted 16 hours and 32 minutes and the Elite Folio was just 11 minutes short of that runtime.

On the Laptop Mag battery test which involves continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness the Elite Folio lasted 16 hours and 21 minutes. The Gram also did well on our battery test but it could not dethrone the Elite Folio with its 14-hour runtime. The Surface Pro X is the loser among the three; it tapped out after just 9 hours and 24 minutes. Womp womp.

HP Elite Folio webcam

The Elite Folio’s 720p webcam is housed on the top bezel and as expected there’s nothing special about it. Despite the vibrant hues in my testing room colors looked washed out on the camera. The picture quality also lacks detail and sharpness. On the plus side it picked up the delineation between my curls.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

Poor webcam quality is standard across the laptop industry so don’t think you can find a better camera on another notebook (except the Surface Pro X). The camera is fine for Zoom calls with friends and family but if you need a more professional-looking setup you’re better off buying an external webcam.

The HP Elite Folio heat

We tested the HP Elite Folio’s thermals on our heat test (15 minutes of a fullscreen HD video) and its underside can get a little toasty.

The touchpad (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and the center of the keyboard (92 degrees) hovered well below our 95-degree comfort threshold but the bottom — the hottest area of the HP laptop — climbed to 98 degrees.

HP Elite Folio software and warranty

The Elite Folio runs on Windows 10 Pro (32-bit). As mentioned Windows on ARM can’t run some of your favorite apps that are built for the 64-bit architecture. You can run 32-bit applications but you may experience a performance hit because they have to be emulated.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

Sifting through HP’s preinstalled software it’s light on bloatware . There are a few useful apps including HP’s QuickDrop which lets users instantly send files photos videos and URLs to other devices. You’ll also find a handful of familiar apps such as Your Phone Xbox Sticky Notes and OneNote .

The HP Elite Folio comes with a one-year limited warranty. See how HP fared on our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands special reports.

Bottom line

The question isn’t “Would I recommend the Elite Folio?” but “Who would I recommend this HP marvel to?”

The quintessential Elite Folio user is an on-the-go busy bee with light day-to-day tasks such as emailing web browsing and hosting Zoom calls. They get a kick out of all the “oohs and aahs” they get while using the pull-forward feature. On their off days they enjoy doodling and sketching while the HP device is in easel mode. They love that their pleather-bound laptop which looks like a large fancy journal can hide in plain sight. Most importantly they don’t have to worry about being tethered to an outlet because the Elite Folio can last for more than 16 hours on a charge.

HP is transparent about the fact that the Elite Folio is not a powerhouse laptop for graphics-intensive CPU-hogging activities. Its app incompatibility issues may be a dealbreaker for some prospective buyers. If you’re a professional content creator you’re better off checking out our best laptops for video editing and photo editing pages.

Still although the Elite Folio wasn’t No. 1 in our overall performance test its benchmark scores were just behind the first-place winner: the Intel-equipped LG Gram 14 . That isn’t half bad. Not to mention that it also crushed the Microsoft Surface Pro X by a landslide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9icmFidXMtdHJhbnNmb3Jtcy1tZXJjZWRlcy1hbWctZ2xlLWFuZC1nbHMtaW50by04MDAtaHAtc3VwZXItc3V2cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brabus Transforms Mercedes-AMG GLE And GLS Into 800-HP Super SUVs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9icmFidXMtdHJhbnNmb3Jtcy1tZXJjZWRlcy1hbWctZ2xlLWFuZC1nbHMtaW50by04MDAtaHAtc3VwZXItc3V2cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Tell Us About Yourself and Your Business. What Is Your Background? How Did You End Up Doing Mortgage Loans?

For as far back I can remember I loved numbers and figures. I excelled in Math during high school and determined to pursue a career in accounting as a CPA. My parents could not afford my tuition as they were retiring on a fixed income so I decided to work my way through college. I started a full-time position (executive bookkeeper) and two part-time positions (security officer at a major department store and a Dairy Queen) to pay for school. I attended community college due to lower costs and the flexible schedule I needed to keep working.

After finishing school I secured a position at an automotive dealership as a finance biller and after a few years I was promoted to finance manager. Working finance deals negotiating the best rates for clients preparing documents and ensuring customer satisfaction were all key to my success. While I was assisting a client one day he told me to consider utilizing my skills in the mortgage business. After some thought I realized that I was ready for another challenge in life so I made the move to a mortgage broker.

I received great training as an entry-level loan officer. A pivotal experience helped me realized I had chosen the right career for me. I was at a closing with a young couple I had assisted when they both hugged me the wife shedding tears of happiness. I felt so emotional and cried with her. That moment was 24 years ago and I will never forget it. My career was set! The overwhelming feeling of happiness of helping someone with their dream of homeownership will never leave me.

Why Did You Choose to Work for Huntington?

When mortgages started to get more competitive I thought it would be a more stable environment to work for a bank instead of a broker. Banks had lower fees and slightly more lenient underwriting portfolio lending and lower rates. I was lucky enough to find employment with a large Bank and after almost 14 years as one of their top producers in the country the bank decided to “outsource” to a broker. I did not want to work for a broker again and I knew Huntington had a physician program that would benefit my business since most of my clients were physicians. It just made sense to choose Huntington given my focus on physicians. Now almost all my clients are doctors!

Tell Us About Huntington’s Physician Mortgage Loan Products.

Huntington offers several programs which include the adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) products that amortize over a 30 year period and a 15 Year Fixed product. The ARM products are either 5 7 10 or 15 Year ARM’s which are enhanced with great rates for our physicians. The rate is fixed for either 5 7 10 or 15 years with adjustments for the last 15-25 years of the term. The rates tend to be lower than a traditional 30 year fixed mortgage. If you only intend to live in the home for 4 to 5 years (such as a long residency) why pay a 30 year fixed rate? The savings in interest with the lower ARM rates can add up fast! Most of my attending clients choose the 15 year ARM as it gives them the “extra incentive” to try and pay the loan off in 15 years by adding money to the principal each month. We are one of very few lenders that offer a 15 Year ARM product!

We require a 10% down payment for loans between $650000 and $1 Million but 0% down for anything less than $650000. Either way as a doctor you don't pay private mortgage insurance (PMI). Typically 30-45 days are required from application to closing. If your employment has not yet begun we do accept fully executed (signed) contracts in lieu of pay stubs. Some people wonder how our underwriters will treat your student loans. For residents and fellows we utilize a student loan calculator (similar to an IBR calculation) to qualify the mortgage loan. However for attending physicians if no payments are listed on the credit report we must use 1% of the outstanding student loan balances for qualification purposes.

Our “Doctors Only” Program is also available to dentists and veterinarians!

What States Do You Lend Physician Mortgages In?

Currently the Doctors Only Program is available in our “footprint” states. These states are Michigan Indiana Ohio West Virginia Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Illinois and Wisconsin will be added to our footprint sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.

What do you like and dislike about working with physicians and particularly with WCI readers?

There is absolutely nothing that I dislike about working with physicians! I love my doctors! The WCI readers are great clients as they come to me already “informed”. In the last few years with social media ablaze clients tend to be savvier about their finances. Working with a client that is in tune with their finances is helpful for me to assist them in their financial wants/needs/goals. I can more easily “customize” a mortgage option that will best suit them.

What Do You Like and Dislike About Working with Physicians and Particularly with WCI Readers?

The most common mistake is putting too much emphasis on rates/costs. Remember the sayings “You get what you pay for” and “Too good to be true”? These sayings have a lot of truth behind them. My best advice which I give daily is to work with a loan officer you feel comfortable with and someone who has a lot of experience in working with physicians. The loan officer you choose is a key factor in proper communication ensuring a smoother process and keeping your sanity.

In What Ways Should Physicians Seeking Mortgages Lower Their Expectations?

I wouldn’t say “lower” expectations. It’s good to have high expectations as long as they are realistic. Before I start the mortgage process I set realistic expectations for my clients. This includes timelines documentation requirements communication methods and closing requirements.

What Makes You a Physician Specialist When It Comes to Mortgages?

Besides the fact that I can honestly state that 95% or more of my clients are physicians? I’ve been working with physicians for over 19 years and have built long term relationships with not only the physicians themselves but many major health systems and medical groups as well. My network of physicians grows continuously each year and I can truly say that I don’t have “Banker Hours” – I have “Doctor Hours” – as I am always “on-call” 24/7.

Thank you Sandi Frith of Huntington Bank for your time and support of our mission to “help those who wear the white coat get a fair shake on Wall Street.”

What do you think? Have you used Huntington Bank for your mortgage? What was your experience like? How long of a term are you using for your mortgage? What questions do you have about the mortgage industry in general and Huntington Bank's “Dr Only” program in particular?

DDA board members discussed the Traverse Connect partnership at their Friday meeting where they also approved a contract for design services for reconstructing East Front Street and heard updates on plans to change the city’s sidewalk/platform café ordinance and seek development proposals for some downtown parking lots.

Traverse Connect

A contract for Traverse Connect to provide economic development job retention and business growth services to downtown for the last year ended up providing crucial support for the DDA and its members throughout the pandemic according to DDA CEO Jean Derenzy. The DDA plans to renew its $40000 contract for another year with Traverse Connect as part of its upcoming 2021-22 budget. Traverse Connect President and CEO Warren Call said his organization is seeing momentum starting to shift from constant conversations around COVID-19 restrictions and pandemic survival to calls with businesses entrepreneurs and talent seeking to relocate to Traverse City and said the next year calls for “bold experimentation” to help reinvigorate downtown.

Traverse Connect initiatives in the next year will include helping downtown develop a retail incubator complete a wages study and creating a survey of downtown vacancies and working to help fill those spaces according to both Derenzy and Call. Call said the vacancy survey would help the DDA understand where all its vacancies are downtown what kinds of spaces are available and the type of tenants the DDA hopes to attract to fill them. Call said the database would give the DDA “hard data” instead of anecdotal information about what’s available downtown. Derenzy said the DDA was specifically interested in recruiting second-story businesses to downtown particularly offices (which could include coworking spaces as office trends shift post-pandemic).

The analysis of local wages meanwhile will help the city see where the “pinch point” is between cost of living and salaries Call said. Traverse Connect will also help the DDA to develop guidelines and policies for a new retail incubator which could fill the “gap between a pop-up store and a permanent store and help the pipeline of great retail businesses” get established downtown he said. Call said Traverse City was receiving “national exposure” as an attractive place to do business and that it was “exciting” to see businesses and talent expressing interest in relocating to the area.

Also at Friday’s meeting…

> DDA board members approved a $419730 contract with Progressive AE for design and engineering services for the planned reconstruction of East Front Street between Grandview Parkway and Park Street. Derenzy noted that the next few years will feature heavy construction in downtown Traverse City including major bridge projects this and next year and then a state project to reconstruct Grandview Parkway from Garfield Avenue to Division Street in 2022-23. East Front Street will follow a project that will not only include street reconstruction but DDA collaboration with the state to redesign the “entrance” into downtown at the Grandview/Front intersection. The intersections of Grandview and Park Cass and Union streets could also be in line for future upgrades to enhance the areas where visitors first access downtown.

Progressive AE was one of eight firms that bid on the East Front Street design and engineering project and was selected from among four firms that were interviewed. Hubbell Roth & Clark will handle engineering for water/sewer design work. Other planned work in the project scope includes design work for nearby Park Street north of Front to better align pedestrian infrastructure with new bridge upgrades happening in that stretch and a traffic analysis for the downtown district that will evaluate impacts from the possible permanent conversion of State Street to a two-way state.

> Plans are moving forward to recruit proposals from developers to partner with the city on redeveloping one or more downtown parking lots into mixed-used buildings notably buildings that would offer workforce rental housing. Derenzy told DDA board members Friday that a city committee has already interviewed three developers about prospects for one of those lots: Lot G which is located next to Mode’s Bum Steer. Before issuing a formal request-for-proposals (RFP) to developers – which would specify what the city wants to see built on Lot G and allow developers to submit proposals for a project – Derenzy said the DDA first needs an answer on whether the parking lot will be needed for another purpose.

When the city struck a deal with TCF Financial Corporation to buy bank property across the street from Lot G to build the new Rotary Square part of the deal was contingent on relocating the bank to a new headquarters in a building the DDA would construct on Lot G. TCF has since merged with Huntington Bank and may no longer need the new headquarters; it could instead just outright sell its existing property to the DDA and consolidate its operations into another location. Derenzy expects a final answer on what direction the bank will go by next month which would then allow the DDA to explore other development options for Lot G if it’s not needed by the bank. City commissioners earlier this week also approved issuing a separate RFP to seek development proposals for Lot O which is located next to The Omelette Shoppe.

> Rule changes headed to city commissioners next month could allow for expanded use of restaurant sidewalk and platform cafes in downtown Traverse City. Sidewalk cafes utilize a portion of city sidewalks for outdoor seating while platform cafes utilize parking spaces for outdoor seating. Both can currently only operate during warm-weather months and Front Street business owners in the 100 and 200 blocks are banned from having platform cafes.

Derenzy said Friday that the pandemic illustrated the benefit of helping restaurants expand their outdoor seating. Accordingly the DDA is now proposing to allow sidewalk cafes year-round – which would be enclosed during the winter months – and to allow Front Street business owners to have platform cafes in the summer (they’d come down in the off-season). “We know (platform cafes) are successful and they should be allowed on Front Street” she said. If city commissioners approve the rule changes in June they could go into immediate effect for restaurants this summer.",,,,,,

After years of slowing (and occasionally declining) revenue growth Intel has its work cut out for it under new CEO Pat Gelsinger.

It's facing increased competition from AMD and Nvidia and more of its customers — including Apple Amazon and Google — are starting to make their own chips in-house rather than relying on Intel.

Meanwhile a global chip shortage has Intel and others scrambling to carve out the time and resources to build new factories also known as fabs.

Fritz has a history of posting super detailed die shots of all the latest chips in the tech segment.

Intel Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Delidded & Tested Shows All Individual Cores Working - Also Gets High-Res Die Photoshoot

The Rocket Lake CPU tested here is the Intel Core i5-11400 which packs 6 cores and 12 threads. The Core i5-11400 is regarded as one of the most budget-friendly chips within the Rocket Lake lineup & offers clock speeds of up to 4.40 GHz while featuring the brand new Cypress Cove architecture that delivers double-digit IPC gains to boost performance in games and general applications.

The Intel Core i5-11400 Rocket Lake Desktop CPU was tested while being delidded and without a heatsink. To get the chip to boot Fritz used a copper spacer which is needed to get to windows as during this time the CPU runs slightly hotter before reaching a lower power state. The thermal interface material over the die was cleaned off using Hydrochloric Acid but the solder TIM around the caps was hard to get off and that resulted in losing some non-essential caps (the CPU was still running fine without them).

After booting into the operating system the copper spacer was removed from the Intel Core i5-11400 Rocket Lake Desktop CPU. The chip was put under an infrared (thermal) cam & had clocks fixed to 800 MHz. That along with the limited TDP resulted in just 116 points in multi & 106 points in single-threaded tests within Cinebench R15. For comparison the stock Core i5-11400 scores 220 points in single-core and around 1600 points in multi-core tests within the same benchmark.

But the performance results gathered here aren't the most interesting information that Fritzchens posted. The thermal imaging part is the most interesting thing to see as it shows the multiple cores operating on the die. As load is transferred from one core to another the temperatures rise which looks amazing to see. Fritz has previously done this with the AMD Ryzen 4000 Renoir APU too on a laptop chip but this is the first time we are seeing a desktop chip in action.

While the Intel Rocket Lake Desktop CPU is no longer fit for general usage Fritz decided to go one step ahead and remove the entire die itself off the PCB interposer. We get a much better look at the Cypress Cove cores and the Rocket lake chip in general. The CPU features the same die as the flagship Core i9-11900K but out of the 8 cores two are disabled. There's also a tiny 'RKL Intel 2019' label which shows that Rocket Lake was initially conceived two years before its launch in the retail segment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi0gFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC8xNC1jb3JlLUFsZGVyLUxha2UtUC1wcm9jZXNzb3Itc3BsdXR0ZXJzLXRocm91Z2gtR2Vla2JlbmNoLXRlc3Qtd2l0aC10aGUtdXN1YWwtY3VyaW91cy1yZXN1bHRzLWJ1dC1yZXRhaW5zLXByb21pc2Utb2YtZ3JlYXQtdGhpbmdzLWZvci1JbnRlbC1zLTEwLW5tLWh5YnJpZC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLjU0MDQ5OS4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,14-core Alder Lake-P processor splutters through Geekbench test with the usual curious results but retains promise of ...,"An Alder Lake-P engineering sample has been spotted on Geekbench offering up a mixed bag of results that might not overawe anyone at the moment but does hint at greater things to come. The Intel Alder Lake hybrid chip utilized 14 cores and 20 threads for the benchmark run and it even threw out a clearly misread maximum frequency of 27.1 GHz.

4 Reviews

There have been a few Alder Lake-related leaks so far but it is still too early to try to pinpoint what performance levels we can expect from Intel’s 12th Gen hybrid processors. An Alder Lake-P sample which could be eventually heading to a mobile platform pulled out scores of 1287 points in the single-core test and 8950 points in the multi-core run in a recent Geekbench 5 appearance. Those aren’t terrible scores; in fact they are even greater than those recorded by a likely more-powerful 16-core Alder Lake-S SKU that we reported on back in December of last year.

The 14-core 20-thread Alder Lake-P chip at stepping level 0 (engineering sample) should be made up of six Golden Cove cores for high-performance operation and eight Gracemont cores for efficiency thus utilizing a hybrid architecture akin to Apple’s successful ARM-based M1 chip. As only the Golden Cove cores can take advantage of Hyper-Threading technology this explains the curious thread count: (6x2) + (8x1) = 20. The novel microarchitecture of the Intel Alder Lake chip will also explain the 27.1 GHz misreading for CPU maximum frequency. The base clock rate is recorded as 1.40 GHz.

Alder Lake at least at the moment doesn’t seem to be a generation aimed at those who just want the fastest CPU speeds and the quickest benchmark performances. Intel will be producing the chips based on its 10 nm Enhanced SuperFin process so there’s the promise of greater energy efficiency from Team Blue for a start. On top of that there is DDR5 support which is mentioned in the Geekbench listing for this 14-core Alder Lake-P sample. The hybrid chip series which is rumored to be coming in November will require new LGA 1700 motherboards for the desktop parts though.

As usual when getting my hands on a new processor family I was curious about the performance difference if booting the Xeon Platinum 8380 ""Ice Lake"" processors with the Spectre security mitigations disabled at run-time. Ultimately there was very little difference when using the standard ""mitigations=off"" option for these new Intel server processors.Intel 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable ""ice Lake"" processors are not affected by Meltdown MDS L1TF ITLB Multihit SRBDS or TAA but do still require kernel protections involving Spectre V1/V2/V4. Spectre V1 mitigation on the Ice Lake server CPUs involve usercopy/SWAPGS barriers and __user pointer sanitization Spectre V2 on these new CPUs involves enhanced IBRS (Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation) and conditional IBPB (Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier) and RSB (Return Stack Buffer) filling.

Booting the Linux kernel with the mitigations=off option allows disabling these relevant Spectre protections at boot-time albeit putting the system vulnerable. With recent generations of Intel processors since addressing Meltdown and co with hardware architecture changes has lessened the impact of running with these software mitigations disabled while now with Ice Lake Xeon there is almost no run-time difference. That's not to say there are no internal performance costs associated with their hardware/architectural mitigations but in terms of what can be still toggled by the user if so choosing is now almost zeroed out with these brand new server processors.When testing on the dual Xeon Platinum 8380 with Ubuntu 21.04 on a Linux 5.11 kernel booted by default/out-of-the-box with the relevant mitigations in place and then rebooting with ""mitigations=off"" to put the system in a vulnerable state but trying to juice out extra performance there was now almost no measurable difference.When running various workloads that in the past tended to show a difference with mitigations=off on the Ice Lake server processors there wasn't much of a difference at all.The side-by-side above just showing for the subset of workloads where there was even anything close to being noteworthy all the other data points not shown for their flat performance but can be viewed on the OpenBenchmarking.org link below. In a few Java workloads there were some small shifts but nothing like we've seen on prior generations of Intel CPUs or even when it comes to AMD processors with their Spectre mitigations.Those interested can see all the benchmark data on OpenBenchmarking.org but there isn't much in the way of a measurable difference of the workloads tested when toggling the software-controlled mitigations on new Ice Lake servers. Easily the least difference we've seen on modern x86_64 CPUs when running default vs. mitigations=off. Especially with production servers it is recommended to run the kernel in its default (mitigated) state for security while now these results show there is little to gain with these Ice Lake server processors from running with those controllable Spectre mitigations disabled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2ludGVsLWh5cGVyLXRocmVhZGluZy1leHBsYWluZWQtMTIyNjI3MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Hyper-Threading? Intel CPU multithreading explained,"Intel

Buying a CPU can be a bit of a task given the numerous options available. It gets even tougher when you try to decipher the technologies that these CPUs come with as CPU makers add in a lot of different technologies to make their chips perform better. For the average consumer these technologies can be hard to make sense of at times. One such technology is Intel’s Hyper-Threading Technology.

Intel first introduced Hyper-Threading in 2002. They kick-started it with its Xeon lineup of processors. However in the coming years Intel made Hyper-Threading a much more widely available feature. The best Intel CPUs today still come with Hyper-Threading and it has become a feature to look out for before buying an Intel CPU. So what exactly is Hyper-Threading? Let’s break it down. Also read: Arm vs x86: Instruction sets architecture and all key differences explained

What is multithreading? To understand Intel’s Hyper-Threading Technology you will need to first understand multithreading. Let’s start with the basics. The programs that run on your computer essentially are a set of instructions that a CPU interprets and runs. When you start a program these instructions make their way to the CPU. Typically the CPU executes only one channel of instructions at once. The completion of an individual instruction like this is called a clock cycle. A processor’s clock speed is actually a measure of how many clock cycles it can go through in a second.

CPU cores are actual physical units that work as individual CPUs. So if you have a quad-core CPU it has four physical units inside it that function like individual CPUs and share some resources. This allows the CPU to run four channels of instructions at once increasing the efficiency of your computer.

The word “Threads” has two meanings that are quite close to each other. A software thread is the channel of instructions that we mentioned before. With a hardware thread it’s the virtual equivalent of a CPU core. A hardware thread is thus an individual unit that can handle a software thread. With multiple hardware threads each core can handle more than one software thread at a time which is called multithreading. Also see: Single-core vs multi-core processors: Which are better for smartphones?

What is Hyper-Threading?

Multithreading can be leveraged to work even more efficiently in computers with superscalar processors. These are CPUs that can process multiple instructions per clock cycle. In such CPUs more than one thread can be executed at any stage of the clock cycle. This is called simultaneous multithreading (SMT). In contrast to SMT there is temporal multithreading which can only execute one thread at a time in a given stage in the clock cycle. This is mostly implemented for scalar processors.

So what is Hyper-Threading? It’s Intel’s branding for its implementation of simultaneous multithreading in its CPUs. An Intel CPU that supports Hyper-Threading Technology can perform multithreading simultaneously. With Hyper-Threading enabled hardware threads appear as separate cores to the operating system. The operating system thus serves one software thread to every hardware thread. This increases efficiency by ensuring the CPU takes advantage of the idle time by putting the resting cores to work.

Supported Intel CPUs have Hyper-Threading Technology enabled by default. You can disable or enable it in the BIOS settings.

Do you need Hyper-Threading?

Intel

Hyper-Threading is a great feature to get more out of your CPU. It makes the CPU perform like more than just the sum of its physical cores. Of course this depends on the kind of workload that you throw at the CPU. If the workload consists of processes that have threads that can’t run parallel Hyper-Threading won’t make much of a difference.

Hyper-Threading is beneficial when the workload requires heavy processing of tasks that can be carried out in parallel. In such cases the workload gets broken down into software threads that the operating system can assign to the hardware threads and execute them simultaneously. Hyper-Threading can help with heavy multitasking and CPU-intensive tasks like graphics rendering video editing and even gaming.

Intel’s brand of SMT or Hyper-Threading is nothing exclusive. AMD also uses SMT for its Ryzen processors. You won’t really be missing out on anything if you pick an SMT-enabled AMD CPU over an Intel CPU that supports Hyper-Threading Technology. See also: AMD vs Intel: Which one is better?

Is Hyper-Threading better than having more cores? Simply put no. Hyper-Threading offers a bit of an advantage over CPUs without it. It creates virtual CPU cores that the operating system treats like they’re the real deal. However in actuality they’re not quite the real deal. Intel’s figures say you get up to a 30% performance boost in server applications. To the end-user this number is likely to be lower.

Having more cores will directly translate to more headroom for performance. Hyper-Threading doesn’t come close to offering the same level of performance that an extra physical core on an equivalent processor would. It’s a nice added boost but it is not a replacement for having more cores and you shouldn’t consider it so.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed.

G. Arya*

China has on 21 May published yet another White Paper on Tibet “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation Development and Prosperity”1. It says “On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of Tibet’s peaceful liberation we are publishing this white paper to review Tibet’s history and achievements and present a true and panoramic picture of the new socialist Tibet.”

It has claimed Tibet as being part of China since ancient times and how through the signing of the 17-Point Agreement Tibet was liberated from foreign imperialists and feudal theocratic serfdom. It has claimed regional autonomy democracy development and religious and cultural freedom for all these 70 years. This is yet another blatant Chinese propaganda to mislead the international community and distort the historical reality.

May 23 2021 marks the 70th anniversary of the controversial 17-Point Agreement between Tibet and China. It was expected that China would once again flaunt this document to brag about the unification of Tibet with the motherland. But this time they came with a white paper on the Agreement. Chinese claims are nothing new; these claims were well rebutted in the DIIR’s publications “Tibet was never a part of China but the Middle Way Approach remains a viable solution”.

This time China’s white paper greatly relied on the 17-Point Agreement to justify its occupation of Tibet. So let us review the Agreement and see if China’s claims are justified or not. We also request the CCP leadership to look at this forced Agreement more to resolve the Tibet issue rather than celebrate it as a victory.

The 17-Point Agreement is a very important valid historical document that reveals the real nature of Sino-Tibetan relations at that crucial turning point of the Tibetan history of independence. Although forced upon the Tibetan government by communist China it remains an important testimony to the fact that Tibet was never a part of China before the Agreement.

From the historical perspective it is very important to assert here that Tibet has never been a part of China anywhere in its pre-1949 history2. Yes the Mongolian Nepalese Chinese and British army did enter Tibet and exercised suzerainty over Tibet at a certain period of Tibetan history. But they came as foreign entities as invaders or at the request of the Tibetan government and they left when their missions were accomplished. China cannot claim Tibet because of these historical skirmish incidents. If they did others could also do the same for that matter; even Tibet can claim China as a part of Tibet3. These skirmish incidents are natural and in conformity with the political history of almost all nations around the world.

Communist China has tried to claim Tibet as a part of China under various insubstantial grounds. But like most of its concocted propaganda the nature of the claims kept changing. First they claimed Tibet as a part of China since the 7th century Tibetan emperor Srongtsan Gampo [Tib: Srong btsan sgampo] when the Tang Princess Wencheng Kungchu became one of the queens of Tibet. Later the Chinese White Paper4 claimed that they inherited Tibet from the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty in the 14th century and later from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. But these fictitious and deceptive claims intended to distort history were refuted strongly even by the Chinese scholars5.

The fact is that even after the 70 years of occupation of Tibet China has not been able to fully win or defeat the Tibetans. When all the historical claims and propaganda failed to justify their occupation of Tibet China has now started to harp on “Liberation of Tibet from feudal serfdom” and bringing development in the region.

Many believe that the 17-Point Agreement with China was the end of Tibetan independence. No in fact the 17-Point Agreement is an important document to prove that Tibet has been an independent nation. The Agreement is also a testimony to the fact that China agreed for “one country two systems” formula for Tibet. The nature and the outcome of the Agreement also reveal the real imperialistic color of Chinese communism. Although the Agreement was signed under duress His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government tried their best to accommodate the Chinese demand. When China got confident that the land was fully under the control of its People Liberation Army (PLA) they began to violate the Agreement. This is how China under the communist regime works. Hong Kong and Taiwan should learn from this Tibetan experience and be wary of Chinese overtures6.

China first proposed and later imposed the contents of the 17-Point Agreement on the Tibetans. Tibetans refuted the Agreement at first and later tried to accommodate it but when China violated the Agreement which they themselves imposed Tibetans revolted and refuted it again. But China is celebrating it; herein lies the irony of the Agreement!

Now in order to resolve the Sino-Tibetan issue His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Administration in exile have proposed solutions in the form of a Five-point peace plan in 1987 Strasbourg proposal in 1988 and the Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy in 2008. These three proposals can be seen as the three-core Tibetan approach to resolve the Tibet issue. It shares many common elements with the 17-point Agreement7 Premier Deng Xiaoping’s statement8 and the Chinese constitution9 the three-core Chinese approach.

The 17-Point Agreement although signed under duress it gave China the much-needed excuse to get into Tibet. When His Holiness the Dalai Lama refuted it on April 1959 at Tezpur in India10 the International community came to know the truth about the Agreement and China lost the legitimacy to occupy Tibet. So from the point of International law China’s occupation of Tibet is illegal11. As a rising superpower and as an important member of the United Nations China needs to redress this historical faux pas to gain moral and international legitimacy to its claim on Tibet. Through intimidation and brutal occupation China has achieved all the points mentioned in the 17-Point Agreement. If China is serious about resolving the Tibet issue it sincerely needs to brood over those points which it agreed to give to Tibet but never did they are:

The 3rdpoint of the Agreement: “The Tibetan people have the rights to exercise national regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People’s Government.”

The 4th point: “The central authorities will not alter the existing political system in Tibet. The central authorities also will not alter the established status functions and powers of the Dalai Lama. Officials of various ranks shall hold office as usual.”

The 7th point: “The religious beliefs customs and habits of the Tibetan people shall be respected and lama monasteries shall be protected..”

The 11th point: “The local government of Tibet should carry out reforms of its own accord and demands for reforms raised by the people shall be settled by means of consultation with the leading personnel of Tibet.”

These four points which China promised Tibet are still not fulfilled rather China has violated them.

The Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan people submitted to the Chinese leadership in 2008 should be studied in this context. To what extent the Memorandum has deviated from the three-core Chinese approaches. More importantly it should be studied whether the Memorandum is within the purview of the Chinese constitution or not if not to what extent it has digressed. These are the common grounds on which Tibet and China need to discuss and negotiate to arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement.

Much to the chagrin of communist China the 17-Point Agreement of 1951 still remains an important document to prove that Tibet was an independent nation before the Chinese invasion. However as the Tibetans are not seeking separation from China now the document can play a crucial role in finding common ground based on the Middle Way Approach of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Administration in exile. The three-core approaches of Tibet and China could be the Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA) where the solution to the Tibet issue could be found. A strong will and sincere effort from the Chinese leadership to brood over the ZOPA sphere would be more mutually beneficial rather than harping on the immoral victory it contrived through the 17-Point Agreement.

23rd May should be a day for the Chinese leadership to look back and see what it promised to the Tibetans and what it really delivered and how it still could help find a common ground to resolve the Tibet issue. Therefore the Chinese leadership instead of making false claims should seriously study and reflect on its conduct to see if they have really delivered the promises it made to the Tibetans.

In the international context this Agreement is a living testimony to how China views the promises it makes. It also shows how the international community’s silence on the violation of the Agreement emboldened the CCP leadership to go on violating the agreements it made thereafter.

A recent panel discussion organized by the Geneva Tibet Bureau on the “17-Point Agreement and the 70 Years of Oppression in Tibet” by high-level international panellists has more on this subject12.

In 1954 China signed Panchsheel Agreement with India in which peaceful co-existence and non-aggression into one another’s territories were agreed upon but in 1962 China attacked India. Just a few years ago in 2017 China intruded India and Bhutan’s territories through Doklam incident. Last year China made illegal aggression into the Indian territories of Ladakh.

China and the British government had issued a Joint Declaration in 198413 in which a high degree of autonomy was agreed to Hong Kong after the takeover in 1997. Clause 3 of the Joint Declaration details the privileges that Hong Kong will have. But we have all seen last year what has happened in Hong Kong and what is the situation right now?

This is what exactly happened in Tibet 70-years ago. It was not liberation development and prosperity as China claims; it was 70 long years of repression deprivation and discrimination. If China is serious about the claims it has made in the white paper it should let the UN mission diplomats and media visit Tibet and confirm the situation.

Yesterday`s Tibet is today`s Hong Kong; if we let Tibet and Hong Kong go like this it will soon be Taiwan Spratly Island of the South China Sea Senkaku Island and so on!

It probably wasn’t the first time this particular bear had been in the backyard — a metal hopper-style bird feeder left out overnight by mistake a couple weeks earlier had ended up on the ground one side’s perches twisted beyond use the handle warped into a cone shape and the metal hook it was on pulled from aiming skyward to toward the ground and almost broken off from the deck post.

But the Mother’s Day bear was the first brazen enough — or hungry enough — to make a daytime appearance crouching underneath the platform feeders to scoop up fallen sunflower seeds. My mom rapping on the glass from the window seat got it to retreat but it lingered long enough to capture several images on both her cell phone and the trail camera in the yard. She was able to drive it off and bring in the bird buffet of grape jelly oranges nectar feeders and most importantly suet.

Bear activity definitely is up in the Upper Peninsula home to roughly 80 to 85% of Michigan’s black bears said Cody Norton large carnivore specialist with the state Department of Natural Resources.

Michigan’s bear population generally has been rising over the past decade with the most recent estimated count in 2019 at 9900 not including cubs up 16% from 2012.

In the past few weeks “definitely it’s been rampant up and around the U.P.” Norton said.

While most bears emerge from hibernation in mid-April it takes awhile for them to get the metabolism back up after months of sleeping Norton said.

But once fully roused bears need calories. Yet natural foods usually haven’t grown or become available enough to put the pounds back on Norton explained.

Bird feeders stocked with black oil sunflower seeds or peanuts offer protein and fat. Add tasty chunks of rendered beef tallow laced with seeds or peanut butter and well who can blame the bear?

“That’s what our nuisance calls are — people having attractants” Norton said.

If a bear plunders feeders Norton normally recommends removing everything for at least a couple of weeks so the bear doesn’t come to consider it a reliable food source. While bears don’t have territories they do patrol a home range — 10 square miles for females 77 square miles for males — so likely will return in time Norton said.

If you decide it’s safe to resume feeding only put out feeders that can be taken in each evening as most bears come in after dark.

The other main draws for bears are garbage and grills. Consider your own reaction to the scent of grilling meat. Then keep in mind a bear has a much more sensitive nose. Any drippings and scraps left after grilling out can lure them in so Norton recommends thoroughly cleaning the grill after use.

As to garbage storing all refuse in a sturdy building until it can be picked up or otherwise disposed of off-site is essential. Cans probably won’t thwart a determined bear unless enclosed in some way. And even sheds outbuildings and porches can be vulnerable if they have a window the bear can pop off and wriggle through.

For those getting into the growing hobbies of keeping chickens or bees — another major source of bear nuisance complaints — Norton strongly suggests electronic fencing around the coop or hives to deter bear break-ins.

The good news is the bears rarely are a real danger to humans. Most bears flee when confronted as long as they aren’t cornered and have an escape route Norton said.

The other good news is as May stretches into June the natural foods should increase making them less motivated to risk coming up to human habitation to raid the feeders. Though that’s no guarantee they’ll not stop by occasionally to check out what’s available.

“They’re kind of masters of taking advantage of different food sources” Norton said.

The bad news is come June through mid-July the sows that have yearling cubs will start looking for mates for the next batch — and send their juveniles out to fend for themselves. It’ll likely trigger another round of complaints this time from young bears looking for an easy meal.

If a bear becomes a true nuisance the DNR can step in to look at relocation or hazing but that’s usually a last resort Norton said. Instead he recommends those who have bear problems contact their local DNR office — for Dickinson and Iron counties it’s primarily the Crystal Falls site at 906-875-6622 — so a report can be filed to better document bear activity in the region see if a pattern has developed and whether it might be one rogue bear or multiple.

The DNR also can have someone visit the location to help determine what steps can be taken to discourage the bear from coming back Norton said.

With talk of war in the air it is one of national security.

If Australia were to cut supplies off now for example the construction sector in China the core of the economy would struggle to stay afloat.

China is pushing Brazil Australia’s main iron ore competitor to get back online after accidents and COVID-19-related shutdowns. A much-touted mine in west Africa considered to be years away is being accelerated.

The 110-kilometre Simandou mountain range in Guinea is one of the best medium- to long-term solutions to reduce dependency on Australia and is widely regarded to be the highest-quality iron ore still untapped in the world.

The Simandou mountain range in Guinea offers high-quality iron ore but it is a risky project. Rio Tinto

Despite the huge risks in the project which requires the construction of a 650-kilometre double-track railway with dozens of bridges and purpose-built tunnels and then a huge wharf Beijing is backing its development.

In its draft five-year plan published in early 2021 the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology elevated resource security to one of the six top strategic priorities alongside long-standing objectives such as innovation and productivity.

The draft policy is explicit in stating the need to diversify both production and supply chains of key industrial ingredients such as iron ore manganese and chromium.

The ministry set goals for greater self-sufficiency in iron ore supplies increased use of scrap steel and the construction of one to two competitive Chinese-owned iron ore mines overseas.

The government doesn’t just have Guinea in mind. In official government documents so far unreported in Australia the ministry’s draft which acts as the government’s definitive policy planning document also calls for building ties with iron ore miners in Russia Myanmar Kazakhstan and Mongolia.

A Chinese mine in Western Australia which is not named in the document but which is presumably the Citic-owned Sino-Iron project is also singled out as a preferred source of the resource.

The ministry envisages a China Inc-style approach to build alternative suppliers with steel makers resources companies banks and transport companies all encouraged to form consortia to explore projects abroad.

The National Development and Reform Commission the chief economic co-ordination ministry re-emphasised the policies this week saying it would step up local production and encourage steel makers to get their iron ore from elsewhere.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang convened a meeting of the cabinet this week to look at ways to get commodity prices down. AP

Longer-term options though are just that and an acknowledgement that China is years away from being able to wean itself off substantial reliance on Australia for iron ore.

In the short-term Beijing has already begun in recent weeks jawboning rising commodities prices down by threatening steel market participants with punishment for speculation.

Before prices began to fall last week domestic iron ore futures were up 34 per cent this year according to Gavekal an economic research consultancy steel and coal were up 40 per cent and copper up 34 per cent.

Such increases not only potentially feed into inflation and property prices they also interfere with a host of policies being rolled out to cap China’s carbon emissions by 2030.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang convened a meeting of the cabinet this week to look at ways to get commodity prices down. Among other measures the government increased export tariffs for steel products and cut import tariffs on scrap metal to zero.

China has a suite of other options to hurt Australia and cut into the profits of the big mining companies BHP Rio and Fortescue. All of them however carry big risks.

Beijing could for example go back to the future in the way that prices are set by reinstating the system the Japanese used when they were the dominant buyer of Australian iron ore.

Under this system Beijing would appoint a single company in all likelihood the giant Baowu Steel Group to negotiate on behalf of the industry in theory using China’s buying power to drive prices down.

Such a system would be difficult to manage because the Chinese steel industry is so vast and hyper-competitive with dispersed and complex buying interests. (China makes about 1.2 billion tonnes of steel a year; Japan in its heyday made about 100 million tonnes.)

It also might not work. In the final years of the old contract system in 2010 and 2011 prices nearly doubled as Chinese buyers scrambled to obtain supplies as demand rose and supply tightened much as is happening today.

A second option is to claw back some profits flowing to Australia through an antitrust action launched by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). The charge would be some form of concerted pricing in which different companies are alleged to mimic the pricing practices of their competitors.

China and Australia are in a kind of multi-scrotum clutch on iron ore. They are not going to hurt us. We are not going to hurt them. — Unnamed Australian mining executive

Politically it matters little in China that prices are set not by the companies but in the market. “It’s not hard for them to find an excuse even if BHP and Rio are lilywhite” says Allan Fels the former head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission who also advised the Chinese on their anti-monopoly laws.

The SAMR set up in 2018 as a super regulator with anti-monopoly powers has been flexing its muscles of late mainly against China’s big tech companies. In April Alibaba was fined a record $US2.8 billion for anti-competitive behaviour.

But an antitrust action contains risks too. Australia’s big miners don’t have any substantial assets in China itself which gives them some bargaining power. Beijing might also not want to draw the attention of the Chinese people to the iron ore trade and the huge profits it is generating down under when the official narrative is all about punishing Australia.

Finally the authorities in China could fine Australian producers for bringing into the market ores that don’t match to a tee what their contracts prescribe. With Australian mines running full bore it wouldn’t be hard to find a shipment with problems however superficial.

None of these options would reduce China’s reliance on Australian iron ore in the short term but they could punish the miners financially and cut into their profits.

It is also worth noting that China’s complaints – about high prices market manipulation and Australian perfidy – have been the same for about 15 years. “The Chinese don’t trust markets especially ones they don’t control themselves” says one mining executive with extensive China experience.

Likewise Australia’s geographic and geological advantages won’t go away. “You can’t tow west Africa or Brazil any closer to China” says the executive.

Still that Beijing is even contemplating punitive action underlines how seriously the bilateral relationship has deteriorated and how distant the two countries are from the origin story of co-operation on iron ore.

In 1985 Bob Hawke and the then head of the Communist Party Hu Yaobang travelled together to iron-rich Mount Channar in Western Australia to launch the trade.

“I am standing on a mountain of iron” said the ebullient Hu once on site according to Richard Rigby who was acting as their interpreter. In the car from the airport in Perth after his arrival Hu sat with Hawke and insisted on holding his hand.

These days the way the two sides talk about the trade is very different. In 2019 speaking privately one of Australia’s most prominent mining executives used colourful language to illustrate how both countries needed each other.

“China and Australia are in a kind of multi-scrotum clutch on iron ore” he said. “They are not going to hurt us. We are not going to hurt them.”

For the time being that remains true. But once the pendulum swings back in Beijing’s favour China will want to make sure the windfall profits could disappear as quickly as possible.

David Foss: Thank you Vance. Good morning everyone. I’d like to begin today’s call by remembering Jack Henry Board member Laura Kelly who passed away unexpectedly on March 15. Laura served on our Board for over a decade and was a cherished colleague and friend to all who had the privilege of working with her. With over 30 years of experience in senior leadership roles she brought invaluable insights wisdom and financial expertise to our organization. Beyond her remarkable professional achievements Laura was known for her kindness generosity and unwavering dedication to making a positive impact. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to John and Jake and the rest of Laura’s family during this incredibly difficult time.

Let’s now transition to our quarterly results. We’re very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and overall business performance. As always I’d like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024 total revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 3% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a strong quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

We also had a solid quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release this was our best third quarter ever for sales bookings. During the quarter we inked 11 competitive core takeaways with one of them being a multibillion-dollar institution. For the year we’ve now signed six multibillion-dollar institutions topping last year’s full-year total of five. Additionally we signed seven deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We are seeing strong interest in our new Financial Crimes Defender solution with 11 new contracts in Q3. Additionally we signed 45 new contracts for our new Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for the Zelle FedNow and RTP payments networks that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time.

We continue to see success with our card processing solution signing 14 new card processing clients this quarter. Our Banno digital banking platform remains very popular with 69 new signings in Q3 including 37 contracts for Banno business. We now have over 11.6 million users live on Banno and we’re continuing to add approximately 200000 users per month. Even with our strong sales success in Q3 we continued to replenish our sales pipeline and keep it near an all-time high. As we look towards the end of our fiscal year we remain very optimistic about the industry the demand for our solutions our ability to deliver outstanding service and our long-term prospects for success. With that I’ll turn it over to Greg for more detail on our solutions and businesses.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you Dave. As some of you have seen we recently released the 2024 results from our Annual Strategy Benchmark survey. This survey offers insight into concerns opportunities and technology priorities from bank and credit union CEOs. The survey indicated that 80% of bank and credit union CEOs plan to increase technology spending over the next two years. Of those the largest segment 35% plan to increase investments between 6% and 10%. We also inquired where they plan to invest over the next two years. The top four areas for planned investment were fraud detection digital banking data analytics and automation all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions through our technology modernization strategy.

As previously announced we recently launched our cloud-native AI-powered Financial Crimes Defender fraud detection platform. We now have 16 clients live and another 175 clients in the implementation queue. In addition we announced in March the Financial Crimes Defender was named the best fraud prevention platform by fintech breakthrough an independent market intelligent organization. Dave mentioned earlier that we have more than 11.6 million registered users on our cloud-native Banno digital banking platform. We continue to see strong interest in our recently launched Banno business solution that provides a modern banking experience for small and medium-sized businesses. As of March 31st we had 124 clients live and about 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation.

In terms of data analytics we continue to make progress on our data broker and executive dashboard solutions. Both are part of the cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. Data broker which is currently in beta will eventually provide access to all of a client’s Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution we are developing an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help executives at our financial institutions make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize. Related to automation technology one new Jack Henry platform offering we haven’t spoken much about yet is our cloud-native online deposit and loan account opening solution.

This integrated solution will provide a seamless digital account opening experience for our clients that enables them to streamline processes automate workflows and better serve both retail and commercial loan clients. We plan to begin the beta phase with clients in early calendar year 2025. The survey also found that 96% of our clients plan to add payment services over the next two years. We continue to offer a full range of payment solutions in our pay center application as well as other areas of our payment groups. As of March 31st we had 312 clients using Zelle 275 clients using RTP the real-time payments network which represents 48% of the live RTP clients and 190 clients using FedNow representing 29% of the live FedNow clients. One final point on the survey findings.

They were consistent with what we heard from our clients at our Annual Strategic Initiative Symposium in late April. While financial institutions are concerned about the increasing cost of deposits and impact to interest margins there is a general feeling of optimism and less concerned about an economic slowdown this year versus what we heard a year ago. One topic we spent a lot of time discussing that the strategic initiative Symposium is artificial intelligence. We presented in detail Jack Henry’s framework for building the necessary guardrails education training use of acceptable tools et cetera. We continue to actively identify opportunities to leverage AI aiming to enhance client solutions and optimize internal process and work streams.

Incorporating AI into select client solutions like financial crimes defender data broker executive dashboard and Banno conversations is part of that strategy. We are approaching AI deployment thoughtfully ensuring it benefits our clients and associates and aligns with our commitment to data privacy protection and security. Our strategy ensures we are responsibly bold and balanced. It’s been about 18 months since our corporate rebranding initiative to retire the Symitar ProfitStars and Jack Henry banking brands as we now simply go-to-market as Jack Henry. As we said at that time uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry’s role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice one Jack Henry.

We recently received results from an independent brand study that showed that Jack Henry’s brand equity has increased by nine points in just 18 months. We specifically saw significant improvement with large regional financial institutions and millennials. This is important as we continue to execute on our strategy to provide innovative technology solutions to larger financial institutions beyond what we already provide today through both our payment and complementary groups. And millennials are a critical audience because they are taking on larger leadership roles at these financial institutions and having more influence and technology buyer decisions. Speaking of brand equity hopefully you all have seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 29th.

We believe the 2024 report is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we’ve been working on over the past year. This year’s report details how we are we’re supporting local communities with a focus on financial wellness through both our investments and innovative technology in a variety of philanthropic efforts. We also continue to further our commitment to valuing people with disabilities with the launch of a new associate-led business innovation group focused on awareness of visible and invisible disabilities. The report also highlights some of the public Best Places to Work recognition we received from organizations like Newsweek Computer World and USA Today. As part of our planned organizational changes we recently announced the promotion of Shannon McLaughlin who is currently President of Jack Henry Credit Union Solutions to Chief Operating Officer effective July 1st.

Shannon has been with Jack Henry for nine years but has close to 30 years working with both banks and credit unions and senior technology and operational roles. Shannon is a strategic visionary leader who has significantly contributed to our company’s overall success and we’ll continue to do so as the next Chief Operating Officer. I want to close by recognizing Dave for the exceptional job he has done as CEO over the past eight years. Under Dave’s leadership Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions. I also want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance. He has prepared me well as I step into the CEO role on July 1st and I’m honored to continue leading our company with an unwavering focus on our associates clients and shareholders.

With that I will turn it over to Mimi for more details on the numbers.

Mimi Carsley: Thank you Greg and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I’ll start with the details driving our third quarter and year-to-date results then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Q3 GAAP revenue increased 6% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7% a continuation of consistently solid performance and keeping us on track for a strong fiscal 2024. Year-to-date growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and stronger on non-GAAP at 8%. Deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 which we pre-released last week was down approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients.

Year-to-date deconversion revenue is $9.9 million $7.2 million less than the prior period. Now let’s look more closely at the details. GAAP services and support revenue increased 4% while non-GAAP increased a more robust 6%. Year-to-date the increase was 6% for GAAP and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Service and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for the year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has long been a key to double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue which is 43% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model.

We saw positive performance with 8% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date delivered 9% for both. Consistent with recent results drivers include positive demand for our digital solutions card processing other payment processing and other processing revenues. In closing out revenue commentary I would like to highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue which increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees. Next R&D increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter.

The increase is primarily due to cloud consumption costs net of capitalization. For the year-to-date R&D increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly on a GAAP basis SG&A rose 7% for the quarter and 8% on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to higher personnel costs. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased 23% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The primary GAAP differences are the $16.4 million in onetime related costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program. [indiscernible] in Q1 and prior period $7.4 million gain on asset sales. For non-GAAP the difference is primarily due to the higher personnel costs and absence of gain on sale of assets. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 30 basis points of increased non-GAAP margin which was 20.8%.

Non-GAAP margin benefited from focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce while retaining key talent. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.19 up 7%. Separating results into the 3 operating segments we’re pleased to see across the board positive performance. Our core segment revenue increased 8% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 216 basis points. We continue to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 124 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 121 basis points.

This was due to continuing growth in our EPS business and moderate card growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends and a slightly tough comp combined with the focused cost management. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 103 basis points of margin expansion. And finally complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 33 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 8% with 28 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date reflects digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Segment quarterly margins were impacted by moderate headwinds from direct support costs and license and fees. Let’s now turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation.

Year-to-date operating cash flow was $336 million $129 million increase over prior period. Excluding proceeds from the sale of assets free cash flow was $172 million significantly more than the $54 million last year. Our base case entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximately $29 million overpayment last fiscal year as well as improved cash tax outlook this fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to share value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 19%. Additionally I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year-to-date period including $20 million in share repurchase offsetting annual dilution $25 million in debt reduction and $116 million in dividends.

With three quarters of the year complete we’re nearing the conclusion of our fiscal year and therefore I’ll conclude with guidance changes. As you’re aware yesterday’s press release included updated fiscal 2024 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP metrics. As a reminder we filed an 8-K on August 3rd that described how starting in the current fiscal year we’re using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. While we reported third quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 we are reiterating our full year deconversion guidance of $16 million. We are reiterating both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth and expect non-GAAP growth to potentially have a bias towards the lower end of our 7.4% to 8.0% growth range.

Due to the continued positive operational results and a focus on cost management we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 45 to 50 basis points compared to the 35 to 40 basis points previously provided. The full-year tax rate estimate remains at 23.5%. Incorporating the noted positive update full-year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $5.15 to $5.19 per share from the previous guidance of $5.09 to $5.13 per share. As a reminder the guidance or deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue VEDIP severance-related costs and nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2024. Due to the better than initially anticipated cash tax payments improved margins and contributions from favorable net interest our full year guidance for free cash flow conversion has increased to 70% to 75% from the previous commentary of 60%.

In conclusion Q3 results reflected continued momentum of the strong execution we’ve seen thus far this year and we expect a solid finish for the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our diligent and dedicated associates that drove these strong results in Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. Before I turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. While I haven’t had the pleasure of working with Dave as long as others I cherished our time together. I want to thank Dave for giving me the opportunity to work for this amazing company for being so incredibly generous with his wisdom and support for so many small and meaningful pieces of guidance over the past two years.

He is a role model of service leadership and doing the right thing. We are fortunate to have him lead the Jack Henry Board and I look forward to this continued journey together. Dave?

David Foss: Well thank you Mimi. As you are all undoubtedly aware this marks my final earnings call as CEO before my transition to Executive Board Chair on July 1st. Reflecting on my career at Jack Henry this has been an incredibly humbling journey for me both personally and professionally. And I’m beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to lead this great company for the past eight years. As we move forward I have the utmost confidence in Greg and the rest of our exceptional team to sustain our reputation for great technology and service as well as our strong financial performance. I’ve cherished the opportunity to get to know all of you over the years and appreciate your insightful questions and thorough analysis.

I thank our investors for their trust in Jack Henry and our clients for allowing us to serve their needs. And lastly I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to our associates. It is their dedication and unwavering commitment to supporting our clients and each other that drives our success and makes this company special. With that we’ll open up the floor for questions. Alan if you would please open the line.

Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.

Kartik Mehta: Well Dave it’s been good talking to all these calls. We’ll miss speaking with you in the future at least on the calls anyways.

David Foss: Thank you Kartik.

Kartik Mehta: Dave I wanted to get your perspective on maybe just the backlog. I know Mimi you said as you’re expecting maybe the lower end of the non-GAAP revenue for fiscal ’24 and maybe backlog is a wrong word to use. But just your perspective on based on what the sales pipeline looks like and how good you feel about as we move forward the ability to predict revenue and maybe why the lower end of the guidance.

David Foss: So I’ll give you my perspective and then I’ll ask Mimi to comment. So first off I mentioned in the release and in my comments that this was a — the best sales quarter we’ve ever — best third quarter sales quarter we’ve ever had. And I also highlighted the fact that the sales pipeline has been replenished almost to that same record level that it was at last quarter. So as I see what’s going on in the sales pipeline but even more importantly as I see what’s happening here in the quarter that we’re in right now which of course we’re not here to announce I feel really bullish about the future opportunity as far as sales at Jack Henry and our ability to continue to deliver. So that’s a sales perspective. I’ll ask Mimi to go — oh did you want to say something.

Gregory Adelson: Well let me just add this. So I think the other thing is that we’ve had unbelievable sales success this year. But as we’ve highlighted many times the deals that we’re selling this year for the most part don’t actually become revenue opportunities until future years and future quarters. So I think part of this is yes there are some things that are in an implementation queue and we’re working through all those as we always do. But there isn’t really anything that is signaling anything other than hopefully future success based on what we’ve seen. So I just want to make sure that you understand that all of the sales success we’re seeing right now will be in future quarters.

Mimi Carsley: Yes. The only thing I would add Kartik is that we feel really good about all three operating segments revenue. The total revenue is still very much in line with our long-term algorithm and what we thought about at the beginning of the year. There is a part of our business that does relate to economic factors in U.S. [indiscernible] that’s the card business. So I think as we look out for the year we feel really confident about our ability to hit that range.

Kartik Mehta: Perfect. And then Greg just you talked about AI and maybe the opportunities in there. But I’m wondering for Jack Henry is there an opportunity for you to use it internally and could that lower cost? And if so is there an upfront cost that you’re dealing with in an effort to implement that?

Gregory Adelson: Yes it’s a great question Kartik. So the short answer is we are spending a lot of time on internal operational efficiency opportunities throughout our entire organization. In fact we most recently had a corporate leadership team meeting where each of the individual business units and nonoperating business units all presented their ideas for utilization of AI and specifically generative AI. And so we’re going through prioritization. We’ve done a really good job of spending time making sure that we’re focused on building the efficiencies first. Getting the learnings and all the other stuff. We’ve just approved a couple of utilizations for the Microsoft copilot for internal use and the GitHub codeveloper stuff for the developers — or copilot sorry.

And we’re actually in the process of going through all of those things and looking for ways that we can continue to build efficiency and effectiveness first as we’re actually doing some other things within some of our products that I announced as well.

Mimi Carsley: The only thing I would add on there as Greg said responsibly bold and balance is our approach and that covers both the usage as well as the investment. And so we’re using the internal existing policies and processes to prioritize to develop business cases to think about the benefits not — this isn’t just a curiosity. There has to be business cases. And so all of that will still sit within our planned budget and R&D and internal expense policies.

Kartik Mehta: Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi. Please go ahead.

Andrew Schmidt: Hi Dave Greg Mimi. Thanks for taking my questions. And Dave congrats again on the transition.

David Foss: Thank you.

Andrew Schmidt: Want to start on the margin front. Good performance here. Mimi maybe you could put a finer point on this. I know that there were some — you mentioned some operational efficiencies that drove this maybe some mix factors as well. But maybe a finer point on that. And then as we think about the go-forward margin trajectory it seems like you’re above this year kind of what you’ve outlined for the longer term. So how does this — this year’s margin performance kind of inform the view on the longer-term margin progression? Thanks a lot.

Mimi Carsley: You’re welcome. So Andrew I would say for this year it came down to strong execution operational focus it’s a bit of product mix as well but we’re being very diligent around headcount around spending for the year. There’s also some timing around products and how that amortization impacts us as well which is also something that we’re just going to be thoughtful about for next year. It’s really early still in our budget planning. Our teams are getting together and thinking about the prioritization I would say at this point still thinking about that long-term range we’ve given versus an elevated state but we’re always trying to deliver shareholder value. And so that’s going to always be a focus for us.

Andrew Schmidt: Perfect. And then maybe just digging into the average contract size of recent cohorts. I know the attach rates have gone up over the past few years but maybe you can put just a finer point in terms of what you’re seeing in terms of just a complementary product adoption and just average contract sizes perhaps recent periods versus maybe a year or two years ago. Thank you very much.

David Foss: Andrew it’s Dave. So one of the challenges in this whenever we have a conversation like this is there is no such thing as average when it comes to our contracts. You’re correct. The attach rates tend to be high with our core clients. But remember we sell a lot of solutions that are outside the core base and the variety of solutions that we sell roughly 300 different solutions. They range from very small ticket price to very large ticket price. Most of the solutions — almost everything we sell today is hosted. So it’s rare for us to sell a licensed version of a solution. Well then in the hosted contract or are they going to be hosted for three years or 10 years or so they’re trying to talk about average is pretty challenging.

The best indicator because we have used the same measurement approach for sales quota attainment for many years now the best measure is the fact that as I just mentioned Q3 was the best Q3 we’ve ever had. That’s the most significant indicator of sales success is the fact that — we’ve used the same way of measuring contracts for many years. And so it’s a good relative performance indicator for our sales organization. and sales overall are up. So I know it’s frustrating to not be able to talk about averages but it’s just really not a practical thing to try and do in our world.

Andrew Schmidt: No it makes sense yes. A lot of different shapes and sizes that they’re [indiscernible]. Congrats again Dave. Thank you very much.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you.

David Foss: Thank you.

Operator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Darrin Peller: Thanks. And Dave I want to — also my congrats as well. [indiscernible] so always appreciate the help. Guys maybe just start off on a free cash discussion. If we could just revisit it obviously has gone through its periods of strength above 80% and below 60%. Now you’re saying back to 70%-plus. Maybe just give us a sense a little more on what the driving factors are and the sustainability of it now and — maybe just help us understand if we’re back to 80% going forward in the next couple of years?

Mimi Carsley: Darrin it has been a bit of a roller coaster ride. And in part that was due to the lack of clarity from a legislative front. As we said on last quarter’s call we were hopeful the progress on Congress addressing the Section 174 R&D-related impact on cash taxes would go through — we were optimistic but not betting on that. But even in the absence of that the clarity that the treasury to IRS our outside consultants our incredible tax team here Jack Henry have had has really helped us from being able to discover savings from a cash tax perspective that impacted effectively last year a benefit so that would mean less cash tax paid this year. And so even if that legislation does not get fully addressed I think we’re in an improved position versus where we thought earlier in the year.

We’re still hopeful that it will be addressed. But that’s the biggest driver that represents over $29 million in last year’s impact alone let alone some additional for this year. So that’s a biggest impact for the free cash flow. And I think that’s a sustainable for the Dave board.

Darrin Peller: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks. Greg maybe just on your side if you just talk about what you’re seeing in the market more specifically around demand for core commercial use order. Obviously the cloud discussion we’ve had for some time now. Again just inflections you’re seeing for specific products or offerings or maybe vice versa anything that’s weaker? Any more color would be great. Thanks.

Gregory Adelson: Yes sure. So I think a couple of things as part of our survey and even just obviously with our regular conferences and conversations with our clients deposit growth continues to be a big driver. Operational efficiency continues to be. And that’s why we really highlighted some of those key products that we’re already focused on and fraud being a big one things that we’re already focused on and driving out in the market set and we’re continuing to see some nice pickup in all of those. So those continue to be big ones. I think related to the tech modernization and what we’re doing with our modules. We’re continuing to have a lot of success on the execution side of that. We’ll continue to talk more about that in future calls.

But right now we’re really excited about what we’ve done with data broker and executive dashboard. We think those are some products that really are not out there in the space today and we’ll continue to create an opportunity for us to show the advancement of what we’re doing in our cloud native technology and utilization of generative AI as part of that. So all of those will kind of tie in to what the demand has been around deposits fraud opportunities operational efficiency as the three big things.

Darrin Peller: Great. Thanks guys.

Operator: Our next question comes from Vasu Govil of KBW.

Vasundhara Govil: Hi thanks for taking my questions. I guess first quick one for Mimi. I know it’s a little too early to talk about the ’25 outlook but just based on the new sales momentum that you’ve had this year it seems like you’re setting up for stable if not accelerating revenue growth into next year. Any reason to think that may not be the case? And then Mimi if you could also specifically comment on the payment segment trending slightly softer than we would have thought just how it performed relative to internal expectations and what you’re expecting for the go-forward trend line there?

Mimi Carsley: So Vasu I wish I could tell you with more precision the next year targets but it’s just a little too early. We’re still during the budget process. But there’s no reason to have any other expectation than grow the algorithm at a high level. There are some things that present challenges each year from a grow-over perspective that even though we’re having tremendous success with the sales pipeline there’s lower convert merge that impacted this year. You just never know from a grow-over perspective. But I think the growth algorithm is a pretty good framework to think about for next year. As it relates to this year and the payments question I would say that that really — to categorize it we saw slower transaction growth broadly slower growth in debit."

The big question that remains unanswered: Will it be for the Mets or some minor league affiliate?

“Whether it’s going to be for us I’m going to say we hope so” manager Luis Rojas said before the Mets’ 6-5 12-inning win over the Marlins on Friday night. “But we want to see this day-to-day. We want to see how he feels and the feedback on how it’s going and then we can probably say ‘He’s pitching with us’ or ‘We want to go another way where we want to see another rehab start.’ ”

DeGrom who is on the injured list with right-side tightness struck out eight of nine batters he faced Thursday in a Single-A rehab start. He was throwing 102 miles per hour according to the opposing Palm Beach Cardinals’ Twitter account. Mets pitching coach Jeremy Hefner was in attendance.

“There wasn’t a real plan set” Rojas said. “It was more like 3-4 innings however he felt. He said his mechanics felt good throughout. He didn’t feel anything body-wise. Then he threw some more pitches in the bullpen.”

DeGrom arrived in Miami for treatment Friday and is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Sunday. Wasting their ace in the minors would seem like an odd choice for the Mets when they are extra-strapped for offense because of injuries.

“The only thing that will take us that way is if there is something he wants to feel” Rojas said. “Or something the medical staff wants him to achieve. That’s why we are going with the day-to-day approach. What we don’t want is what happened what got him on the IL over a week ago. If everything goes accordingly you may see him pitching in a big-league game on Tuesday.”

Rojas a former minor league manager can relate to how the Cardinals’ farmhands felt against deGrom.

“Opposing batters are always aggressive” Rojas said. “They want to get strike one. The guys at that level are excited they are facing big league pitchers. Jake had his best stuff. Some guys didn’t get hits but I have to think it was a great experience [for them] to face Jake the best pitcher in the game in the world.”

The Mets had not determined their starting pitchers for the final two games of the series even after Friday’s marathon win ended.

Rojas mentioned Jordan Yamamoto is in Miami from the taxi-squad and that Joey Lucchesi is “fresh” in the bullpen.

“We have guys who can go multiple innings to start a game and we had a bullpen game the other day — but we won that game” Rojas said. “We want to be in the best position we think to win a ball game.”

Overshadowed by Pete Alonso going on the IL on Friday reliever Tommy Hunter (lower back pain) also landed on the IL. Yennsy Diaz was recalled from Triple-A. Even the injury replacements are getting injured. Second baseman Jose Peraza left Friday’s game in the fourth inning with a right-calf contusion. His status for Saturday was not immediately known late Friday.

“It got all meat. Thank God no bone or anything” Rojas said. “He got tight really quick and was struggling to really walk because of the tightness. My recommendation to him was this is going to change your game: Your range is going to be limited your speed is going to be limited and maybe your hitting too.”"

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.""



On Wednesday afternoon a photo was captured of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson kissing quite passionately on the streets of New York where Pascal was seen in a tan blazer and a brown dress shirt while Johnson wore a leather jacket over a white tee. Naturally the image of the two locking lips went viral leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out it was all just a moment of movie magic.

The pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their new romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song—whose debut feature film Past Lives was nominated for Best Picture this year—the upcoming flick follows the dynamic between a matchmaker a wealthy man she meets and her ex. In addition to Johnson and Pascal the movie also stars Chris Evans Zoë Winters Dasha Nekrasova Louisa Jacobson and Marin Ireland.

Materialists just began filming in New York in late April according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.

To make matters even more interesting about a week ago Johnson was seen filming a scene with costar Evans and in a few paparazzi photos the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film to say the least.

Johnson is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones which costars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile Pascal has a lot on his plate as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico which just began filming in April.

But back to Johnson she’s not only a key person on my beauty vision board but her style game is also on point.

Spotted on the set of the romantic comedy Materialists Johnson donned a totally chic ensemble—essentially a variation of what I wear on a daily basis consisting of a versatile button-up shirt and oversized shoulder bag. But the magic happened on the lower half of her uniform showing off a nostalgic pair of jeans I honestly forgot about.

Johnson’s bootcut denim threw it back to my high school days boasting a light-washed hue that’s ideal for spring and summer. If you’ve been sleeping on bootcut pants it’s time to revive them. They’re some of the most flattering pants you can own since they’re fitted throughout the hips and thighs while featuring a leg-lengthening flare.

Johnson’s bottoms cascaded to the floor and dragged behind her but that’s customizable depending on your height and desired fit. Either way style your comeback jeans with a bodysuit or off-the-shoulder blouse for a sleek finish. I love pairing my bootcut denim with kitten heels for an added boost of height though sneakers are just as good—and Johnson proved it.

The actress slipped on a pair of comfortable Nike sneakers that included a grippy bottom and crawling toe cap. Her footwear nods to popular model-approved styles leaning into the chunky dad look that fashion has come to know and love. The sneaker style is super practical too given that it can be elevated by the above jeans or dressed down with workout shorts oversized T-shirts and maxi skirts.

Johnson is seemingly wearing a variation of the Waffle Debut Vintage Sneaker though Reebok Steve Madden and New Balance offer great lookalikes. The key is finding a style that includes the three staple elements: a grooved sole lace-up design and front toe detail. And of course they must be comfy!

One aspect of that confusion is that it barely seemed to have a comprehensible political dimension at all even though it culminated in a small-scale low-impact imitation of the U.S. Capitol riot of Jan. 6.

I'm talking about the brief and spectacular career of the European Super League which proposed to unite Europe's biggest soccer teams — by definition among the most valuable and successful sports franchises on the planet — in a closed-competition entity somewhat modeled on the NBA or Major League Baseball. This scheme had been hatched as a semi-open secret for several years by a coterie of billionaire team owners and was backed by financing from JPMorgan Chase in expectation of a record-breaking TV deal.

This small group of immensely wealthy men — and evidently all the toadies and financiers around them — believed this was a logical way to streamline and consolidate the awkward business structure of the world's most popular professional sport which at present is carved up into numerous national leagues and international cup competitions. On paper according to the logic that has driven global capitalism over the last several decades that was an entirely sensible conclusion. It apparently did not occur to them that their plan might run into significant public opposition probably because they simply hadn't noticed that the ground under their feet — rather under everyone's feet — had shifted dramatically in political ideological and cultural terms.

In any case in the annals of disastrous PR rollouts a new standard has been set: The Super League was announced with a late-night press release on April 18 and collapsed entirely three days later after widespread public protests and political blowback much of it from unlikely sources. (British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for example has not previously been seen as an enemy of Big Capital.) At least New Coke and the Edsel were products that managed to reach the marketplace. Team owners who briefly believed they had invented the Next Big Thing were left to eat crow on social media apologize to their fans and vow repentance to their domestic leagues and the sport's governing bodies. For whatever reason no one has bothered to shut down the Super League website  which stands as a digital Ozymandias monument to one of the great moments of hubris in recent history.

Two weeks after that a match between Manchester United and Liverpool — perhaps England's two most famous teams both involved in the Super League fiasco — had to be abandoned on May 2 after hundreds of protesters broke through security at Old Trafford United's historic stadium. In a startling minor-key echo of what had happened four months earlier in Washington the interlopers wandered around the stands and the field for a couple of hours setting off fireworks committing acts of minor vandalism and of course posting everything they did on Instagram. I suppose we can't claim this was a case of history repeating itself as farce since it had already been farce in the first instance.

Beyond some vague tut-tutting about the importance of peaceful protest — in this case it's actually true that a much larger crowd remained outside and did not break the law — the sports media had no idea how to describe what had happened or why. Although there was clearly some connection between the Super League debacle and the Old Trafford riot no one could quite explain what that was. Exactly what the Manchester United fans were angry about and what they hoped to accomplish — a great many of them were wearing the team's expensive merchandise even as they broke into its own stadium and trashed the place — is even less clear than in the case of the Capitol rioters who had a proximate (if completely unachievable) goal.

It's fair to say that United's widely-despised American owners the Glazer family of Florida — who also own the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers — were the principal targets. But as with the Capitol attack I think focusing too closely on the details is missing the point. Parochial impulses like anti-Americanism almost certainly played a role in Manchester and so perhaps did uglier ones like antisemitism. But trying to frame these events in terms of good and evil heroes and villains — depicting the Old Trafford invaders for example as a bunch of Little England bigots staging a micro-Brexit — is overly simplistic and amounts to deliberately avoiding the lesson history is trying to teach us.

I'm almost surprised in fact that we never saw an op-ed by a professional smart person announcing that the Super League scheme was in some sense historically and socially progressive and that its opponents were tiny backward people stuck in the past. I guess there simply wasn't time for that and in the current climate of public opinion taking the side of say Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi — respectively the owners of Chelsea and Manchester City who will play in the UEFA Champions League final next Saturday — against the unwashed rabble didn't seem worth it.

I guarantee there are professional smart people who feel that way perhaps more instinctively than intellectually which points us toward two important elements of that history lesson. The first of those is that such critics would be half right: Everyone is stuck in the past. We live in an age of permanent nostalgia when nearly everyone seems to believe they've lost something important but can't or won't say exactly what that is. But if the rioters at both Old Trafford and the U.S. Capitol were trying to recover something unrecoverable (and perhaps indescribable) so too are those of us in the educated classes who sit behind desks and deliver them lectures.

The second part of the lesson is that the world those professional smart people helped create and whose ideological and intellectual enforcers they have become is built on the premise that capitalism and democracy are inextricably linked. In the decades since the end of the Cold War they have assured us that those vaguely-defined terms of art had been bonded together in a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup of historical inevitability and would lead us sooner or later to the perfect society.

That has come back around not to put too fine a point on it and bitten them in the ass. Now that the perfect union of globalized capital and so-called liberal democracy looks like just as much of a delusion as the Marxist-Leninist permanent revolution ordinary people around the world have become deeply suspicious of both halves of the equation. It may be vaguely correct to say that the Capitol riot was an attack against democracy and the Old Trafford riot was a protest against capitalism and to claim that the first presented a dire threat with enduring consequences while the second was entirely symbolic and largely pointless.

But in the bigger historical picture I think we have to see them as two sides of the same coin. Both were explosions of incoherent popular or populist rage directed at the dominant liberal-capitalist order whose decades of hegemonic rule (whichever political parties were nominally in power) have produced worsening inequality — both on a global scale and within the affluent nations of the West — along with a widespread sense of political disenfranchisement and cultural dislocation.

If some of that outrage takes exceptionally unpleasant forms — an embrace of authoritarianism fascism or white supremacy for instance — while some of it appears more ""progressive"" or radical and a whole lot of it is ambiguous and difficult to define that should not be surprising to anyone familiar with the patterns of history.

Our reluctantly deposed ex-president and his followers have famously wrapped themselves in a threat or promise to make America great again a misty-eyed callback to some fantasy version of the 1950s with their supposedly unquestioned racial and sexual hierarchies intact. I don't need to waste time convincing you that nothing about that invented reactionary utopia — America as perceived by Donald Trump in childhood pretty much — resembles the actual history of the 1950s a transitional decade characterized by tremendous turmoil and change.

It's certainly possible that some of the Old Trafford rioters harbored an equally unsustainable fantasy about a vanished era of bloody turf early-morning pints and Players No. 6 cigarettes when Manchester United was in some sense a local or distinctively ""English"" team and its jerseys (today bearing the iconic logo of an American car) weren't found on teenage bodies in Shanghai and Cairo and suburban Chicago. It seems entirely plausible that there were racist or nativist undertones to the wave of protests that brought down the billionaires' dream of a Super League to rule them all. Make footy great again!

But as one of my mentors in journalism told me years ago not every story has a good guy and a bad guy and your first responsibility is to tell the truth not to take sides. For a great many people in the educated liberal classes of the Western world the entirety of the popular revolt against both capitalism and democracy seems incomprehensible and more than a little bit terrifying. That's because they also long for their own version of the vanished and largely imaginary past: the age of neoliberal triumphalism when it seemed obvious that the unified system of liberal democracy and global capitalism would rule everywhere and forever with people like them (OK like us) as its meritocratic elite.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHZwcm9maXQuY29tL2FtcC9wdXJzdWl0cy9vbndlYi9tZWF0cGFja2VyLW1hcmZyaWctc2Nvb3BzLXVwLWEtcXVhcnRlci1vZi1icmF6aWxpYW4tcml2YWwtYnJm0gFraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmR0dnByb2ZpdC5jb20vYW1wL3B1cnN1aXRzL29ud2ViL21lYXRwYWNrZXItbWFyZnJpZy1zY29vcHMtdXAtYS1xdWFydGVyLW9mLWJyYXppbGlhbi1yaXZhbC1icmY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meatpacker Marfrig Scoops Up a Quarter of Brazilian Rival BRF,"Brazilian beef producer Marfrig Global Foods SA bought about a quarter of rival BRF SA one of the world’s biggest poultry suppliers as it seeks to expand in processed food.

Marfrig purchased a 24.23% stake in BRF pledging to remain a passive investor that won’t influence the board or management according to a regulatory filing. It paid about $800 million according to a person familiar with the purchase who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public.

BRF shares jumped by a record 29% this week pushing its market to almost 22 billion reais ($4.1 billion). That still leaves it at little more than a third of its peak of more than 60 billion reais in 2015.

Trading volumes surged this week as a JPMorgan Chase & Co. brokerage unit dominated the buying with a net volume of about 48.2 million shares.

The Sao Paulo-based foodmakers started discussions on a merger in 2019 but the talks to create what would have become the world’s fourth-largest meat producer ended without a deal at that time.

Marfrig the second-largest beef producer saw net income surge to record levels last year. Flush with cash the company has been seeking opportunities to grow focusing on the processed-food segment in which BRF is a leading producer.

Marfrig’s founder and chairman Marcos Molina is the company’s largest shareholder with a stake of about 38%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC1jb25zdW1lci96YXJhLW93bmVyLWluZGl0ZXgtY2xvc2UtYWxsLXN0b3Jlcy12ZW5lenVlbGEtbG9jYWwtcGFydG5lci1zYXlzLTIwMjEtMDUtMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zara owner Inditex to close all stores in Venezuela local partner says,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/zara-owner-inditex-close-all-stores-venezuela-local-partner-says-2021-05-22/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC1jb25zdW1lci96YXJhLW93bmVyLWluZGl0ZXgtY2xvc2UtYWxsLXN0b3Jlcy12ZW5lenVlbGEtbG9jYWwtcGFydG5lci1zYXlzLTIwMjEtMDUtMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2UtY2F1c2VzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Is Hiring Hard Right Now?,"The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in the news.

In the past few weeks 22 states have announced they would end federal pandemic unemployment benefits which pay recipients $300 on top of state benefits and are scheduled to run into September. (New Hampshire is the latest.)

Many of the states’ governors all Republicans made statements similar to that of Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina who said the expanded benefits are “incentivizing and paying workers to stay at home rather than encouraging them to return to the workplace.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the same."

As a society we increasingly recognize the interconnectedness of nature and climate but have struggled to tackle these twin crises in a holistic manner. This is starting to change. As recently highlighted by COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma a key priority for COP26 taking place in November this year is to set enabling measures for communities and natural habitats to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

WBCSD members understand the urgency to address the nature and climate crises together. Our recently refreshed Vision 2050: Time to Transform provides a framework for business action in line with the urgency of the challenges that we face if 9 billion people are to live well within planetary boundaries by 2050. To move beyond business-as-usual into the accelerated transformations necessary business leaders must adopt three mindset shifts: reinventing capitalism that rewards true value creation; focusing on building long-term resilience; and taking a regenerative approach beyond doing no harm which builds the capacity of our social and natural ecosystems to heal and thrive.

While business are increasingly recognizing nature’s essential role in supporting human wellbeing and health we are still outstripping nature’s ability to supply the services on which we all depend.

These services commonly referred to as “ecosystem services” are benefits that we enjoy for “free” such as the provision of fresh water soil fertility crop pollination flood regulation and maintaining a stable climate. Without healthy functioning ecosystems the ability of nature to provide these services is impaired or reduced with disastrous negative consequences for human wellbeing and our societies. Scientists have been sounding the alarm for some time. In 2019 IPBES published a comprehensive assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and found that nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history. The Final Dasgupta Review also showed that we need to ensure that our global economy embeds nature into decision-making since our economies are a subsidiary of nature not the other way around.

The 2019 IPBES report also showed that climate change and biodiversity loss are intrinsically linked. The report identifies climate change as the third major driver of nature loss by order of impact. In turn the loss of nature and the unsustainable use and management of natural resources is the second largest source of carbon emissions and a key driver of climate change.

Nature can provide up to 30% of the climate mitigation that we need by 2030 but it only receives around 8% of public funding. If we had the same level of investment in nature that we have in renewable energy we would have achieved significant progress towards global climate goals and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets: reducing nature loss and the severity of the climate emergency we face. To avoid dangerous irreversible climate change we must reach net-zero emissions before 2050 and become nature-positive by 2030. The longer we delay action the more complex and costly the impacts will be to mitigate and adapt to with disastrous effects on people and planet.

Business can play a critical role in accelerating climate recovery and revering nature loss. Nature-based and Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) which sequester carbon from the atmosphere are fundamental to building true climate resilience and need to occur in tandem with rapid decarbonization of the global economy. Scaling these solutions will be critical to combating the climate emergency while protecting high-value ecosystems and reversing nature loss. Building from WBCSD’s 2019 report Natural Climate Solutions: the Business Perspective which outlined the critical role that NCS can play in helping companies transition to net zero our 2020 report Mapping nature-based solutions and natural climate solutions clarifies the vital role of high-quality nature-based and natural climate solutions and their respective scopes towards achieving climate nature and broader development goals.

Nature-based action will be high on the international agenda this year. From negotiations at the UNFCCC COP26 in November to the UN Food Systems Summit in September and the UN General Assembly mobilizing countries to address the interconnected risks from climate change and nature loss will permeate international cooperation.

The CBD Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework will be key for championing and achieving stronger action from these agendas. After failing to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets leaders must agree to an ambitious Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to address biodiversity and nature loss which in turn will drive private sector action which is key to achieving it. Together with leaders from across science conservation and business WBCSD recently launched a Global Goal for Nature with three measurable objectives: zero net loss of nature from 2020; net positive by 2030 and; full recovery by 2050.

Business action to address the climate and nature crises is gaining momentum through net zero commitments and science-based targets but the ambitious yet necessary goals of climate and nature recovery require more. WBCSD has aligned its membership criteria and projects with the ambition of staying within 1.5 degrees of warming and contributing to full recovery of nature by 2050.

Pursuing “net-zero” impact – while critical – is ultimately insufficient by itself to achieving climate and nature recovery. WBCSD’s Natural Climate Solutions and Nature Action projects support business to scale nature’s role in achieving the Paris Agreement goals on climate change and to fully recover nature by 2050. Working with experts and members from across the world we help businesses to collaborate across sectors and value chains to scale natural climate solutions and nature-based solutions to our planetary emergency: to protect and restore the natural systems on which we all depend.

Restoring nature and our climate will require the concerted effort of us all but this effort will reward us with a healthy happy and prosperous planet that provides for 9 billion people. What action can you or your business take today to make these goals a reality?

Several smaller retrospective and prospective studies investigated RUX as pretreatment prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation with controversial results [1314151617181920]. In two studies [13 15] outcome after HSCT was particularly improved in patients with clinical improvement to RUX therapy while other reported side effects such as withdrawal symptom or an increased risk of infections [15 16 19] relative high incidence of graft failure [20] or in one prospective study tumor lysis syndrome cardiogenic shock and sepsis [19]. The results of this large retrospective EBMT study confirmed safety and feasibility of using RUX prior to HSCT and supports the expert recommendation regarding the use of JAK-inhibitor RUX in the context of stem cell transplantation [21]. The majority of the centers followed the EBMT/ELN recommendations regarding discontinuation of RUX and only in 6% of the patients a rebound phenomenon after discontinuation of RUX were reported. However none of these events were reported to be life threatening or required intensive treatment.

We observed a low risk of graft failure in patients who responded regarding spleen size to RUX prior to transplantation (6%) in comparison to RUX pretreated patients with no or lost spleen response prior to HSCT (15%) which highlights the role of spleen size regarding risk of graft failure in myelofibrosis patients [22]. This is further supported by 7% graft failure incidence of the non-RUX pretreated patients who had only a median spleen size of 8 cm at time of HSCT.

The presented large study which included 551 patients confirmed higher age and mismatched unrelated donors as significant factors for worse outcome as shown by several prospective and retrospective studies [2324252627282930]. In general the hazard ratio in RUX pretreated patients for NRM relapse EFS and OS was always <1.0 ranging from 0.68 to 0.81 but did not reach statistical significance for these outcome variables. However if the RUX pretreated patients were divided in patients with ongoing spleen response at time of transplantation and no or lost spleen response a clear benefit could be seen in a lower relapse rate which resulted in an improved EFS for patients who underwent HSCT with ongoing spleen response during RUX therapy. Furthermore even if not significant (p = 0.07) patients with ongoing spleen response had a lower NRM rate with only 15% and an HR of 0.56 in MVA further supporting the recommendation to transplant myelofibrosis patients with ongoing spleen response during RUX therapy rather than waiting until JAK inhibition treatment has failed. However reduced relapse rate lower NRM and improved EFS did not translate into a significantly improved OS at 2 years most likely because relapse can either be salvaged by donor lymphocyte infusion and/or second allograft and a larger follow-up is needed for valid conclusion regarding differences in OS [31 32]. An immunosuppressive effect of RUX has been described and affects mainly dendritic cells and T-cell populations [13 33]. The drug has been investigated in steroid refractory acute GVHD and has shown higher response rate at day 28 in a randomized comparison to best available therapy [34]. In a smaller pilot study given RUX during transplant period a low incidence of acute GVHD has been described [35]. In our study no effect of RUX on the incidence of acute GVHD could be seen most likely because of the short half-life of the drug which has been discontinued many days prior to graft infusion. The observed non-significant higher incidence of chronic GVHD in the RUX pretreated group might be best explained by the higher number of unrelated donor transplantation in the RUX arm.

Due to immunosuppressive effect some studies observed a higher incidence of CMV reactivation after HSCT in patients who received RUX prior to transplant and it is of interest that also in our study a higher but not significant incidence of CMV reactivation (36.6% vs. 26.8%) was observed in the RUX-pretreated CMV seropositive patients [15].

In our study we observed different lengths of time interval between diagnosis and transplantation in both arms with a considerable longer interval in the RUX pretreated arm which is in line with a recent real world report on RUX treatment showing prolonged treatment even in patients with unstable or no spleen response. This suggested a delaying transplant strategy rather than a bridging strategy [36]. However by using several statistical methods including left truncation or Poisson model we could not confirm that the variable time from diagnosis to transplant had any impact on event-free or OS in our study population. Although if other JAK inhibitors like fedratinib pacritinib or momelotinib have shown some activity in RUX pretreated patients [373839] the outcome after RUX-failure is poor. A large retrospective US population-based study showed for myelofibrosis patients after RUX discontinuation an OS of only 11.1 months [40]. Even if our study suggests better outcome in RUX responders than in those who discontinued RUX because of loss of response the 2-year survival is still about 60% after allografting in patients who failed to RUX. Whether these results can be improved by using a second-line JAK-inhibitor prior to transplant to reduce spleen size after RUX failure has to be shown in a prospective trial. Another concern of postponing transplant by continuing RUX therapy until treatment failure is the observed risk of clonal evolution during RUX treatment by acquiring new mutations [41]. The median duration of RUX in myelofibrosis in the literature is about 3 years but the drug is discontinued due to loss of response or side effects [7 8 42].

Our study has some limitations. Due to its retrospective nature the selection process that decided which patient received RUX prior to stem cell transplantation and which patient was scheduled for transplantation at spleen response or after RUX failure is unknown. It is likely that selection to RUX treatment was based on spleen size which was at a median 12 cm in the RUX pretreatment group and only 8 cm in the non-RUX group. Furthermore despite the trend for improved outcome for RUX pretreated patients other factors could drive the results instead of treatment exposure. However it should be noted that unfavorable factors such as DIPPS intermediate II/high risk and Karnofsky ≤ 80 were more seen in the RUX pretreated group.

In conclusion this large retrospective study showed feasibility of using RUX prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in myelofibrosis with no negative impact on NRM RI event-free and OS post-transplant. In particular a significant lower graft failure incidence rate was observed in RUX responders in comparison to RUX failure and a significantly lower relapse rate and improved EFS was seen for those who received stem cell transplant with ongoing spleen response to RUX in comparison to non-RUX treated patients.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS90YW1wYWJheS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIva3JvZ2VyLWhhcy1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWFycml2ZWQtaW4tdGFtcGEtYmF5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger offers grocery delivery in Tampa Bay - Tampa Bay Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2021/05/22/kroger-has-officially-arrived-in-tampa-bay.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS90YW1wYWJheS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIva3JvZ2VyLWhhcy1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWFycml2ZWQtaW4tdGFtcGEtYmF5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlcGh5a2VuLzIwMjEvMDUvMjMvaG93LWNhbi15b3UtY29tcGV0ZS13aXRoLWFtYXpvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Can You Compete With Amazon?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2021/05/23/how-can-you-compete-with-amazon/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlcGh5a2VuLzIwMjEvMDUvMjMvaG93LWNhbi15b3UtY29tcGV0ZS13aXRoLWFtYXpvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvNTAwbS1tZWdhLW1pbGxpb25zLWphY2twb3QtdGlja2V0LXNvbGQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc3ODQ3ODM10gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvVVMvNTAwbS1tZWdhLW1pbGxpb25zLWphY2twb3QtdGlja2V0LXNvbGQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc3ODQ3ODM1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No one's claimed $500M Mega Millions jackpot ticket sold in Pennsylvania,"It's the third-largest Mega Millions jackpot of all time.

No one's claimed $500M Mega Millions jackpot ticket sold in Pennsylvania

Someone in the Keystone State is half a billion dollars richer. A winning Mega Millions ticket from Friday night's drawing was sold in Pennsylvania with an estimated prize of $515 million according to a press release from Mega Millions.

But no one has yet come forward to claim the winnings a Pennsylvania lottery spokesperson told ABC News Saturday.

The ticket matched all six white ball numbers drawn on Friday -- 6 9 17 18 and 48 plus the gold Mega Ball 8.

Yesterday's win marks the third-largest Mega Millions jackpot of all time and the largest ever in Pennsylvania according to Mega Millions.

On Jan. 22 a group of players in Michigan won a $1.050 billion prize. The winning ticket was sold at a Kroger in Novi a northern suburb of Detroit -- about a 30-minute drive from the city -- the state lottery website confirmed. The winning numbers were 4-26-42-50-60 with a Mega Ball number of 24.

And on Feb. 16 a New York couple won $96 million.

There were other winners of small prizes as well in Friday's drawing. There was a total of 1702748 winners at all other prize levels according to the Mega Millions web site.

""Fifty-three tickets across the country matched four white balls plus the Mega Ball to win the game’s third prize. Ten of those are worth $30000 each because they included the optional Megaplier (a $1 additional purchase available in most states); the Megaplier for this drawing was 3X. The other 43 third-tier winning tickets are worth $10000 each"" Mega Million's press release stated.

Mega Millions is played in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The identification of Friday's winner has yet to be disclosed nor the location of where the winning ticket was sold.

Bronco II the special variant of the South African-made Ahrlac multi-role aircraft have been selected by the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to participate in the Armed Overwatch flight demonstration.

The Bronco II will compete against the Textron Aviation Defence AT-6E Wolverine L3 AT-802U Sky Warden MAG Aerospace MC-208 Guardian and Sierra Nevada Corporation M28/C-145 Wily Coyote.



The Bronco II is being pitched to the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for its low intensity combat warfare requirements (LICW) under the Armed Overwatch Programme (AOP).

SOCOM plans to procure 75 cheap aircraft for close air support (CAS) Precision airstrikes and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions to support US Special Forces in counter insurgency operations.

As a multi-mission aircraft the Mwari can undertake a wide range of roles which includes special forces missions that require the rapid finding fixing and finishing of targets as well as pipeline patrol and anti-poaching. The swappable modules allow it to have reconnaissance intelligence gathering close air support training cargo and light attack capabilities

According to SOCOM “The Armed Overwatch acquisition programme aims to provide Special Operations Forces with deployable affordable and sustainable manned aircraft systems capable of executing close-air support precision strike and armed intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance requirements in austere and permissive environments for use in operations against violent extremist organizations.”

To clinch the contract the Ahrlac/Bronco II will have to compete and win against the AC-208 (armed Cessna Caravan turboprop) M28/C-145 (a new armed version of the Skytruck twin-engine light transport) AT-802U (armed version of the cropduster) and AT-6E Wolverine trainer/light attack aircraft.

Although the Sierra Nevada/Embraer A-29 Super Tucano competed at the early stages the aircraft failed to make the cut and was removed from the contest.

SOCOM’s Armed Overwatch programme was halted in November last year but flight trials and demostrations have been resumed after a review.

SOCOM budgetted $101 million for the first batch with another $10 million per year for the next seven years. A May 14 announcement by SOCOM indicates that the command had also awarded a $19 million five fixed-price prototype project other transaction agreements (OTAs) to five companies for prototype demonstrations in mid-2021.

Each company will fly four demonstration flights between 14 June and 23 July at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.

If a prototype meets the requirements the company could be requested to provide a proposal for a follow-on production award later in 2022.

Drones are disallowed in the contest on the grounds that they require a larger footprint than manned aircraft.

Bronco II is a variant of the Advanced High-Performance Reconnaissance Light Aircraft (AHRLAC) it is a light reconnaissance and counter-insurgency aircraft made by AHRLAC Holdings a joint venture between the Paramount Group and Aerosud in South Africa.

Paramount Group started designing the AHRLAC in 2009 it was later rebranded in 2018 in order to market the aircraft to the US Air Force which was seeking to procure light attack aircraft at the time.

Leidos Paramount Group USA and Vertex Aerospace collaborated to pursue the Armed Overwatch contract with the Bronco II intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and light attack aircraft.

Leidos will act as the prime contractor while the US subsidiary of Paramount Group will serve as the sub-contractor and will provide the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) Vertex Aerospace (formerly a business unit of L3 Technologies) specializes in offering maintenance life support aerostructures fabrication and aircraft integration services will also serve as the sub-contractor.

Under Leidos the Bronco II will be manufactured in Crestview Florida and is designed to meet the specific needs of US Special Operations Command. Additional partners for the Bronco II platform include Leonardo DRS Dynetics Beast Code Fulcrum Concepts and Concord XXI aviation flight training.

In July 2018 the Mwari ISR and precision ground attack/strike aircraft secured its first customer. Paramount Group Executive Chairman Ivor Ichikowitz announced this during a press briefing at the Farnborough International Airshow on 18 July.

however Paramount Aerospace Holdings the subsidiary of Paramount Group reportedly shut down its operations in 2019 due to funding issues.

Although in July 2018 Paramount Group Executive Chairman Ivor Ichikowitz announced that the Mwari has secured a launch customer and has begun rolling off the production line however till date the launch customer is still unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We’ll be covering a new film on the list every Friday. Pull up a chair and let’s delve into some cinematic history!

Here’s the thing about Birth of a Nation: it’s on this list the list of 1001 movies you must see before you die. And I hate to part ways with the list on only its third entry but no — you don’t need to see Birth of a Nation before you die. What’s more you shouldn’t. I’m going to draw a line in the sand and say that there’s no legitimate reason to watch Birth of a Nation in this day and age. Any artistic merit it may have is just as vividly on display in any number of other films from the same period that don’t have an ugly visceral bone-deep racial hatred seen in DW Griffith’s famous historical epic that resounded so powerfully with certain white audiences that President Wilson declared it “history written with lightning” and it was credited with the twentieth-century resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan.

DW Griffith would spend years of his career after the release of Birth of a Nation trying to prove that he wasn’t racist. He would claim that his story was a war epic detailing the exploits of tragically intertwined families from the North and South during the Civil War. But if that’s the case why are all black men depicted as the lowest basest form of barbaric stereotypes? When a young white girl is cornered by a leering black man atop a cliff and she chooses to jump to her death rather than fall into his clutches the implications are clear: this is fragile white female purity under threat of defilement by black masculinity.

What purpose could this serve other than inflame whites’ racial hatred towards black men for the alleged crime of miscegenation? What motive could Griffith have had in showing a scene with a Congress full of black senators eating fried chicken bare feet resting disrespectfully on the hallowed desks of the Senate floor if not to stoke the racist fears of white audiences? It depicts black people as dangerous sexually deviant and worst of all sub-human. All of this contributes to propaganda that would define talking points in racial politics of decades.

But perhaps the most damning aspect of Birth of a Nation that speaks poorly of DW Griffith has nothing to do with the narrative: it’s something that happens behind the scenes. Birth of a Nation makes significant use of white actors in blackface which is problematic but not in and of itself unusual for the time period. But there are also black actors featured in several scenes. So why bother with blackface if you’re willing to cast black actors? If you look carefully you may notice that white actors in blackface are only used in certain scenes as specific characters: the ones who are required to interact on-screen with the white actresses. What does it say about a director that black men were so thoroughly distrusted that DW Griffith was not willing to risk having them at arm’s length of Lillian Gish or Mae Marsh? You could make the argument (although probably not successfully) that Griffith’s romanticization of the KKK is an attempt at a compelling dramatic narrative but there’s no way to excuse racist casting practices on set that reflect disturbing present-day attitudes.

So this I guess is where I and the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die list will have to agree to disagree. They believe that the artistic merit of Birth of a Nation and its ultimate historical impact outweighs its horrifying destructive racism and I believe that film history has been carrying water for DW Griffith for far too long. As frequently as he is credited with developing early narrative filmmaking other less-known films contributed equally and there’s little in Birth of a Nation especially that makes the experience worth it. So this one? Maybe you can skip it. Read the Wikipedia article about it and you will have absorbed everything you need to know about it.

But what to watch instead? I recommend Falling Leaves a film from 1912 (three years earlier than Birth of a Nation) by French director Alice Guy-Blache about a young girl whose older sister is diagnosed with a terminal case of tuberculosis. She overhears the doctor telling her mother (somewhat poetically) that her sister will die before the last leaf falls so she goes into the yard and desperately tries to tie fallen leaves back to the trees with string in a bid to keep her alive. It may not have a rousing Wagnerian chase sequence but it captures a deeply poignant sense of humanity that DW Griffith could only dream of.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5va2xhaG9tYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9vc2FnZS1wZW9wbGUtY29uZnJvbnQtdHJhdW1hdGljLWhpc3RvcnktYmVoaW5kLWtpbGxlcnMtZmxvd2VyLW1vb24tbW92aWUvNzM4NjE0MzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Complicated story behind 'Killers of the Flower Moon' needs to be told some Osage people say,"PAWHUSKA — Sitting on a bench across the street from the cowboy museum of Oscar-winning actor Ben Johnson Harrison Shackelford contemplated the cinematic history-in-the-making that will hit even closer to home for him.

Less than two blocks away Kihekah Avenue was showing signs on a recent spring afternoon of the major transformation it's been undergoing since filming began in April on Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon.""

""I think about it both ways. It was a bad time — a real bad time — for the Osage ... and I think this movie is going to bring back a lot of old bad memories. But it's going to bring back some stuff that needed to be talked about that needs to be said that some people know and some people don't know. And I think it's going to be good"" said Shackelford who is Osage.

Movies:Pawhuska gets a vintage makeover for 'Killers of the Flower Moon'

Although the production of Scorsese's star-studded reportedly $200 million movie has brought excitement to Osage County — the recreation of local landmarks from bygone days as facades and set pieces the glimpses of stars like Leonardo DiCaprio Robert De Niro and Native American actress Lily Gladstone in period garb the spreading of dirt on the part of Kihekah Avenue that has been transformed to resemble 1920s Fairfax — the real-life history behind the film is tragic and traumatic for the Osage people.

And that means many Osage Nation citizens have mixed feelings about the Apple Studios epic which is believed to be the biggest movie production ever launched in Oklahoma.

""It's definitely something that is delicate. ... It's a delicate balance that no matter what it's going to hurt some. And others are going to cheer it on"" said Brandy Lemon a member of the Osage Nation Congress working as a liaison on the film.

""If anybody knows anything about Martin Scorsese they're going to get everything in this film. They're going to get drama they're going to get violence in some form they're going to get anguish they're going to get happiness all the big feelings.""

'Should not be forgotten'

Calling it ""a time in American history that should not be forgotten"" Scorsese is adapting David Grann's 2017 best-seller “Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI."" His film will chronicle the slayings of Osage Nation citizens in 1920s Oklahoma after an oil boom made them the richest people per capita in the world.

""To be able to tell this story on the land where these events took place is incredibly important and critical to allowing us to portray an accurate depiction of the time and people"" Scorsese said in an April announcement that the pandemic-delayed project had started filming.

Between 1920 and 1925 there were more than 60 mysterious or unsolved murders in Osage County all connected with wealthy Osage citizens who had shares of valuable mineral lease royalties. The killings became known as the ""Reign of Terror"" and led to an investigation by the U.S. Bureau of Investigation (the precursor to the FBI).

""My biggest takeaway in the case of 'Killers of the Flower Moon' and the murders that it covers is the subhuman way that Native Americans were treated — not just that they were murdered but that it wasn't even hardly viewed as a crime that they were murdered"" said Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt who is Osage.

""The perpetrators were allowed by local and state authorities to basically get away with it. It required federal intervention for anyone to really be held accountable.""

'People got away scot-free'

Holt is among the Osage citizens who noted the similarities between the Reign of Terror and the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre which is having its centennial commemorated this year. Both happened in Oklahoma at roughly the same time but were hidden history until recently. Both were episodes of violence fueled by a poisonous blend of jealousy greed and racism.

And in both cases justice was often elusive.

""I feel like there's a parallel"" said Danette Daniels the Osage owner of Pawhuska's Water Bird Gallery. ""I'm such a promoter of the book by David Grann and of the movie. And it really is retribution in a sense by the world now knowing — because a lot these people got away scot-free with murders.""

Along with beaded jewelry Pendleton blankets and painted skulls Daniels sells signed copies of Grann's best-seller in her gallery.

""With the Ree Drummond empire here in Pawhuska I have people from all over the country and internationally come in and they know nothing about it. Nothing. That's why I'm such a giant proponent that this history be told"" said Daniels a Fairfax resident.

""If you don't know your history it can be repeated.""

'There's plenty of work to be done'

For a vast swath of prairie dotted with small towns rural hamlets and large ranches Osage County is experienced at dealing with Hollywood. A Food Network star Drummond has been lensing her show ""The Pioneer Woman"" on her family's Pawhuska ranch since 2011 spinning off a series of businesses that bring droves of tourists to town.

In 2012 the Academy Award-nominated movie version of Tulsa native Tracy Letts' Pulitzer Prize-winning play ""August: Osage County"" filmed in the titular location. And the museum memorializing Johnson — a native of the present-day ghost town of Foraker who won an Oscar for 1971's ""The Last Picture Show"" — opened in Pawhuska in 2019.

""That brings people here. ... and they're coming here for Ree Drummond. But now they're coming here for this (movie) too"" Shackelford said.

""They're doing a lot of stuff that's helping the town and they've provided a lot of jobs. ... There's plenty of work to be done.""

Construction projects are scattered across the county for Scorsese's big-budget epic with workers laboring to craft replicas of the local train station Catholic church and numerous businesses from the movie's era. The production trucked in a steam engine from Nevada to place on the train tracks its crews laid down and hauled in a fleet of 1920 cars after training people to drive them.

'A little bit of Hollywood in it'

Since the last picture show to depict the Reign of Terror was the 1959 Jimmy Stewart vehicle ""The FBI Story"" which played loose with the facts and crammed the Osage history between tales of gangsters and spies Billie Ponca said she is pleased to see a major movie putting such care into sharing her tribe's story.

""I think it needs to be told ... and I know for a fact that they have reached out to a lot of people. I just can't imagine it not being a success. I can't imagine it not being told in the right way. I'm sure there might be a little bit of Hollywood in it. ... But other than that I think it will be very factual"" said Ponca the former site manager of the White Hair Memorial near Hominy who now works at the Water Bird Gallery.

""And I don't know that you get any better than Martin Scorsese.""

In addition to respecting the Oscar winner's storytelling prowess several members of the Osage Nation said they appreciate his efforts to ensure the film authentically portrays their tribe.

Chief Geoffrey M. Standing Bear named Chad Renfro the tribe's ambassador to the production but the filmmakers are working with several cultural consultants local artisans and Osage Nation citizens.

Daniels said she was impressed when she met Scorsese at a 2019 dinner prepared by the Osage Gray Horse community.

""I was selected as one of the speakers to get up and to express concerns about the feature film and how we'd be depicted and just to tell him and his crew who we are as people"" she said. ""Three hundred of us from Gray Horse lined up in a big community building ... and he shook all of our hands.""

The director seemed touched by the food and gifts he received at the pre-COVID-19 gathering she said.

""He struck me and most of the people as a very sincere person who wants to get this right and do right by us. But I also know this is not a documentary and I also know he's an artist"" Daniels said. ""There's other Osages that are very skeptical ... but at least we've had input into the process.""

'You can't please all the people'

Apple Studios recently released through the Osage News a first-look image from ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" depicting Gladstone who is Blackfeet and Nez Perce as Mollie Burkhart an Osage woman whose family was targeted in the Reign of Terror sitting in a formal dining room beside DiCaprio who is portraying Mollie's treacherous husband Ernest Burkhart.

On social media some Osage people were thrilled to see the table set with traditional grape dumplings in beloved red Spode dishes. But others were concerned about the Pendleton blanket draped around Mollie's shoulders.

""I have made clothes for that character Mollie ... and I thought 'She had that blanket wrong' her wearing that fringe on the outside of it on her shoulders"" said Renae Brumley an Osage artisan who has worked with the production.

""But you can't please all the people all the time. ... My niece said 'You're all just lucky they didn't just take it and do what they wanted to do on a lot somewhere else and didn't ask your opinion.'""

'We're going to see some truth now'

The current site manager of the White Hair Memorial an Oklahoma Historical Society site that serves as a repository for Osage maps documents and textiles Brumley said the history of the 1920s murders gets complicated especially since so many of the killers and victims were linked by marital family or community ties.

Although they happened a century ago Grann said he stills considers the slayings ""living history.""

""This is one of the worst racial injustices and criminal conspiracies in American history. ... People were swindled out of hundreds of millions of dollars they lost loved ones they lost children"" Grann told The Oklahoman in a 2020 interview.

""I tracked down descendants of both the victims and the murderers. And many of them still live in the same neighborhoods side by side.""

In downtown Pawhuska Shackelford said he has become involved in the movie since he answered one of its casting calls although he couldn't discuss specifics.

Based on Lockheed Martin’s backlog of F-16 orders planned upgrades and the recent revelation that the Air Force plans to depend on the fighter into the late 2030s the F-16’s sunset years now could come in the 2070s or later.

Lockheed Martin’s backlog of 128 F-16s—all for foreign military sales—won’t all be delivered until 2026 and the company anticipates more orders may be coming. With a potential service life of 40 years or more those jets could be flying into the late 2060s or later. The type first entered service in the 1970s.

“There are 25 nations operating F-16s today” said Col. Brian Pearson Air Force Life Cycle Management Center lead for F-16 FMS in a May 17 press release. Lockheed’s Greenville S.C. F-16 manufacturing and upgrade facility which will start turning out new F-16s in 2022 “helps us meet the global demand” for F-16 aircraft he said. Lockheed moved its F-16 work from Fort Worth Texas in 2019 to make room there for expanded F-35 production.

Since the new line opened AFLCMC’s security assistance and cooperation directorate “has seen an uptick of our partner nations requesting detailed information and requests for U.S. government sales” said Col. Anthony Walker senior materiel leader in the international division.

The 128 jets are for Bahrain Bulgaria Slovakia Taiwan and another country the company declined to name although Croatia and the Philippines have been mentioned as customers. These aircraft will be in the Block 70/72 configuration which includes new radar displays conformal fuel tanks and other improvements over the Block 50/52 version the most recent flown by USAF. Lockheed is building F-16s at a rate of about four per month at Greenville.

India is also considering buying an advanced F-16 version Lockheed has dubbed the “F-21” which Lockheed touts as having a 12000-hour service life; roughly 50 percent more than the ones the USAF flies. At normal utilization 12000 hours is about 32 years of service. India would produce those jets indigenously. India is looking to buy 114 fighters and Lockheed is partnered with Tata to build the jets if it wins the competition.

Gregory M. Ulmer Lockheed’s vice president for aeronautics told reporters in February the company sees a potential for 300 additional F-16 sales not yet on the books some of which will be to “repeat” customers.

The increased foreign interest may be related to the USAF’s hints over the last two years that it will continue to fly the F-16 beyond previous plans thus reassuring customers that the parts and support pipeline for a large number of aircraft will persist.

Those hints turned more concrete in recent days. Talking points drawn up for USAF Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. about the service’s future fighter force plans obtained by Air Force Magazine indicate the Air Force expects that “600+ late-block F-16s will provide affordable capacity for the next 15+ years” in both competitive and permissive combat environments. These aircraft will in fact be the USAF’s “capacity force” the documents say and will serve as a “rheostat” meaning their total number can be adjusted up or down depending on the success of the F-35 program and a separate F-16 replacement now known as the Multi-Role-X.

The Air Force considers “competitive” to mean airspace that is reasonably well defended by aircraft and surface-to-air systems. “Highly competitive” and “denied” airspace would only be penetrable by fifth-gen and sixth-gen aircraft with extremely low observable qualities.

Although the fiscal year 2022 budget request to be released May 28 will reveal some details of the Air Force’s new force structure plans Brown said at the recent McAleese and Associates defense conference that the meat of the plan will be spelled out in the fiscal ’23 budget.

In the near-term the USAF plans the divestiture of all the F-16 “pre-blocks” of aircraft meaning all those that remain in its inventory of the Block 15-25-30 versions.

Lockheed received an indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract in January worth up to $64.3 billion for production of new F-16s for FMS customers as well as upgrades of 405 jets in foreign hands to the F-16V configuration which is similar to the F-21 model proposed to India. These modifications will include “new radar and other upgrades to make them similar to the aircraft that will come off the production line” AFLCMC’s release said.

The large omnibus contract creates a baseline F-16 configuration for all future production with the Air Force acting as the agent for FMS customers. Each country will sign a separate contract for unique or custom equipment they want on their particular jets. An Air Force official said the arrangement “simplifies and accelerates” the FMS process for countries wanting to buy the F-16 “so we can get it into their hands faster than has been the case in recent years.” The approach is needed because of the increased expected demand for the airplane he said. It also reduces the cost of the jet by allowing vendors to make larger more economic quantities of parts and structural components. The work will also integrate the Joint Mission Planning System/Mission Planning Environment software update.

The contract specifically mentioned work for Bahrain Bulgaria Chile Columbia Croatia Egypt Greece India Indonesia Jordan Morocco Korea Oman Pakistan the Philippines Poland Romania Singapore Slovenia Taiwan Thailand Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

Japan flies an F-16 variant called the F-2 but it performs all work on that type.

More than 4550 F-16s have been delivered to the U.S. and allied countries since the 1970s. The late Michele A. Evans Ulmer’s predecessor as Lockheed VP for aeronautics said in September 2020 the company sees a possibility “of getting up to 5000” F-16s built. She also said the company views the F-16 as an entrée to its F-35 for countries that are not yet ready to adopt the fifth-generation fighter but may wish to later.

Brig. Gen. Dale R. White the USAF’s program executive officer for fighters and advanced aircraft called the F-16 an “enduring highly capable compact fighter that will have a large role in many partner nations’ security for years to come.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1L3Vzc29jb20tY29tbWVudHMtb24tcG90ZW50aWFsLWFtcGhpYmlvdXMtbWMtMTMwai1wbGFuZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USSOCOM Comments on Potential Amphibious MC-130J Plane,"USSOCOM Comments on Potential Amphibious MC-130J Plane At Virtual SOFIC 2021 United States Special Operations Command’s (USSOCOM) Colonel Ken Kuebler Program Executive Officer for Fixed Wing presented the concept of an amphibious MC-130J “Commando II” special forces transport turboprop aircraft (called “MAC”) that can take off and land on both the ground and in the water increasing mission flexibility and versatility.

Naval News asked USSOCOM how “Realistic” the MC-130J Amphibious Capability or MAC concept is.

The MC-130J “Commando II” is the latest version of the venerable Lockheed Martin C-130 “Hercules” transport plane. The J-variant has improved performance over its C-130E/H predecessors such as 40% greater range 21% higher maximum speed and 41% shorter takeoff distance and the J-variant can come in standard C-130 length or stretched out by adding 15 more feet (4.6 meters) to the fuselage and calling it the C-130J-30. The C-130J can best be differentiated from the C-130E/H predecessors by the curved propeller blades distinct and unique to the J-variant for better turboprop performance.

The USSOCOM special forces MC-130J is further modified from the standard C-130J variant with “special forces’ mission-specific government furnished equipment” and other unique and custom modifications.

“The C-130J-SOF variant builds on our proven C-130J platform and features an EO/IR [Electro-Optical/Infrared] Imaging System for ISR [Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance] upgraded 60/90 KVA Generators and 400 AMP regulated transformer rectifier units (RTRU) that doubles the electrical capacity of the aircraft. The extra power supports future mission requirements by providing growth provisions for tanker/receiver refueling and armed ISR. Changes to the baseline C-130J include the addition of an armor protection system and lower fuselage protection for damage tolerance; added crew position stations for a combat system operator (CSO) and scanner automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) out; and external fuel tanks for increased range/loiter time.

Lockheed Martin’s MC-130J in flight. USSOCOM is exploring the possibility of making this amphibious although as of May 2021 details remain very preliminary on how best to achieve this. Lockheed Martin photo.

“The MC-130J Commando II multi-mission combat transport/special operations tanker assigned to the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) delivers increased combat performance to the warfighter with its more powerful engines and unique features. As it replaces the older MC-130N/P Combat Shadow II aircraft the MC-130J provides AFSOC with a modern aircraft capable of worldwide employment for missions requiring clandestine single- or multi-ship low-level aerial refueling of Special Operation Force vertical and tilt-rotor aircraft and/or infiltration resupply and exfiltration by airdrop or landing on remote airfields.”

The USSOCOM PEO Fixed Wing slide at virtual SOFIC 2021 that caused a Defense media buzz. The MAC illustration shows a MC-130J on floats skimming just above the water Slide: PEO FW SOFIC 2021

U.S. Navy Commander Tim Hawkins USSOCOM spokesperson responded to Naval News on the status of this concept within SOCOM via email:

“MC-130J Amphibious Capability or “MAC” as we call it is a concept we are exploring. The MAC concept involves being able to modify the aircraft and give it the capability to take off and land both on the ground and water – all in the same mission. This is a challenging physics and engineering proposition so SOCOM is currently working with industry on feasibility and operational studies as well as digital designs in order to determine the best path forward on capability development”

USSOCOM didn’t provide further details such as if other branch services such as the U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard are interested in joint-development and joint-funding of this project. Since the MC-130J “Commando II” is a specific USSOCOM fixed wing asset with mission systems only used by the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) USSOCOM appears to be “going it alone” at this time with the amphibious MAC concept. SOCOM also didn’t provide an estimated date as to initial MAC prototype rollout testing and eventual AFSOC fielding.

Naval News Comments

According to the United States Geological Survey approximately 71-percent of the Earth is covered by water so having an amphibious MC-130J would be a great benefit and advantage to improve USSOCOM mobility (and that of the other U.S. and NATO users of the C-130J).

A few nations already use in-service seaplanes such as Russia China and Japan. Most of them seem to incorporate the use of a seaplane hull instead of buoyant floats.

If the MAC is built the emphasis on MAC’s amphibious mobility cannot be understated for USSOCOM and the special forces especially regarding any potential overseas crisis and conflicts in the littorals around islands in gulfs in the Arctic waters and in the vast ocean where land can be few and far away. SOCOM MC-130Js have been used to drop rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) and commandos from the air and with the MAC RHIBs divers small boats and hovercraft minisubs unmanned sea and subsurface drones underwater sensors and jetskis might be able to be deployed and retrieved via the stern ramp of floating amphibious AFSOC MC-130Js. MACs can also act as floating refueling bases able appear anywhere in the oceans to refuel thirsty sea vessels.

If used by conventional forces convoy escorts with a long-endurance U.S. seaplane might become a reality again as would more versatile patrols; more flexible Anti-Submarine and Anti-Surface Warfare patrols; more mobile logistics; expanded fleet repair; a land and sea mothership for unmanned air surface and sub-surface drones a ISR pursuit aircraft in the Drug War a Visual Board Search and Seizure floating base an airborne Amphibious Expeditionary Forward Staging Base and refueler and a Search and Rescue seaplane to name several new MAC role examples.

Details on the amphibious MC-130J presented at Virtual SOFIC 2021 are in the nascent stages. USSOCOM didn’t state on if there are plans for an amphibious armed AC-130J or on how many MACs SOCOM intends to build and acquire.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1uZXdzMS5jb20vY2EvbGEtd2VzdC90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvcGFsbWRhbGUtYWVyb3NwYWNlLWFjYWRlbXktcHJlcGFyZXMtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLW9mLWlubm92YXRvcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palmdale Aerospace Academy prepares innovators,"PALMDALE Calif. — At first glance Palmdale Aerospace Academy students Ricky Montano and Amara Osegueda are standing around what looks like a contraption made of cardboard PVC pipe and straps but to these 11th graders it represents so much more.

What You Need To Know Palmdale Aerospace Academy is a public charter school focusing on STEM education



Brian Martin a STEM teacher at the school teaches an engineering design and development class that challenges students to come up with a solution to a real-world problem create a prototype and present it to a panel of engineers



Martin said his class and others at the academy prepare and inspire students to pursue STEM careers especially aerospace in the Antelope Valley which is often considered a leader in aerospace with companies including Lockheed Martin and NASA



Martin said there is a push to inspire young people to pursue engineering careers because many of the current workforce is 60 and over

""This is more of a chest strap but it was supposed to represent like the waist strap that we wanted to keep the patient secure"" Montano said as he points to different parts of the prototype which is a walker designed for people who have cerebral palsy.

Montano said he was inspired after seeing two cousins grow up with the condition which affects a person's ability to move.

""We normally take our walking ability for granted people like her they can't do much and then my other cousin can kind of walk but she's not exactly the best at walking so she always has to be supervised and it just kind of sucks"" he said.

Montano Osegueda and classmate Angie Barahona spent nine months meeting virtually taking the idea from conception to reality. It is part of an engineering design and development class taught by STEM teacher Brian Martin who has 24 years of teaching experience.

""They look at what kind of solution or innovation they would have you know make it better stronger faster more efficient right?"" said the science technology engineering and math teacher. ""And then they look at similar solutions and then they look at patents and then they set their mind on it and then they go!""

Osegueda said their prototype involved a lot of trial and error.

""We just made it happen and even though it's like not in a great prototype it's giving an idea of what it is supposed to be like"" she said.

Martin said eight student teams came up with innovative ideas that included an alarm for unattended strollers and eco-friendly shoelaces. It prepares them for STEM careers; a talent much needed in the Antelope Valley.

""Our school has a partnership between the City of Palmdale and all of our local aerospace industry Northrup Lockheed NASA Edwards Air Force Base"" he said. ""They knew that 60% of the engineers were 50 and over. You know there is a crisis in our country. There is two million high-knowledge high-paying jobs that are unfilled by people in our own country and it's really a crisis.""

Martin said 80% of students are college-bound and many may even have jobs by the time they graduate high school. However right now they are focused on presenting their prototypes to industry professionals for feedback in an annual showcase.

The exercise gives them a taste of the working world that awaits them. Osegueda plans to take the skills she has learned and work in healthcare or business. Montano is torn between aerospace and forensic science.

""I like the math and I like the science so I feel like it was a pretty good combination plus I'm really not squeamish so I was like why not?"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvaG93LXNob290LWRvd24tc3RlYWx0aC1mLTIyLXJhcHRvci1hc2stZnJhbmNlLXRoZXktZGlkLTE4NTg5N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Shoot Down a Stealth F-22 Raptor? Ask France They Did.,"The Lockheed Martin-made F-22 is supposed to be the most fearsome warplane in history a quarter-billion-dollar-per-plane technological marvel that flies higher and faster than its opponents while avoiding detection by radar. But it's not unstoppable.

Here's What You Need To Remember: Even before the Emirati and French wins in 2009 the Americans knew the F-22 could be beaten although they rarely mentioned this uncomfortable fact.

Past evidence seems to confirm that a French fighter pilot once “killed” an American F-22 Raptor stealth fighter in mock combat.

Although not unprecedented the simulated shoot-down is still a big deal for a couple reasons.

For one the Lockheed Martin-made F-22 is supposed to be the most fearsome warplane in history a quarter-billion-dollar-per-plane technological marvel that flies higher and faster than its opponents while avoiding detection by radar. The Pentagon is counting on a tiny number of the pricey Raptors — slightly more than 180 — to ward off potentially much larger numbers of enemy planes for the foreseeable future. Every mock dogfight the F-22 loses undermines the Pentagon’s plans for air dominance.

Plus the French still have a totally undeserved reputation in non-French military circles for battlefield incompetence — one based mostly on a bad reading of World War II history. That a French pilot could defeat an F-22 speaks volumes about the Raptor’s limitations … and about French air-combat prowess seven decades after Paris’ surrender to Nazi Germany.

The French victory over the F-22 occurred in November 2009. A squad of F-22s from the Air Force’s 1st Fighter Wing in Virginia flew to Al Dhafra in the UAE to train with French air force Rafale fighters and Typhoon jets from the British Royal Air Force.

The following month the French Ministry of Defense released video captures from a Rafale’s forward-facing camera showing an F-22 in a disadvantageous dogfighting position implying the French plane had won at least one round of pretend fighting.

But the American pilots insisted their planes had gone undefeated against the French during the November exercise — that in fact the F-22s had “shot down” Rafales in six one-on-one engagements. Five other simulated battles ended in draws the Americans said. The U.S. pilots copped to just one loss in the war game — an F-22 defeated by a Mirage 2000 flown by an Emirati aviator.

But a video posted by a French Website on June 18 proves that the Americans were lying — or at least incorrect. The video from the Rafale’s camera clearly shows the French plane maneuvering into a good position to launch an infrared-guided Mica missile against a defending F-22.

To be fair it’s unclear what scenario the jets were playing out: whether for instance the F-22 started out slower and lower in order to let the Rafale gain the advantage for training purposes. Nevertheless the video shows that the Rafale a decade older and less sophisticated compared to the F-22 can be roughly comparable to the Raptor when maneuvering at low speed during close combat.

Even before the Emirati and French wins in 2009 the Americans knew the F-22 could be beaten although they rarely mentioned this uncomfortable fact. During the Raptor’s first-ever major air exercise in 2006 an Air Force F-16 most likely dating from the 1980s managed to “kill” an F-22. A Navy Growler jetdesigned to jam enemy radars repeated the feat in 2008 or early 2009.

“No matter how magical the F-22 any pilot can make a mistake” admitted Lt. Col. Dirk Smith a Raptor squadron commander.

And the 2009 war game would not be the last to result in “dead” Raptors. In June 2012 a contingent of German pilots (flying the same new Typhoon fighters as the British) figured out the best tactics for shooting down the F-22.

Eight times during a two-week war game in Alaska individual German Typhoons flew against single F-22s in basic fighter maneuvers meant to simulate close-range dogfights. “We were evenly matched” German Maj. Marc Gruene told Combat Aircraft.

The key Gruene said was to get as close as possible to the powerful F-22 … and stay there. “They didn’t expect us to turn so aggressively.”

Gruene said the Raptor excels at fighting from beyond visual range with its high speed and altitude high-tech radar and long-range missiles. But in a slower close tangle — what pilots call a “merge” — the heavier F-22 is at a disadvantage. “As soon as you get to the merge … the Typhoon doesn’t necessarily have to fear the F-22” Gruene said.

Neither does the 30-year-old American F-16 a Navy jamming plane or the 1990s-vintage Rafale — flown by a Frenchman! The worrying implication of course is that Chinese Russian and other rival planes also need not worry about America’s main jet fighter.

Here in the United States we desperately need news coverage of Palestine that is centered from a marginalized perspective. As Israeli human rights group B’Tselem director Hagai El-Ad explains the Israeli media is pushing a story of “Israel under attack” rather than seeking to contextualize the current situation in Gaza.

And yet the IDF dropped bombs last week on apartment towers in Palestine killing dozens of civilians including children. The bombs were designed and manufactured by our own Lockheed Martin the number one U.S. federal government contractor. This comes at a time where our own president Biden has just proposed a $700+ billion defense budget more than half of the total federal budget. We are reaping what we sow.

While Israeli media blames Hamas for sending rockets Palestinian news coverage on the ground this week has described massive and united youth uprisings agaist settler colonialism the likes of which haven’t been seen since 1936. The free people the United States must stand in solidarity with the Palestinian youth and demand an end to our complicity in Israeli war crimes.

All the big cats are gone now from the private zoo that never opened to the public and now likely never will.

Federal authorities last week completed the removal of the remaining 68 big cats from the property a few miles north of the Oklahoma-Texas border.

They also removed a jaguar.

The rocky start to the zoo was chronicled in the final episode of the Netflix true-crime documentary series ""Tiger King: Murder Mayhem and Madness.""

Zookeeper Jeff Lowe and his wife Lauren came to fame last year when the Netflix series became a cultural phenomenon at the start of the pandemic. They moved the big cats to the location in Thackerville after shutting down the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in August.

The U.S. Justice Department filed a federal civil complaint against the Lowes last November over their care of the animals. A U.S. district judge in January ordered the removal of 10 tiger cubs and their mothers.

The latest removal came when federal agents raided the park May 6 and again last Monday and Tuesday. The Justice Department announced the seizure Thursday.

“This seizure should send a clear message that the Justice Department takes alleged harm to captive-bred animals protected under the Endangered Species Act very seriously” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jean E. Williams of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.

Attorney:'Tiger King' star Jeff Lowe ready to give up big cats to end lawsuit

Jeff and Lauren Lowe already had been talking about giving up the animals anyway. They deny mistreating them.

""The Lowes want out completely"" their attorney Daniel Card told U.S. District Judge John F. Heil III at a contempt hearing May 12.

""They don't want to fight this anymore. They don't want to do it"" he said. ""They want to give the tigers to a ... sanctuary of their choice and be done with it.""

A U.S. magistrate judge in Muskogee authorized the raids after being told there was evidence the Lowes were secretly breeding the big cats in violation of a court order.

Magistrate Judge Steven P. Shreder was told big cat cubs had been seen at the property in April and are considered a profit source ""because members of the public will pay to directly interact with them.""

""Any cubs born at Tiger King Park are in grave danger because based on evidence of past practices the cubs are likely to be removed from their mothers too early and the Lowes consistently fail to provide them with adequate nutrition"" U.S. Agriculture Department specialist Laurie Gage wrote in an affidavit.

The judge was told two of the big cats removed May 6 appear to be pregnant and another that could not be removed on the first day may be.

Most of the big cats removed from the park during the raids were tigers.

A special agent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported Lauren Lowe threatened to kill him during the May 6 raid.

""The statement was especially intimidating because their former Tiger King business partner is serving a prison sentence for hiring a hit man to assassinate a business rival in another state"" Agent Kevin Seiler reported.

""When I provided Jeff Lowe with a copy of the property receipt he aggressively snatched it from my hand and crumpled it up in his fist while engaging the entire time in the creation of a disturbance yelling and screaming profanities in an apparent self-scripted effort to film the exchange for what he had commented earlier would be sold to Netflix as 'Tiger King 2'"" the agent reported.

He is serving a 22-year sentence in federal prison for trying to have his chief critic Carole Baskin killed and for other crimes. He claims he is innocent and that Jeff Lowe set him up.

Joe Exotic recently called on President Joe Biden to pardon him so he can go home and get ""proper medical care"" for prostate cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vdGlnZXIta2luZy1qZWZmLWxvd2UtdGlnZXJzLXNlaXplZC1mYmkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tiger King's Jeff Lowe Has 70 Big Cats Seized by the Feds,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vdGlnZXIta2luZy1qZWZmLWxvd2UtdGlnZXJzLXNlaXplZC1mYmkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3N2bi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9sYXN0LWNhdC1vdXQtb2YtdGhlLXRpZ2VyLWtpbmctcGFyay1iYWctYXMtc2VpenVyZS1jb21wbGV0ZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Last cat out of the Tiger King Park bag as seizure completed,"THACKERVILLE Okla. (AP) — Federal officials have removed the last of the 68 big cats from the private zoo in Oklahoma that had been the center of the “Tiger King” saga.

A jaguar was among the last cat removed from Tiger King Park in Thackerville a few miles north of Oklahoma’s border with Texas The Oklahoman reported Sunday.

The turbulent beginnings of the zoo were the subject of the final episode of the Netflix true-crime series “Tiger King: Murder Mayhem and Madness.” Zookeeper Jeff Lowe moved the cats to a Thackerville property after the August shutdown of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park.

The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday announced the seizure of the federally protected lions tigers lion-tiger hybrids and a jaguar as part of a court-approved agreement to resolve a federal complaint against Lowe and his wife Lauren Lowe over the animals’ care.

The civil complaint filed in November accused the Lowes of recurring inhumane treatment and improper handling of animals protected by the Endangered Species Act. The couple received numerous citations for failing to properly care for the animals following three inspections of the Tiger King Park in Thackerville since December 2020.

During a hearing two weeks ago a judge found the couple in contempt for failing to comply with court orders to employ a qualified veterinarian and establish a program of veterinary care for the animals. Daniel Card an attorney for the couple told a federal judge that the Lowes “want out completely.”

Jeff Lowe was a central figure in “Tiger King” that featured a mullet-wearing zookeeper named Joe Exotic and became a cultural phenomenon last year. Joe Exotic a pseudonym for Joseph Maldonado-Passage is serving a 22-year sentence in federal prison in Texas for his 2020 conviction on charges that he participated in a murder-for-hire plot and violated federal wildlife laws.

The Actor Finally Reveals the Truth,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle don't exactly have low-profile neighbors. The royal couple's Montecito home is in the same locality as plenty of famous celebrities like their recent interviewer Oprah Winfrey and star couples like Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry.

Now one of their other neighbors Rob Lowe discussed how things changed when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved into his neighborhood. Lowe told the E! Daily Pop podcast “They definitely have brought a lot of attention to my sleepy little town. Let me tell you something once the royals move into your neighborhood the neighborhood is never going to be the same.”

Press coverage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has only increased ever since their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. And while that revealing interview raised many questions one thing on many people's minds was: Where was it filmed?

Lowe also covered this topic in the interview after rumors circulated suggesting that it was filmed at his house. Lowe laughed and said “It's so funny. Everybody thinks the interview is shot at my house and then my friend Ted Sarandos who runs Netflix everybody thought they shot it at his house.”

However Lowe doesn't think that it was shot at some secret location. He said “Here's my thing and I have no idea: I think they just plain old shot it at Oprah's. I swear to you and they just said it was a mystery location.”

Lowe who has lived in his home for 26 years said new neighbors like the royals and Oprah have helped breathe new life into Montecito. Still there are a few small downsides. “Now that the royals are here: The good news is property values go up the bad news is the line is longer at Starbucks” Lowe joked.

It seems we'll just have to keep guessing where the royal couple filmed their internet-breaking interview (for now at least).

Rob Lowe has addressed rumours that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s sit-down with Oprah Winfrey was held at his house.

In March this year the Duke and Duchess of Sussex sat down for a highly publicised interview with Winfrey during which a number of shocking revelations were made.

The backdrop of the interview looked to be a manicured garden with many people seemingly recognising the outdoor setting as Lowe’s personal home in California.

The Parks and Recreation star recently addressed the speculation during an interview on E! News’s Daily Podcast.

“It’s so funny. Everybody thinks the interview is hot at my house and then my friend Ted Sarandos who runs Netflix everybody thought they shot it at his house” said the actor.

The 57-year-old clarified that he had not lent out his property for filming and suggested an alternative theory instead.

He said: “Here’s my thing and I have no idea. I think they just plain old shot it at Oprah’s. I swear to you they just said it was a mystery location.”

Prince Harry made headlines yesterday (21 May) following the release of his mental health docuseries The Me You Can’t See on which he also worked with Winfrey.

The alleged windfall donation to FAMU came from Batterson Farms Corporation’s Gregory Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust and would’ve almost tripled the school’s endowment helping students and faculty for generations. But after the announcement was made — with major fanfare during a Saturday commencement ceremony — skepticism quickly quelled the celebration.

For one Batterson Farms Corporation appears to be a relatively small outfit based in Texas selling hydroponic hemp farm products leading some to question how its stocks could be worth millions. The doubts have been heightened by reports about Gerami’s past dealings including a $95 million donation to Coastal Carolina University in 2020 that was terminated by school officials only weeks after it was publicly announced.

FAMU foundation members raised these points during Thursday’s emergency meeting while venting frustrations about how school staff transacted a nine-figure donation without telling them or the board of trustees. Some board members claimed to have learned about the donation from the university’s press release or from friends after graduation. The board of trustees had already called a special meeting for next week to discuss the donation before Thursday’s shock announcement.

“How did we get this far without knowledge of the transaction or the donor?” asked Chekesha Kidd a foundation member who is co-founder and CEO of Kinumi a concierge service.

School leaders — including Robinson and Shawnta Friday-Stroud FAMU’s vice president for university advancement — said they were barred from discussing the gift publicly due to a non-disclosure agreement. They defended accepting the donation from Batterson Farms Corporation noting the potential upside should the company go public. Batterson Farms did not respond to a request for comment about the potential future value of its stock.

Still the shares could be worth “$500 million or it could be zero” Laurence A. Humphries a member of the foundation’s board noted at the meeting.

“Yes there is clearly risk and we are seeing that in everything that has shaken out” Friday-Stroud said during the meeting. “But at the time that was the decision.”

FAMU did not reach out to Coastal Carolina University as they vetted Gerami’s gift officials confirmed Thursday.

That failed donation was one of several red flags that should have been raised during the vetting of FAMU’s gift according to finance experts.

The gift would have been paid out over the next decade according to an agreement obtained through a records request Thursday by the Tallahassee Democrat. The agreement shows that Gerami “donated 14 million shares of stock of intrinsic value worth at least $239000000 and will donate an additional $61000000 over 10 years” — valuations that don’t match what the school announced only days ago.

The agreement though does not specifically name a company and it’s unclear where and how the stocks were valued.

“Where does this valuation come from?” Rebel Cole a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University said in an interview. “It raises more questions than it answers. If I were a dog my hackles would be up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBkAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire bully Katherine Asplundh's new in-laws have $95M history of exploiting undocumented workers: ruling,"Pennsylvania’s billionaire Asplundh family were dragged into a bullying scandal after their son’s new wife tried to force another woman to give up her Instagram handle and now it has emerged they were once fined $95 million for hiring undocumented workers.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and recieved the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment. The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote. “I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife. “Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

After the other woman posted the screenshots the newlywed deleted her Instagram account.

The new bride’s in-laws own the Asplundh Tree Expert Co. in Pennsylvania which is the 109th largest private company in America with a revenue of $5.42 billion in 2023 according to Forbes.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9lc3BuL2JldHRpbmcvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC80MDEwMjE2Ni9taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1wYXJsYXktdGlja2V0LWJldHRvci1va2xhaG9tYS1jaXR5LXRodW5kZXItdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticket of dreams? One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question.

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

The money would plug hundreds of abandoned wells and restore the often-polluted land surrounding them and in the process would employ oilfield workers who had been furloughed after prices crashed.

The program largely accomplished those goals. But some environmental advocates say it achieved another they didn’t expect: It bailed out dozens of small to mid-sized oil companies relieving them of their responsibility to pay for cleaning up their own wells by using taxpayer money instead.

Oil drillers are generally required to plug their wells after they’re done producing crude. But in practice companies are often able to defer that responsibility for years or decades. Larger companies often sell older wells to smaller ones which sometimes go bankrupt leaving the wells with no owner.

These “orphaned wells” become the responsibility of the federal or state governments depending on where they were drilled. While oil companies are required to post bonds or other financial assurance to pay for plugging them in reality those bonds cover only a tiny fraction of the costs leaving taxpayers on the hook. One estimate by the Carbon Tracker Initiative a financial think tank found that those bonds cover only a tiny fraction of the expected costs of cleaning up the nation’s oil and gas wells.

But in North Dakota it turned out that most of the wells the state plugged were not truly orphaned but had solvent owners. After the industry warned last year that the pandemic-driven oil-crash was threatening its finances state regulators stepped in assumed ownership of more than 300 wells and used CARES Act funds to plug them meaning the companies avoided paying anything themselves.

“What happened was a bunch of people got a free ride” said Scott Skokos executive director of the Dakota Resource Council a grassroots environmental group in the state.

Skokos said it only deepened his sense that the state had bailed out the industry. In October regulators were granted permission from state lawmakers to send about $16 million of the CARES Act funds as grants to oil companies to help them buy water to hydraulically fracture new wells a step the regulators said was necessary to expend the funds by the end of the year. Nine companies took advantage of the program. In one case a single company Continental Resources received $5.4 million according to state records.

Wyoming also sent about $30 million in Covid relief funds to oil companies as grants to either frack new wells or revive or plug old ones.

Some advocates say that such well-plugging programs highlight a larger problem: Millions of aging unplugged oil and gas wells dot the ground from Appalachia to California often carrying oil and toxins to the surface contaminating groundwater and leaking climate-warming methane gas into the atmosphere.

The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the nation’s unplugged wells leaked about 263000 tons of methane in 2019 which when compared to carbon dioxide over a 20-year period is equivalent to the climate-warming emissions of more than 5 coal-fired power plants. The agency added that the actual figure could be significantly smaller or three times greater.

While many of the wells—hundreds of thousands at least—are orphaned many more are still operated by oil companies that critics say have avoided plugging them because of regulations that allow the industry to postpone cleaning them indefinitely eventually dumping the responsibility on taxpayers.

President Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan calls for spending $16 billion to clean up the nation’s orphaned wells and coal and hardrock mines and lawmakers have drafted bills with similar goals.

Environmentalists leaders in both political parties and the oil industry all support directing federal dollars to plug orphaned wells as a way to address climate change and pollution while creating jobs for oilfield workers. But some advocates say that what happened in North Dakota shows the risks of spending billions of dollars without sufficient scrutiny and without requiring oil companies to put up more money to pay for plugging their wells.

“There’s an incredible opportunity to begin cleaning up and better cataloging orphan wells while creating well-paying jobs” said Sara Cawley a legislative representative for Earthjustice an environmental nonprofit. But she said any federal spending needs to be tied with regulatory reforms including requiring companies to set aside more money for plugging “so that taxpayers are not continuing to pay for clean-up in perpetuity.”

Two bills have been introduced so far. Both would direct billions of dollars to plug orphaned wells on state federal and tribal lands and both include language that would encourage states to improve well-plugging regulations by tying a portion of the funding to reforms. Only one however by Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) would require oil companies to purchase more expensive bonds when drilling on federal land leaving more money available in case of default.

Lynn Helms director of North Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources defended the state’s program from criticism that it bailed out the industry saying it targeted companies that were facing financial stress because of last year’s crash in oil prices and that in some cases small mom-and-pop operations did not have the funds to plug the wells. He said his department has begun to pursue reimbursement from some of the companies that are still solvent and has already obtained more than $3 million to reimburse a state well-plugging fund that covered some costs beyond the $66 million from the CARES Act.

He said the program served the intent of the CARES Act—to stimulate the economy and support employment—by creating more than 3700 jobs “and that was the number one purpose for why we did this.”

Helms said the $16 million in grants for fracking was also intended to support workers and state finances which are highly dependent on tax revenues from oil production. The grants he said supported about 600 jobs and boosted production in December shoring up funding for schools and other programs. While he acknowledged that Continental and other companies were essentially given a multi-million dollar discount “that wasn’t the purpose” he said.

Some environmental advocates have countered that whatever the intent North Dakota effectively gave the oil industry a backdoor subsidy and sent an implicit signal that taxpayers will come to its rescue when times are tough.

“In North Dakota I think the story is in some ways a fairly succinct one” said Nikki Reisch director of the climate and energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law which highlighted the state’s program in a recent report. “Taxpayer dollars were being used to pick up polluters’ tabs while at the same the state was repurposing federal funds to support new fracking making the very same problem worse.”

’Pollution Vectors’

No one knows how many old wells are scattered across the nation’s oil and gas fields. According to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission states have identified nearly 57000 orphaned wells but estimate there are hundreds of thousands more undocumented ones. The EPA has estimated there are more than 3 million abandoned wells regardless of whether they have owners or not. Often companies can avoid plugging wells when they are no longer productive by calling them idled a status that can last decades.

Locally old wells can contaminate groundwater and foul farmland spewing not only petroleum but also toxic highly salty water. Abandoned well sites render sections of farmers’ fields unusable.

Companies are generally required to purchase bonds when they drill wells as a form of insurance—governments can confiscate the bonds if companies fail to plug their own wells. Lawmakers or regulators determine the levels for those bonds—for example $10000 per well or $150000 for all a company’s wells within a state—but in many cases those levels were set decades ago and barely begin to cover plugging costs.

Carbon Tracker has collected data on more than 2.4 million catalogued unplugged wells including all the nation’s active wells and has estimated it would cost about $288 billion to plug them. But its analysis showed that state and federal bonds would cover only about 1 percent of that cost raising the question of who will pay the difference if companies go bankrupt or fail to plug their wells. That estimate for the coverage of bonds excluded Texas for which Carbon Tracker was unable to obtain data. Last week New Mexico’s State Land Office released a report that found that oil company bonds in the state covered 2 percent of the expected cleanup costs falling $8.1 billion short.

Rob Schuwerk executive director of Carbon Tracker’s North American office said the looming transition away from oil and gas will make the problem worse. It is one thing if industry revenues are stable or growing and companies only occasionally bail on their cleanup responsibilities. But if oil and gas demand begins to decline the industry is likely to face falling revenues and a spike in bankruptcies just as companies abandon a wave of unprofitable wells. They might not have money to plug their own wells leaving taxpayers on the hook.

Last year served as a preview when global lockdowns sent oil demand plummeting. In North Dakota that meant oil companies had to shut their wells and layoff workers as their revenues dwindled.

The conditions prompted warnings of bankruptcies and led regulators to ask the state to spend CARES Act relief funds on plugging and remediating abandoned wells which they warned could become orphaned if not addressed.

In order to plug the wells the state had to assume ownership of them a step that was welcomed by Ron Ness who runs the North Dakota Petroleum Council which represents the industry. But at a state hearing last year Ness warned regulators against also seizing the bonds companies had bought as insurance for plugging the wells. Although the bonds might help pay plugging costs seizing them would have “very real” impacts that would prove to be “extremely problematic” Ness said.

Ness argued that the CARES Act was effectively reimbursing the state for the cost of plugging the wells. If regulators did seize the bonds he argued the state could have to return funds to the federal government.

The petroleum council did not respond to phone messages or emails. But Schuwerk said that confiscating a bond could pose problems for the company that purchased it. Bond companies could suddenly view that company as a risk and require it to pay higher premiums for its other bonds for example driving up drilling costs.

Regulators have largely granted Ness’s request at least so far. According to data provided by the Department of Mineral Resources the state confiscated 320 wells and had plugged 280 as of May at a cost of $39.3 million including $6.1 million that came from a state well-plugging fund financed with industry fees and penalties and taxes on production. The state “reclaimed”—or cleaned up—only 173 of the sites.

But so far the state has confiscated bonds worth only about $3.4 million while it is pursuing another $1.5 million through civil action Helms said. All of that money would go to reimburse the state fund rather than the CARES Act money. Helms said that while they are still looking into it the rules of the CARES Act may dictate that the state cannot or should not reimburse the federal government.

The department said that seven companies responsible for 77 of the confiscated wells have either entered bankruptcy or were determined to be insolvent. The rest of the wells however were owned by companies that continue to pump oil in the state.

Cobra Oil and Gas for example had 121 wells confiscated. State records say the Texas-based company has another 369 active wells suggesting there may have been revenue to cover plugging costs. Cobra did not respond to phone messages or emails.

Helms said companies like Cobra “are not off the hook” adding “I don’t think I can tell you that we’re going to pursue full reimbursement but I think I can commit we’re going to pursue at least some reimbursement from those companies.”

Helms said the North Dakota Legislature has made changes in bonding and regulations in recent years that are intended to prevent the 14000 wells that have been drilled in North Dakota over the past decade from facing a similar fate. Wells that have been idled for 18 months for example are now required to have dedicated bonds rather than being covered by a “blanket bond” for all of a company’s wells in the state.

Wyoming also sent CARES Act funds as grants to oil companies which they could use to frack wells they had already drilled or to plug older wells. According to data provided by the Wyoming Business Council which administered the funds Devon Energy received nearly $5.8 million which it used both to frack new wells and plug old ones. Six other companies including Occidental Petroleum received more than $1 million each.

Randall Luthi chief energy advisor to Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement to Inside Climate News that the spending was “completely appropriate” adding that thousands of people in the state were unable to find work last year. He said the program provided “an economic and environmental shot in the arm for Wyoming at a time when it was needed” and that “CARES money was always intended for solvent but struggling companies.”

Neither Devon Occidental nor Continental Resources responded to requests for comment.

Skokos of the Dakota Resource Council said he supported cleaning up old wells but that the way it was administered was “basically a bailout for the industry.”

“We could have been using that money for other things like paid family leave or money for actual workers increasing unemployment” he said. “There’s people that were struggling.”

Adam Peltz a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund said it was unlikely that any federal efforts to plug orphaned wells would be spent on wells with solvent owners as it was in North Dakota and Wyoming.

“The overwhelming vast majority of this money will be spent on pre-regulatory wells that really have not a trace of an owner on record” he said. Pennsylvania Ohio and other eastern states where some of the first oil wells were drilled for example have hundreds of thousands of orphaned wells and little funding to plug them. “And they’re just going to sit there as pollution vectors” Peltz said “until and unless we come up with a lot of money to plug them. The good news is we’re in a moment where money is flowing for good causes.”

He noted that some states including North Dakota have also begun to improve their bonding requirements.

But Reisch of the Center for International Environmental Law warned that those changes have hardly begun closing the gap.

“The looming legacy of the oil and gas industry and of the fossil fuel economy is really going to be this ghost infrastructure and these toxic wells” she said. “The magnitude of the problem and the funds needed to address it properly is really daunting.”

But the project slated for completion in 2023 has another big winner: the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery near Dickinson 200 miles to the west and along the same rail line.

Marathon has converted the refinery so that its entire production now involves making renewable diesel a fuel that is equivalent to conventional diesel but with a much lower carbon footprint that is increasingly in demand especially in California which offers financial incentives for low-carbon fuels.

And a major feedstock for the renewable diesel — sometimes called green diesel — at Marathon’s Dickinson refinery will be soybean oil from the Archer Daniels Midland Co. refinery in Spiritwood according to officials including a legislative leader.

Marathon has not publicly disclosed any plans to use soybean oil feedstock from the ADM plant once available but when the soybean plant was announced Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goerhing said plans called for the soybean oil to be shipped to a refinery in western North Dakota to make renewable fuel.

Only one refinery fits that description — the Marathon refinery near Dickinson said David Ripplinger an economist at North Dakota State University who studies biofuels.

Also Sen. Rich Wardner R-Dickinson the majority leader of the North Dakota Senate said local officials in Dickinson recently were briefed by Marathon about its plans to use soybean oil from the Spiritwood processing plant.

“They’re looking forward to doing business with that ADM plant at Spiritwood” he said.

Marathon has disclosed plans to buy wind power from five turbines that will provide 45% of the Dickinson refinery’s electricity.

A Marathon spokesman declined to comment on plans to use ADM soybean oil in its plant but Marathon previously has announced that the Dickinson refinery will use corn and soybeans to make renewable diesel. “We don’t typically provide comment on those types of commercial matters” Marathon communication manager Jamal Kheiry said referring to its fuel feedstock source.

Using wind power will help reduce the carbon footprint of the renewable diesel the refinery produces — entitling it to carbon credits from the state of California that will increase profitability Ripplinger said.

“That really helps their carbon footprint and it increases the price of the product” Wardner said. “They get premium dollar for their product because it practically has no carbon footprint at all.”

Also the ADM soybean processing plant in Spiritwood will use waste steam from the Dakota Spirit ethanol plant a neighboring facility at the 550-acre Spiritwood Energy Park 10 miles east of Jamestown.

That likely would further reduce the carbon footprint of green diesel that will be produced at the Marathon refinery Ripplinger said making the association between the refinery and the soybean plant highly advantageous.

“It’s a great opportunity for North Dakota farmers” he said. “It’s a great opportunity for ADM and Marathon. It’s a really great deal.”

Wardner agreed and noted the two plants are not far apart and are connected to the same rail line which will decrease shipping costs for the soybean oil used to make green diesel. “It’s ideal” he said.

Besides its low-carbon footprint green diesel offers other advantages over biodiesel because it is equivalent to petroleum diesel Wardner and Ripplinger said. That means vehicles that run on diesel don’t have to be converted to burn green diesel and the same tanks and pipelines can be used to store or carry both fuels.

“It seems like the renewable diesel is really getting to be sought after” Wardner said.

The refining industry is making a huge shift toward green diesel moving away from biodiesel Ripplinger said.

“It’s going to expand” he said. “That’s what everybody’s looking at. You’re going to see a tremendous increase in renewable diesel.”

The production capacity of the refinery and soybean crushing plant suggests that the Marathon refinery will be a major customer of the ADM plant Ripplinger said.

The soybean crushing plant will be able to process up to 150000 bushels per day and the refinery can produce 12000 barrels of renewable diesel per day.

“It matches almost perfectly” he said. “Absolutely everything points in that direction” meaning a close relationship between the refinery and soybean plant.

Soybean oil is the leading feedstock for renewable diesel Ripplinger said but other vegetable oils including canola oil as well as animal fats can be used.

The industry is moving away from conventional biofuels including biodiesel and toward green diesel because the incentives increase profitability. But the refining process to make renewable diesel equivalent to petroleum processing is much more involved and capital intensive so it requires a higher return Ripplinger said.

The ADM plant will provide a market for about 25% of the soybeans North Dakota grows Ripplinger said and likely will capture essentially all of the soybeans within a 100-mile radius of the plant.

The big shift toward green diesel and the popularity of soybeans as a feedstock mean that in the coming years there likely will be more refineries dedicated to producing renewable diesel Ripplinger said. It’s possible that another plant could be built on the northern Plains but it’s not clear whether North Dakota would be chosen he said.

Last year North Dakota was ranked ninth in the nation among soybean growing states producing 190 million bushels. North Dakota is the second-ranked petroleum state behind Texas and ranks 10th in wind energy production.

North Dakota also is making significant investments to try to make it economically feasible to capture and store carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants. Some of the carbon emissions could be used to help pump oil from North Dakota’s Bakken formation.

“Things like this kind of put North Dakota in the center of the universe” Ripplinger said.

Now most of North Dakota’s soybeans are shipped overseas as a protein source. Having the Spiritwood crushing plant he said will enable North Dakota growers to capture more of the economic value of their crop.

For that reason Gov. Doug Burgum called the recent ADM announcement a “game-changer.” He also has predicted that the state’s agriculture and energy industries will increasingly overlap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuLWNydWRlLW9pbC1pbmR1c3RyeS1wcmVwYXJlcy1hcy1jYXBsaW5lLXBpcGVsaW5lLWNsb3Nlcy1pbi1vbi1mbGlwLWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Part of the Plan - Crude Oil Industry Prepares as Capline Pipeline Closes in on 'Flip Day',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://rbnenergy.com/part-of-the-plan-crude-oil-industry-prepares-as-capline-pipeline-closes-in-on-flip-day on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuLWNydWRlLW9pbC1pbmR1c3RyeS1wcmVwYXJlcy1hcy1jYXBsaW5lLXBpcGVsaW5lLWNsb3Nlcy1pbi1vbi1mbGlwLWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXRpZXMvbXVtYmFpL2JvbWJheS1oaWdoLWNvdXJ0LWp1ZGdlcy13b3JrLXRocm91Z2gtbWFyYXRob24taGVhcmluZ3MtbGF0ZS1pbnRvLXRoZS1uaWdodC9hcnRpY2xlMzQ2MjM4MTIuZWNl0gGQAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NpdGllcy9tdW1iYWkvYm9tYmF5LWhpZ2gtY291cnQtanVkZ2VzLXdvcmstdGhyb3VnaC1tYXJhdGhvbi1oZWFyaW5ncy1sYXRlLWludG8tdGhlLW5pZ2h0L2FydGljbGUzNDYyMzgxMi5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bombay HC judges work through marathon hearings late into the night,"May 22 2021 10:43 pm | Updated 11:25 pm IST - Mumbai:

It’s the annual summer vacation for the Bombay High Court but among the other judges hearing important matters Justice Shahrukh J. Kathawalla and Justice Surendra P. Tavade have been burning the midnight oil.

On May 21 the Bench along with its court staff heard matters till midnight and while granting relief to former Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh said “Since we would cease to be vacation judges at the stroke of 12 a.m. we adjourn the hearing to May 24” and directed the Maharashtra government to not arrest him till then.

Justice Kathawalla has a record of sorts in having heard matters till 3.30 a.m. in May 2018. He always ensures that the Bench he leads finishes each case that has been listed before it without looking at the clock.

Both judges did not take their customary one hour lunch break and had their snacks and beverages while hearing all the civil and criminal cases assigned to the Bench from May 15 through video conferencing.

The cases before them were a legal pot pourri with petitioners seeking interim bail plea child custody eviction or demolition of structures tree cutting issues related to coastal road development cases related to termination of pregnancy intellectual property and former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and Mr. Singh.

In the one week assigned to them the Bench took pains to talk to an octogenarian who was in the midst of a dispute between his son and his daughter through video conferencing. The court thoughtfully asked the senior citizen if he wanted to return to his native place to which he said that he had lived his whole life there and wouldn’t want to go back. Justice Kathawalla talked to the man’s son and said “Brothers and sisters should not fight. Money will come today and money will go tomorrow.”

The court also intervened in a matrimonial dispute where the judge talked to a 10-year-old girl through video conferencing and asked her name the school she was going to and if she would talk to her father. The girl said she did not want to talk to her father after he had sent her mother a divorce notice and broke down. Justice Kathawalla tried to cajole her and asked her to talk to her father and express what she felt.

In another matrimonial dispute one of the parties was seeking child visitation rights. Apart from taking the contentions put forth by lawyers Justice Kathawalla had an in-person chat with the husband and wife regarding the custody of a 7-year-old autistic child.

It was probably a first at the Bombay High Court when Justice Kathawalla insisted that he wanted to talk to Professor Hany Babu who is admitted in a COVID-19 ward at G.T. Hospital. It was only after seeing and talking to Mr. Babu along with the hospital staff that the Bench directed he be shifted to Breach Candy Hospital.

The court also directed that the 84-year-old Jesuit priest Father Stan Swamy lodged at Taloja Central Jail be produced before him through video conferencing.

After the marathon hearing for the second time in the week on May 21 Justice Kathawalla said “We are facing criticism for sitting for such long hours. But what to do? Sticks and stones are thrown only at trees that bear fruits.”",,,

Only one however by Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) would require oil companies to purchase more expensive bonds when drilling on federal land leaving more money available in case of default.

Lynn Helms director of North Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources defended the state’s program from criticism that it bailed out the industry saying it targeted companies that were facing financial stress because of last year’s crash in oil prices and that in some cases small mom-and-pop operations did not have the funds to plug the wells. He said his department has begun to pursue reimbursement from some of the companies that are still solvent and has already obtained more than $3 million to reimburse a state well-plugging fund that covered some costs beyond the $66 million from the CARES Act.

He said the program served the intent of the CARES Act—to stimulate the economy and support employment—by creating more than 3700 jobs “and that was the number one purpose for why we did this.”

Helms said the $16 million in grants for fracking was also intended to support workers and state finances which are highly dependent on tax revenues from oil production. The grants he said supported about 600 jobs and boosted production in December shoring up funding for schools and other programs. While he acknowledged that Continental and other companies were essentially given a multi-million dollar discount “that wasn’t the purpose” he said.

Some environmental advocates have countered that whatever the intent North Dakota effectively gave the oil industry a backdoor subsidy and sent an implicit signal that taxpayers will come to its rescue when times are tough.

“In North Dakota I think the story is in some ways a fairly succinct one” said Nikki Reisch director of the climate and energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law which highlighted the state’s program in a recent report. “Taxpayer dollars were being used to pick up polluters’ tabs while at the same the state was repurposing federal funds to support new fracking making the very same problem worse.”

’Pollution Vectors’

No one knows how many old wells are scattered across the nation’s oil and gas fields. According to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission states have identified nearly 57000 orphaned wells but estimate there are hundreds of thousands more undocumented ones. The EPA has estimated there are more than 3 million abandoned wells regardless of whether they have owners or not. Often companies can avoid plugging wells when they are no longer productive by calling them idled a status that can last decades.

Locally old wells can contaminate groundwater and foul farmland spewing not only petroleum but also toxic highly salty water. Abandoned well sites render sections of farmers’ fields unusable.

Companies are generally required to purchase bonds when they drill wells as a form of insurance—governments can confiscate the bonds if companies fail to plug their own wells. Lawmakers or regulators determine the levels for those bonds—for example $10000 per well or $150000 for all a company’s wells within a state—but in many cases those levels were set decades ago and barely begin to cover plugging costs.

Carbon Tracker has collected data on more than 2.4 million catalogued unplugged wells including all the nation’s active wells and has estimated it would cost about $288 billion to plug them. But its analysis showed that state and federal bonds would cover only about 1 percent of that cost raising the question of who will pay the difference if companies go bankrupt or fail to plug their wells. That estimate for the coverage of bonds excluded Texas for which Carbon Tracker was unable to obtain data. Last week New Mexico’s State Land Office released a report that found that oil company bonds in the state covered 2 percent of the expected cleanup costs falling $8.1 billion short.

Rob Schuwerk executive director of Carbon Tracker’s North American office said the looming transition away from oil and gas will make the problem worse. It is one thing if industry revenues are stable or growing and companies only occasionally bail on their cleanup responsibilities. But if oil and gas demand begins to decline the industry is likely to face falling revenues and a spike in bankruptcies just as companies abandon a wave of unprofitable wells. They might not have money to plug their own wells leaving taxpayers on the hook.

Last year served as a preview when global lockdowns sent oil demand plummeting. In North Dakota that meant oil companies had to shut their wells and layoff workers as their revenues dwindled.

The conditions prompted warnings of bankruptcies and led regulators to ask the state to spend CARES Act relief funds on plugging and remediating abandoned wells which they warned could become orphaned if not addressed.

In order to plug the wells the state had to assume ownership of them a step that was welcomed by Ron Ness who runs the North Dakota Petroleum Council which represents the industry. But at a state hearing last year Ness warned regulators against also seizing the bonds companies had bought as insurance for plugging the wells. Although the bonds might help pay plugging costs seizing them would have “very real” impacts that would prove to be “extremely problematic” Ness said.

Ness argued that the CARES Act was effectively reimbursing the state for the cost of plugging the wells. If regulators did seize the bonds he argued the state could have to return funds to the federal government.

The petroleum council did not respond to phone messages or emails. But Schuwerk said that confiscating a bond could pose problems for the company that purchased it. Bond companies could suddenly view that company as a risk and require it to pay higher premiums for its other bonds for example driving up drilling costs.

Regulators have largely granted Ness’s request at least so far. According to data provided by the Department of Mineral Resources the state confiscated 320 wells and had plugged 280 as of May at a cost of $39.3 million including $6.1 million that came from a state well-plugging fund financed with industry fees and penalties and taxes on production. The state “reclaimed”—or cleaned up—only 173 of the sites.

But so far the state has confiscated bonds worth only about $3.4 million while it is pursuing another $1.5 million through civil action Helms said. All of that money would go to reimburse the state fund rather than the CARES Act money. Helms said that while they are still looking into it the rules of the CARES Act may dictate that the state cannot or should not reimburse the federal government.

The department said that seven companies responsible for 77 of the confiscated wells have either entered bankruptcy or were determined to be insolvent. The rest of the wells however were owned by companies that continue to pump oil in the state.

Cobra Oil and Gas for example had 121 wells confiscated. State records say the Texas-based company has another 369 active wells suggesting there may have been revenue to cover plugging costs. Cobra did not respond to phone messages or emails.

Helms said companies like Cobra “are not off the hook” adding “I don’t think I can tell you that we’re going to pursue full reimbursement but I think I can commit we’re going to pursue at least some reimbursement from those companies.”

Helms said the North Dakota Legislature has made changes in bonding and regulations in recent years that are intended to prevent the 14000 wells that have been drilled in North Dakota over the past decade from facing a similar fate. Wells that have been idled for 18 months for example are now required to have dedicated bonds rather than being covered by a “blanket bond” for all of a company’s wells in the state.

Wyoming also sent CARES Act funds as grants to oil companies which they could use to frack wells they had already drilled or to plug older wells. According to data provided by the Wyoming Business Council which administered the funds Devon Energy received nearly $5.8 million which it used both to frack new wells and plug old ones. Six other companies including Occidental Petroleum received more than $1 million each.

Randall Luthi chief energy advisor to Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement to Inside Climate News that the spending was “completely appropriate” adding that thousands of people in the state were unable to find work last year. He said the program provided “an economic and environmental shot in the arm for Wyoming at a time when it was needed” and that “CARES money was always intended for solvent but struggling companies.”

Neither Devon Occidental nor Continental Resources responded to requests for comment.

Skokos of the Dakota Resource Council said he supported cleaning up old wells but that the way it was administered was “basically a bailout for the industry.”

“We could have been using that money for other things like paid family leave or money for actual workers increasing unemployment” he said. “There’s people that were struggling.”

Adam Peltz a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund said it was unlikely that any federal efforts to plug orphaned wells would be spent on wells with solvent owners as it was in North Dakota and Wyoming.

“The overwhelming vast majority of this money will be spent on pre-regulatory wells that really have not a trace of an owner on record” he said. Pennsylvania Ohio and other eastern states where some of the first oil wells were drilled for example have hundreds of thousands of orphaned wells and little funding to plug them. “And they’re just going to sit there as pollution vectors” Peltz said “until and unless we come up with a lot of money to plug them. The good news is we’re in a moment where money is flowing for good causes.”

He noted that some states including North Dakota have also begun to improve their bonding requirements.

But Reisch of the Center for International Environmental Law warned that those changes have hardly begun closing the gap.

“The looming legacy of the oil and gas industry and of the fossil fuel economy is really going to be this ghost infrastructure and these toxic wells” she said. “The magnitude of the problem and the funds needed to address it properly is really daunting.”

But the project slated for completion in 2023 has another big winner: the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery near Dickinson 200 miles to the west and along the same rail line.

Marathon has converted the refinery so that its entire production now involves making renewable diesel a fuel that is equivalent to conventional diesel but with a much lower carbon footprint that is increasingly in demand especially in California which offers financial incentives for low-carbon fuels.

And a major feedstock for the renewable diesel — sometimes called green diesel — at Marathon’s Dickinson refinery will be soybean oil from the Archer Daniels Midland Co. refinery in Spiritwood according to officials including a legislative leader.

Marathon has not publicly disclosed any plans to use soybean oil feedstock from the ADM plant once available but when the soybean plant was announced Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goerhing said plans called for the soybean oil to be shipped to a refinery in western North Dakota to make renewable fuel.

Only one refinery fits that description — the Marathon refinery near Dickinson said David Ripplinger an economist at North Dakota State University who studies biofuels.

Also Sen. Rich Wardner R-Dickinson the majority leader of the North Dakota Senate said local officials in Dickinson recently were briefed by Marathon about its plans to use soybean oil from the Spiritwood processing plant.

“They’re looking forward to doing business with that ADM plant at Spiritwood” he said.

Marathon has disclosed plans to buy wind power from five turbines that will provide 45% of the Dickinson refinery’s electricity.

A Marathon spokesman declined to comment on plans to use ADM soybean oil in its plant but Marathon previously has announced that the Dickinson refinery will use corn and soybeans to make renewable diesel. “We don’t typically provide comment on those types of commercial matters” Marathon communication manager Jamal Kheiry said referring to its fuel feedstock source.

Using wind power will help reduce the carbon footprint of the renewable diesel the refinery produces — entitling it to carbon credits from the state of California that will increase profitability Ripplinger said.

“That really helps their carbon footprint and it increases the price of the product” Wardner said. “They get premium dollar for their product because it practically has no carbon footprint at all.”

Also the ADM soybean processing plant in Spiritwood will use waste steam from the Dakota Spirit ethanol plant a neighboring facility at the 550-acre Spiritwood Energy Park 10 miles east of Jamestown.

That likely would further reduce the carbon footprint of green diesel that will be produced at the Marathon refinery Ripplinger said making the association between the refinery and the soybean plant highly advantageous.

“It’s a great opportunity for North Dakota farmers” he said. “It’s a great opportunity for ADM and Marathon. It’s a really great deal.”

Wardner agreed and noted the two plants are not far apart and are connected to the same rail line which will decrease shipping costs for the soybean oil used to make green diesel. “It’s ideal” he said.

Besides its low-carbon footprint green diesel offers other advantages over biodiesel because it is equivalent to petroleum diesel Wardner and Ripplinger said. That means vehicles that run on diesel don’t have to be converted to burn green diesel and the same tanks and pipelines can be used to store or carry both fuels.

“It seems like the renewable diesel is really getting to be sought after” Wardner said.

The refining industry is making a huge shift toward green diesel moving away from biodiesel Ripplinger said.

“It’s going to expand” he said. “That’s what everybody’s looking at. You’re going to see a tremendous increase in renewable diesel.”

The production capacity of the refinery and soybean crushing plant suggests that the Marathon refinery will be a major customer of the ADM plant Ripplinger said.

The soybean crushing plant will be able to process up to 150000 bushels per day and the refinery can produce 12000 barrels of renewable diesel per day.

“It matches almost perfectly” he said. “Absolutely everything points in that direction” meaning a close relationship between the refinery and soybean plant.

Soybean oil is the leading feedstock for renewable diesel Ripplinger said but other vegetable oils including canola oil as well as animal fats can be used.

The industry is moving away from conventional biofuels including biodiesel and toward green diesel because the incentives increase profitability. But the refining process to make renewable diesel equivalent to petroleum processing is much more involved and capital intensive so it requires a higher return Ripplinger said.

The ADM plant will provide a market for about 25% of the soybeans North Dakota grows Ripplinger said and likely will capture essentially all of the soybeans within a 100-mile radius of the plant.

The big shift toward green diesel and the popularity of soybeans as a feedstock mean that in the coming years there likely will be more refineries dedicated to producing renewable diesel Ripplinger said. It’s possible that another plant could be built on the northern Plains but it’s not clear whether North Dakota would be chosen he said.

Last year North Dakota was ranked ninth in the nation among soybean growing states producing 190 million bushels. North Dakota is the second-ranked petroleum state behind Texas and ranks 10th in wind energy production.

North Dakota also is making significant investments to try to make it economically feasible to capture and store carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants. Some of the carbon emissions could be used to help pump oil from North Dakota’s Bakken formation.

“Things like this kind of put North Dakota in the center of the universe” Ripplinger said.

Now most of North Dakota’s soybeans are shipped overseas as a protein source. Having the Spiritwood crushing plant he said will enable North Dakota growers to capture more of the economic value of their crop.

For that reason Gov. Doug Burgum called the recent ADM announcement a “game-changer.” He also has predicted that the state’s agriculture and energy industries will increasingly overlap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuLWNydWRlLW9pbC1pbmR1c3RyeS1wcmVwYXJlcy1hcy1jYXBsaW5lLXBpcGVsaW5lLWNsb3Nlcy1pbi1vbi1mbGlwLWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Part of the Plan - Crude Oil Industry Prepares as Capline Pipeline Closes in on 'Flip Day',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://rbnenergy.com/part-of-the-plan-crude-oil-industry-prepares-as-capline-pipeline-closes-in-on-flip-day on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuLWNydWRlLW9pbC1pbmR1c3RyeS1wcmVwYXJlcy1hcy1jYXBsaW5lLXBpcGVsaW5lLWNsb3Nlcy1pbi1vbi1mbGlwLWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

I’m curious what OMAAT readers think…

How Marriott’s guaranteed welcome gift works

Marriott Bonvoy offers a few elite benefit guarantees which cover things like getting your preferred bed type having your reservation honored etc. These had been suspended for a limited time during coronavirus but were reinstated at the beginning of 2021.

Arguably the most interesting guarantee centers around welcome gifts. Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Titanium and Ambassador members are entitled to a welcome gift when they check-in at a Marriott property. Choices range from points to breakfast to a gift to a food & beverage credit. As this policy is described:

As a Platinum or Titanium Elite member you’ll receive a special gift upon arrival at participating hotels with a choice of an amenity gift or points. If guarantee is not met guest compensation applies.

If the guarantee isn’t met Bonvoy members are entitled to compensation ranging from $25 to $100 depending on the brand (most full service brands promise $100 though this doesn’t apply at EDITION and Ritz-Carlton properties).

It’s also quite explicit in the Marriott Bonvoy terms that this is about being offered your welcome gift on arrival rather than just being offered it at some point during your stay:

If the Elite Welcome Gift is not offered at time of arrival compensation applies.

Marriott Bonvoy has a welcome gift guarantee

I wasn’t offered a welcome gift (for the first time)

Last night I checked into a Marriott family property and this morning I realized that I wasn’t offered a welcome gift. This is one benefit that Marriott seems to be consistent about because I don’t previously remember ever not being offered this.

So I’m entitled to $100 cash compensation full stop. But I don’t think I’m going to request that because I don’t understand how you could possibly exercise this without the situation being awkward as could be and without coming across as a complete jerk.

Based on what I’ve read from people who have used this guarantee in the past front desk agents (and even managers) are typically not familiar with this policy or at least pretend not to be familiar with it. The discussion apparently usually goes something like this:

“Hey so I checked in yesterday and wasn’t offered my welcome gift.”

“Oh I’m so sorry about that let me take care of that right now. Which did you want to select?”

“I’ll take the points please… and $100.”

“Sorry what?”

Most Marriott employees aren’t familiar with the policy and those that are apparently often try to argue that they can still offer the amenity while you’re on property or that they just “assumed” you wanted the points.

I feel like the way this is executed almost guarantees a really uncomfortable interaction and I don’t see how a hotel won’t strongly dislike a guest after they request this. After all the compensation isn’t really proportional to the “mistake.” As a matter of fact there’s no difference whether I’m offered my points at check-in or later during my stay since they’ll only post after my stay anyway.

I should also mention that the front desk agent checking me in was super friendly and professional and I was checking in late at night. I don’t want him to get in trouble or somehow penalized but that seems like it would probably happen if I pushed the issue. I wonder if I’d be less hesitant about this if the front desk agent was a jerk.

Is it awkward to request compensation over a non-issue or nah?

Bottom line

Marriott Bonvoy Platinum members and above are guaranteed a welcome gift. If a front desk agent doesn’t offer it at check-in you’re entitled to cash compensation of $25-100 depending on the type of property.

While the benefit sounds great on paper taking advantage of it is a whole different story. I can’t help but feel like a jerk for requesting the $100 I’m technically entitled to for something that’s a non-issue and for that matter it’s probably not worth getting an evil glare for the reminder of my stay over this. But I’m also not sure if I’m just thinking about this wrong.

I’d love to hear how other Marriott Bonvoy members feel. Have you ever not been offered your welcome gift and if so did you request the compensation? How did it go?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWZyb21hbG91bmdlLmNvbS9yZWFkZXItc3VjY2Vzcy1zdG9yeS1tYXJyaW90dC1zdGF0dXMtbWF0Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reader Success Story: How work travel took this reader to Marriott Titanium Elite in no time,"We love to hear stories from our readers about how a passion for collecting miles and points and sharing all sorts of do-it-yourself information on our site has affected their lives. Honeymoon plans in the works celebrating an anniversary in the Maldives a gift to their parents a vacation to Srinagar or Singapore or just that premium airline seat that they secured on redemption. We’ve heard many such stories and this year we are trying to share more of these stories with you.

One of the biggest debates people have with me is about hotel status. So this time around we highlight a story from reader Jitu Hemlani who layered a few technicalities to get quick status with Marriott. Read on.

Editor’s note: The events in this article occurred before the second wave of the pandemic in India. At this time we don’t advise you to travel unless necessary.

Towards the end of 2020 I came across an article on LiveFromALounge.com about a status challenge for Marriott Bonvoy Platinum was available based on other hotel’s loyalty program status and providing a copy of a folio of stay with that hotel chain within the last 12 months.

Status Matching from Hilton Gold to Marriott Platinum Elite

I became Hilton Honors Gold by staying at two different hotels and paying with Visa Infinite card in 2019. Hilton extended the Hilton Honors status in 2020 as most hotel chains did. I had no stay with them in the previous 12 months. In November 2020 I had to travel for a night and decided to book Hilton so I could use that to take up the Marriott Bonvoy Platinum status challenge.

Within a couple of days of applying I received a confirmation email stating that Marriott Bonvoy had provided me with 90 days of Platinum Elite status.

During this period I had to stay 15 nights to continue as a Platinum till February 2023. My work-related travel had started in December (2020). So I was sure I would be able to do at least Gold with a stay of 8 nights but still wasn’t confident of finishing 15 nights. So I made sure that even if there was a 1-night stay during any of my trips it would be at a Marriott to complete the status challenge.

I travelled to Mumbai and Delhi and a couple of stays for some work in Ahmedabad as well. During this time most of my stays were at:

Courtyard by Marriott Mumbai

Four Points by Sheraton Ahmedabad

Four Points by Sheraton Delhi

Le Meridien Gurgaon

Usually I would book hotels closer to my work area. However I would stay at a Marriott property during these three months even though I had to travel more. The hotels were running on low occupancy and had offers running most of the time. For each of my stays I could book between INR 2200 to INR 3700 per night including taxes. So I wasn’t spending any additional money to stay at these hotels. It was lower than what I would pay at my usual stay hotels in some cases.

I also used a voucher for a 30% discount on the room rate for Club Marriott membership which is complimentary with HDFC Diners Club Black annual benefits. The 20-30% discounted nights for Club Marriott members counts towards elite nights. Unfortunately I realised this only when two nights were left in my status challenge.

During this period all the hotels provided me with the perks of a Platinum Elite guest. All stays were upgraded to a suite room. There wasn’t any request needed. All these hotels acknowledged the perks associated with a Platinum guest. Sometimes even before check-in while pulling up the reservation on the Marriott app I would notice the room has been upgraded already.

After finishing the 15 stays I received an email from Bonvoy confirming my Platinum status till February 2023.

From Platinum Elite to Titanium Elite

The only drawback to this challenge was I didn’t get the 50% bonus nights credits of 2020. I should have received another five nights due to my last year’s silver status with Marriott Bonvoy. On following up I found out anyone who had taken up a status challenge before December 31 2020 and was still pending to be completed wouldn’t receive these bonus nights.

However a week later I got an additional 25 nights bonus credit; this was towards 50% bonus nights of Platinum elite status as of 2020. The status challenge that I completed was actually taken up in November 2020. When the status was achieved they gave me a bonus of 25 nights considering my status as Platinum Elite in 2020. I had no idea regarding this nor was I informed when I called the Marriott Bonvoy team to credit five bonus nights for my silver status in 2020.

This bonus credit had taken my total nights to 53. A couple of days later I received another email asking me to select an annual benefit on crossing 50-night stays. I picked additional five elite night credit taking it to a total of 58 nights. I wasn’t keen on achieving Titanium Elite status till now but this extra 30-night bonus made the target relatively closer.

Marriott Bonvoy launched a new Double Points and Elite Night credit promotion as soon as my status challenge was completed. Since then I stayed another seven nights counting as 14 nights and trying for Titanium Elite as double elite night credits made it easy. Also the double elite night offer was valid till 27 April; I just had to stay another nine nights to become Titanium Elite.

I already had a three-night stay in Kochi while travelling to Kerala for a vacation with my family. During this trip I stayed at Le Meridien Kochi & Kochi Marriott. In March-April’20 I had two more work trips for which I stayed at Westin Gurgaon and Courtyard Mumbai Airport. All these stays too were upgraded to suites upon arrival. The Platinum Elite status was acknowledged and I was provided with complimentary breakfast and late checkout.

My actual stays were for 32 nights and 47 nights were received as a bonus. On achieving Titanium Elite another annual benefit was offered for which I selected one free night certificate which will be valid till December 2022.

Conclusion

I remember my first Mileage Mentor MasterClass with you guys in Mumbai in 2018 where I was introduced to hotel loyalty; until then I wouldn’t bother about it much. I want to thank you guys for sharing your experiences and giving insights regarding this.

In one of your tweets you mentioned that loyalty isn’t about the perks or benefits. It’s about how those perks and benefits make you feel. I realise this as I write to you on the last day of my 4-days stay at the Westin Gurgaon from a 700+ sqft suite room that I got upgraded to as one of the perks of being an Elite guest.

Fortunately covid cases were low when I travelled during the first quarter of this year and the double elite night credit made it reasonably easy. I haven’t travelled after the first week of April 2021. That is when things started getting worse. The elite status is valid till February 2023. Hopefully travelling will return to normal in 2022 and I would be able to use the benefits of this status.

Adyen provides end-to-end infrastructure connecting directly to Visa Mastercard and consumers’ globally preferred payment methods to deliver frictionless payments across online mobile and in-store channels.

This is the sixth and final article in a series that will predict the outcome of all Euro 2020 groups. Containing hosts Hungary and Germany along with world champions France and European champions Portugal it’s been labelled the ‘group of death’ for a reason.

Euro 2020 Group F Predictions

Hungary’s Chances Bleak Despite Packed Home Stadiums

Hungary impressively won their Nations League B group but that is of little significance in a Euro group with teams who all performed well or at least decently in League A.

However the Magyars have an ace up their sleeve in being the only Euro 2020 team with full stadium capacity. As a result 67215 spectators (mostly Hungarians) will cheer them on at the Puskás Aréna. Interestingly enough a study conducted by the Institute of Labor Economics found that the absence of football fans did not negatively affect home advantage. In other words Hungary’s performance might not improve despite their packed stadiums.

There are a few reasons why this study should be taken with a grain of salt in this context.

For one the study was conducted all the way back in August and could thus potentially be outdated. Secondly while it’s indicative of empty stadiums not negatively affecting home advantage that doesn’t necessarily have to mean home teams won’t get a boost of a big home crowd after having been accustomed to playing in empty stadiums for several months.

France’s away record is impeccable having won their eight most recent matches abroad.

This includes wins against Sweden Croatia and Portugal. Speaking of whom Portugal’s away record is a little shakier recently dropping a 2-0 lead to a draw against Serbia. But it’s worth noting that a last-minute winner by Cristiano Ronaldo was wrongfully disallowed. Not to mention that one fixture is anecdotal. The Portuguese also reigned supreme against Sweden and Croatia in the Nations League.

Hungary’s stadium capacity makes them unpredictable. It’s possible they get a shock win against France or Portugal in Budapest but it’s unlikely. What’s more probable is that Hungary’s home advantage merely mitigates the margin with which Le Bleus and A Seleção beat them.

And since Germany’s loss to North Macedonia likely was a (deserved) fluke Hungary’s final group match in Munich against die Mannschaft will presumably spell the end of the Magyars tournament.

France Euro 2020 Group F Favourites

The French have a splendid away record combined with Germany’s recent struggles should grant Le Bleus a win against die Mannschaft even in Munich. Not to mention Le Bleus are one of if not the best teams in the world. The same is true when it comes to France’s match against Hungary in Budapest but by an even greater margin.

Portugal and France are arguably evenly matched despite the latters’ narrow Nations League win in Lisbon. But France’s slightly better consistency will likely grant them a higher point tally than Portugal.

Portugal to Clinch Second Place

Portugal should be favoured to beat Hungary even though the task will be hard. Regardless this is one of the strongest Portuguese sides of all time. Additionally citing their superior Nations League campaign and start to World Cup qualifying Portugal would be marginal favourites away against Germany. A German draw or win certainly is within the realm of possibility though.

Germany Fortunate to Have Home Advantage

Germany did lose at home to North Macedonia but that doesn’t mean they’ll succumb to Hungary in Munich. One match is too anecdotal. The German’s home record was respectable prior to that disaster. With wins against Iceland and a strong Ukrainian side. Their draws against Spain and especially Switzerland might seem poor at first glance but they’re both better than Hungary and thus indicates that a German win against the Magyars is probable.

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why."

Over 50 protesters have blockaded four McDonald’s (MCD) UK distribution centers and are calling for the world’s largest fast-food chain to become entirely plant-based by 2025.

Animal Rebellion is stopping workers from accessing four sites across England using trucks beacons and bamboo towers with people locked into concrete blocks at the base said the climate and animal justice movement Saturday.

“We believe that putting pressure on one of the largest and most iconic corporations in the world who are responsible for significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation can have an impact” a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion Alex Lockwood told CNN over the phone Saturday. The group is asking McDonald’s to transition to a plant-based food system to “stop the climate crisis and end the suffering of animals” it said in a statement.

The activists plan to blockade the distribution centers for at least 24 hours but will try to stay for 48 said Lockwood. The bamboo structures will be difficult for police and workers to remove because of the protesters locked into the base.

Animal Rebellion has parked trucks outside the centers with messages attached reading “Meat & Dairy = Climate Crisis” and “Plant-Based Food System.” The blockade will affect around 1300 restaurants and 3.5 million customers according to the activist group.

“We want to shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the sustainability measures of McDonald’s and how they claim to have science-backed emissions targets while ignoring how unrealistic they are when they continue to serve the menu they serve” said Harley McDonald-Eckersall a 23-year-old who volunteers full-time with Animal Rebellion. “We want to open up a conversation with them.”

McDonald-Eckersall began protesting at a McDonald’s distribution center at Hemel Hempstead a town northwest of London at 5 a.m. local time (midnight ET). Police arrived on the scene around three hours later McDonald-Eckersall told CNN but she added the atmosphere was “very relaxed.”

We’ve had really positive conversations with workers lots of them taking selfies with the clown car and big burger so that’s been enjoyable” she said. “People are open to hearing why we’re here.”

Animal Rebellion a sister group to the environmental movement Extinction Rebellion has not yet heard from McDonald’s McDonald-Eckersall said.

The American corporation said its distribution centers were facing disruption. “We are assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items” a McDonald’s spokesperson told CNN. “We apologise to our customers for any disappointment caused.”

The spokesperson declined to say whether McDonald’s would open a dialogue with Animal Rebellion.

McDonald’s expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 150 million tons by 2030 and co-founded the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef in 2011 which aims to improve the sustainability of the global beef supply chain.

Francesca DeBlase head of McDonald’s global supply chain wrote in a CNN opinion piece in September that reducing emissions has to be the food industry’s “number one priority.”

Police have also arrived at the other protest sites at distribution centers in Basingstoke Coventry and Heywood said Lockwood. Workers tried to remove activists at the Heywood plant but police are now keeping the situation calm there he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrMmhvdXN0b24uY29tL2Zvb2QvMjAyMS8wNS8yMi9tY2RvbmFsZHMtcm9sbGluZy1vdXQtNS1mcm96ZW4tZHJpbmtzLXRoaXMtc3VtbWVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's rolling out 5 frozen drinks this summer,"HOUSTON – Participating McDonald’s in Houston are rolling out five frozen drinks this summer the restaurant chain announced this week.

The day before its annual general meeting on May 20th Fight for $15 an advocacy group organised a strike of McDonald’s workers in 15 cities across America. The strike went ahead despite the firm’s vow a week earlier to raise wages. The company said that its 36500 in-house employees will get a rise of 10% on average that entry-level wages for new hires would go from $11 to $17 an hour and that average wages for all staff paid by the hour would reach $15 by 2024. It added that it wants to hire 10000 people for the 650 restaurants it owns outright over the next three months.

McDonald’s followed Chipotle and Olive Garden two other restaurant chains that recently announced wage increases while they try to recruit staff as America reopens for business. The fast-food giant has room to reinvest in labour says Sara Senatore at Bernstein a broker. It reported growth of same-store sales in America of 14% in the first quarter year on year thanks to a boom in online orders.

That might impress some women. But the Lagunitas resident was chatting up Anne Lamott the celebrated and beloved best-selling author of nearly 20 books a former Guggenheim Fellow and California Hall of Fame inductee and the subject of a 1999 documentary. Anne Lamott with more than 240000 followers on Twitter and a fan Twitter profile dedicated to sharing Lamott’s quotes and musings with almost 32000 followers. Anne Lamott with more than 601000 followers on Facebook where her posts get liked commented on and shared hundreds of times.

That Anne Lamott.

“He sent me a description of it and I really didn’t know what to make of it. I just found it all very alarming” Lamott says with a laugh. “I could tell by his description that he was way way way too educated for me who’s a dropout.”

Despite her gut feeling that his book might be approaching a level of New Age woo-woo they met for a date anyway at the Two Bird Cafe in San Geronimo. By the second cup of coffee Allen had put into practice what his book “Shapes of Truth: Discover God Inside You” (270 pages Pearl Publications $18.95) details in-depth — a little-known practice involving “body-forms” that represent a different characteristic of the divine that we have within us (our torsos to be exact) and that we can tap into for comfort support and meditation.

“On the first date he did this work that he does with these essential forms on me because I had shown up sort of twitterpated and he said ‘Oh I have this kind of parlor trick’ and he did it and I got it. It was not only real but incredibly helpful” says Lamott whose latest book is a collection of essays titled “Dusk Night Dawn: On Revival and Courage.”

‘Grokking’ each other

Whether or not that helped them fall in love is anyone’s guess. But fall in love they did and the two wed under the redwoods at Deer Park Villa about three years after that coffee date — her first marriage at age 65 and his third at age 63. “We grokked each other immediately” Lamott says. “We just immediately jibed.”

And now Allen’s book is being released on May 25 with an online book event through Book Passage at 5 p.m. May 27. The official book launch is at 7 p.m. May 26 through the Open Center.

Allen’s book is based in part on the discoveries of A.H. Almaas the pen name of A. Hameed Ali a founder of the Diamond Approach which seeks to help people become more curious about their lived experience and dive deeper into what’s happening in their body emotions and thought. His book offers tools and practices that he says on his website can “help you land a life that feels lighter more loving and less difficult.”

Allen sought to go the traditional publishing route but his book had been languishing with two publishers who had expressed an interest but did little with it and whatever they wanted to do with it wasn’t flying with him. The pandemic didn’t help as publishers nervously wondered what was ahead for the industry. So he bought back the rights to his book his first and has self-published it.

“I had already spent more time on this book than I wanted to” he says. “I just want to be done I just wanted to be published.”

Thrill of writing

Allen will admit that having his book his baby be rejected made him question his identity as a “supposedly successful person.

“It was a disappointment when I realized that’s where it was heading. I had to work through the disappointment” he says. “The odd thing is that I had ignored and dismissed Anne having said for all the years that I’ve known her before I ended up doing it myself ‘If I were to come up as an author today I would definitely self-publish.’ She knew what it is to be published by a big publishing house and get all the publicity and the book tours and sell lots of lots of books and become known.”

But he acknowledges the same thing happens no matter the publisher. “The point is publishing is all about publishing. I can’t even remember that little thrill that I was going to get a book out into the world. It’s why you write a book — it’s thrilling. The emotional impact of publishing is the same whether it’s self-published or a publisher.”

In the book’s forward Lamott expresses her initial anxiety about reading it “in case it was woo-woo overwrought esoteric pedantic intellectual or over-written.”

It was not.

In fact Lamott has nothing but praise for her husband’s writing.

“In the beginning in August 2016 and September 2016 when I knew he was a serious writer we exchanged something recent that we’d both written. His was a piece published in a quarterly and I was sick to my stomach reading it. I was so worried he wasn’t a good writer that I was going to have to pretend that he was or patronize him like when your child makes you an ashtray out of Sculpey” she says by phone from the home they share in Fairfax. “And it was really a beautiful piece of work. And I was flooded with relief.”

She isn’t the only one praising his writing. Kirkus Reviews describes his narrative style as “easy and readable throughout the earnest work” that “readers of spiritualist/New Age literature will find comforting inspiring and predictable.” ​Jack Kornfield a Buddhist teacher and one of the founders of Woodacre’s Spirit Rock notes that the book “offers simple and deep ways to find your inner wisdom and refresh your spirit.” Mirabai Starr a former adjunct professor of philosophy and world religions at the University of New Mexico-Taos and an author calls his book “smart and funny personal and universal.”

Still a marriage between two authors — one wildly famous and one a total unknown a former vice president for marketing at McKesson Corp. whose one and only book they admit will not make any sort of bestseller list — must create some complications if not downright jealousy.

Respect and trust

“I don’t think it would work if we didn’t strongly respect each other’s ability to write good sentences. We respect each other enough and trust each other enough we’re kind of each other’s first editors” Allen says. “We both look at writing as a serious craft and what happens to the work after it goes out is a separate issue.”

“We really disagree on some things as writers” Lamott adds “and there are things he knows not to bring up with me and there are ways of seeing things that I don’t always run by him. But we’re both hardcore writers and so if he gives me pages to read I’m going to mark them up as honestly as I can. I’m going to say ‘This lead is really woo-woo’ or ‘This lead is you clearing your throat’ and he’ll do the same with me. But I think both of us are pathetically grateful to have the other person calling us on our less-than-finished work work that could be better.”

Lamott hints about slowing down approaching some sort of retirement “whatever that would look like.”

Allen however has three more books that are all halfway to being finished.

There have no plans to collaborate on a book.

Before they met Lamott had been telling friends and family that one thing she really hoped to have one day was a good marriage. She has that now as well as a new book editor a bonus she hadn’t planned for.

Lamott had dated writers before — “They were just awful” she says with a laugh. They were competitive with her and Lamott is anything but competitive she says. Not with Allen though. “We’re very friendly toward each other especially with our vulnerabilities and that just covers a multitude of sins. It’s a different form of intimacy” she says. “You trust that they will love you more even because of the trust.”

WHY IT MATTERS

Traditional fingerstick glucose meters can only provide information about intermittent glucose levels and the pain that comes with finger pricking can potentially reduce patients' adherence. By inserting a sensor into the subcutaneous tissue along with a transmitter that sends the data to a smart device CGMs can provide continuous glucose information to detect glycemic variability.

According to a press release Metronom Health has developed a minimally invasive CGM system that uses proprietary Opto-enzymatic technology – in contrast to most CGMs that use electrochemical technology – to capture both high and low ranges of a patient's glucose profile. The company claims that this will be done with ""high"" accuracy and also asserts that its device's sensor may last up to 14 days and reduce patient discomfort and infection risk.

It was also mentioned in the statement that Opto-enzymatic CGM technology is ""designed to have an industry-leading cost profile which will allow broader use of the sensor"". Metronom is working to get the device approved by China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA).

An estimated 116 million adults were living with diabetes in China in 2019 according to the International Diabetes Federation. That number may rise to 140 million by 2023 it predicted.

""The huge diabetes patient population provides a broad market potential for innovative [CGM] technology"" said Serena Shao founder and managing partner of Ascendum Capital a healthcare-focused investment platform which backs Dinova Medtech on the joint venture.

MARKET SNAPSHOT

In a market study it was estimated that the CGM device market in China will surpass $405.5 million by 2027.

Among notable players is Medtronic which recently came up with a smart insulin pen that is integrated with its Guardian Connect CGM system. There is also Abbott with its FreeStyle Libre devices. Medtech giant Senseonic has also marketed its CGM product in China. Zhejiang POCTech based in Huzhou City is a local producer of a CGM system.

ON THE RECORD

""We are looking forward to collaborating with Metronom and sharing Metronom's passion for developing CGM technologies to serve the unmet medical needs of diabetic patients"" Dinova Medtech co-founder and CEO Michale Zhao said in a statement.

""We are pleased to partner with a highly regarded investor Ascendum Capital and also the strong operational organisation of Dinova for our [joint venture] in China. We will leverage our EU and US experience to seek NMPA approval to access the large market in China"" said Metronom Board Chairman Olav Bergheim.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On Monday Gossamer and the Italy-based Chiesi Farmaceutici announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and eventually sell the drug which is called seralutinib. Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known in short as PAH and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.

PAH or pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.

Unlike other treatments Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.

Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial titled “Prosera” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.

While Gossamer remains confident in its drug company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022 when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning they traded at about 75 cents apiece.

Joseph Schwartz an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns according to Schwartz is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.

The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration” the analyst wrote.

Story continues

Per deal terms Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs the former is responsible for financing Prosera.

In the U.S. the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.

Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales. Chiesi has agreed to pay Gossamer $160 million as a development reimbursement and may shell out up to $326 million more provided certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer."

SEOUL May 22 (Yonhap) -- As the pandemic fuels demand for online activities South Korean tech companies are bolstering efforts to develop ""metaverse"" platforms that allow users to shift their physical experiences to a virtual space.

Metaverse refers to a virtual space often incorporating augmented reality (AR) technology in which users interact with others through digital versions of themselves. The platforms can be found in the form of online games or social networking services.

SK Telecom Co. the largest mobile carrier partnered with K-pop girl group STAYC to produce digital versions of its members on its Jump AR mobile app allowing users to take photos or videos next to the members as if they were physically there.

The mobile carrier said the move is part of its K-pop metaverse project which aims to allow fans to interact with K-pop groups using the latest AR technology.

The telecom operator has recently taken steps to create alternate digital realities holding a welcoming ceremony for new students at Soon Chun Hyang University using digital avatars on its VR platform in March.

Telecom operators have been at the forefront of developing the technology as they see the data-intensive platforms as killer content for their high-speed 5G networks.

While South Korea commercialized 5G in April 2019 user migration from previous generation networks has been sluggish with 5G users accounting for around 20 percent of the country's total mobile subscriptions in March.

Other South Korean tech companies have also built up metaverse platforms betting on creating an alternate digital reality and have racked up substantial followings from the younger tech-savvy Generation Z.

Naver Z Corp. under the country's top online portal operator Naver Corp. launched its mobile-based metaverse platform Zepeto in 2018 which has over 200 million users globally as of February.

Zepeto allows users to create digital avatars based on their photos and to interact with others in a virtual world.

The platform has enjoyed popularity among teenagers globally with 80 percent of its users age 10 to 19 while 90 percent of its users are from outside South Korea.

Zepeto has quickly expanded with its own virtual economy where users can create their own digital items that can be sold online. The platform has even partnered with Gucci to offer the luxury brand's products within the virtual universe.

The company has also collaborated with K-pop girl group BLACKPINK allowing users to meet digital avatars of the group on the platform.

""Naver's Zepeto has been met with explosive popularity in early stages and is expected to grow into a next-generation platform"" Kiwoom Securities analyst Kim Hak-joon said. ""It has seen accelerating growth through multiple partnerships.""

Naver Z has drawn investment from major K-pop agencies including 5 billion won (US$4.4 million) from JYP Entertainment in November last year.

The broader tech industry in the country has also joined forces to develop metaverse projects launching an alliance made up of 17 companies including SK Telecom as well as auto giant Hyundai Motor Co. and eight industry groups.

We’ve seen trends come and go over the years on Twitch but the recent ‘hot tub meta’ has to be up there with the most controversial. Content creators simply stream from a hot tub – often indoors primarily because it allows them to wear a swimsuit in the context.

The trend was amassing thousands of viewers on Twitch but also criticism from some who said it was simply being used to exploit Twitch’s contextual exceptions to their sexually suggestive content policies.

On May 21 nearly two months after hot tub streams really took off Twitch confirmed the addition of a new ‘pools hot tubs and beaches’ category meaning hot tub streamers will no longer dominate the ‘Just Chatting’ section of the platform.

Unsplash/Twitch Hot Tub streams have become insanely popular on Twitch in 2021.

Alinity supports new category

The news largely received positive feedback from the community. Alinity streaming on May 21 joined those praises and described it as a “smart” thing for Twitch to do. However she also suggested that it could end the meta entirely.

“That is actually really good. That’s actually a really good thing you guys. It’s very smart of them [Twitch] to do that” she said. “Do you guys want the opinion of a person that’s been on Twitch for 8 years?

“Because I can give you my personal opinion on it: it’s gonna stop the meta. The reason why people do it is because of browser placement. Browser placement on a channel with 25000 viewers is not high enough for it to be worth streaming on. It’s a good thing.”

Topic occurs 3:15:00 to 3:18:30

Alinity is essentially arguing that the category and its placement on the Twitch home page will affect the popularity of the streams inside it with Just Chatting and other titles almost certain to feature more obviously.

Earlier this week Twitch removed advertisement monetisation from one of the platform’s top female streamers Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa after her streams were deemed “not advertiser-friendly” after she was taking part in the trend dubbed the “hot tub meta”.

The conversation has also caused confusion as Twitch has strict guidelines when it comes to sexually suggestive content and nudity on its platform.

However following the controversy Twitch has since released a new dedicated category called ‘Pools Hot Tubs and Beaches’.

In a new blog post Twitch said: “Over the past few weeks we’ve seen and had many conversations about Hot Tub streams and we want to address it candidly.”

While the streaming site has guidelines about sexually suggestive content Twitch has said that “being found to be sexy by others is not against our rules” and it “will not take action” against anyone for their “perceived attractiveness”.

The platform has also acknowledged the confusion however under the sites current ‘Nudity & Attire’ and ‘Sexually Suggestive Content’ policies streamers “may appear in swimwear in contextually appropriate situations” including at the beach or in a hot tub.

Twitch also explained that the platform had recently suspended advertising on a few channels that were flagged by a majority of their advertiser base and failed to notify them.

The platform says “it was a mistake” not to inform streamers and Amouranth’s ads have since been reinstated to her channel.

Elsewhere Twitch has announced its new policy that will ban users for misconduct even if it happens off the platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJpcHBsZXNuaWdlcmlhLmNvbS9rYWZmeS1uYXJyYXRlcy1ob3ctZmFjZWJvb2staGVscGVkLWhlci1yZXVuaXRlLXdpdGgtaGVyLXNpc3Rlci1hZnRlci0yMi15ZWFycy_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yaXBwbGVzbmlnZXJpYS5jb20va2FmZnktbmFycmF0ZXMtaG93LWZhY2Vib29rLWhlbHBlZC1oZXItcmV1bml0ZS13aXRoLWhlci1zaXN0ZXItYWZ0ZXItMjIteWVhcnMvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kaffy narrates how Facebook helped her reunite with her sister after 22 years,"Renowned Nigerian media personality and choreographer Kaffy real name Kafayat Shafau-Ameh has narrated how the social media platform Facebook helped to reunite her with her sister after 22 years.

During a joint meeting of Assembly and Senate judiciary committees on Saturday lawmakers spent a rainy Carson City morning digging into the details of SB452 — an emergency bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) and introduced last week that revives jettisoned portions of the other major gun bill of the session. Senators opted to vote the bill out of committee after the hearing on a 4-3 party-line vote.

Cannizzaro who presented the bill alongside Sen. Fabian Doñate (D-Las Vegas) Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) and MGM Resorts representative Ayesha Molino characterized the bill as another step that lawmakers could take to protect workers on the Las Vegas Strip.

“We are again looking to adapt our state's legal tools to better protect our hospitality workers and our visitors and guests that traveled to Las Vegas from around the world this time by ensuring that we can appropriately prevent instances where physical violence may otherwise be a factor” Cannizzaro said.

This isn’t the first time that lawmakers have heard details on the concept of expanding “gun-free zones” — similar language was initially included in Jauregui’s AB286 legislation that also bans firearm assembly kits without serial numbers and so-called “ghost guns.” The concept is strongly supported by MGM Resorts which helped present both the Assembly and Senate bills and has sought enhanced limits on firearms since the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting that took place on the company’s properties.

That bill saw amendments narrowing and finally eliminating the language on limiting firearm possession on private property — in part over concerns from progressive lawmakers and criminal justice reform advocates that the provisions would lead to more harassment and targeting of minority communities.

Despite another amendment presented Saturday the bill drew many of the same complaints and concerns from not just gun rights advocates but police unions trial attorneys progressive groups public defenders and even several Democratic lawmakers who said they feared the bill would lead to targeting of minority communities.

“We are going to have situations where Black folks and brown folks are going to be the ones who are going to be not asked to leave but who are going to be the ones that the police are called on” said Assemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong (D-Las Vegas). “I'm very concerned about that because I have a commitment to my community that I do everything that I can to try and keep them safe. We know that every single time there is an interaction with police for Black and brown people the opportunity for it to go sideways is great.”

SB452 (plus an amendment) allows for non-restricted gaming license holders (defined as more than 15 slot machines on property) to opt in to the provisions of the bill which generally prohibits individuals from bringing firearms onto casino property with certain exemptions. Businesses would be required to post signage at every public entrance and give law enforcement a seven-day notice before opting in to the bill’s provisions.

A person who is carrying a concealed firearm would have to be given a verbal warning prior to any involvement by law enforcement with no verbal warning given to someone openly carrying a firearm before the person with a gun is opened up to criminal liability or a police response. If a person refuses to leave the premises or surrender the firearm the bill would set an initial misdemeanor penalty.

Exemptions in the bill would cover security guards or police while on duty owners of residential units within the casino property guests who purchase a firearm at a trade show or anyone who obtains the written consent of the property to bring a firearm there. The amendment to the bill would require any casino property that opts in to the bill to adopt policies and procedures that include training for security guards on de-escalation techniques cultural diversity competency and implicit bias.

After the hearing the bill was processed with another amendment that sought to address concerns raised by opponents including:

Requiring an establishment’s firearm policies be provided on their website and for all signs to cite the controlling portion of state law

Require police that arrive in response to a call from the establishment to identify themselves and provide the person an opportunity to comply with the policy

Narrow the definition of “premises” to exclude any adjacent properties owned by the licensee

Revise the law enforcement exemption to mirror language in existing law on a similar exemption in the state prohibition on firearms on school campuses

Supporters stressed that private businesses already have the right to prohibit firearms on their premises but that the bill would give them an ability to better enforce their property rights — Cannizzaro said it’s “something that they may already do and we are trying to make sure that that is something that they can properly enforce.”

“This language simply enhances the business community's toolkit to notify patrons of this prohibition and to call upon law enforcement to assist and address situations before they escalate and become dangerous” she said.

The bill attracted support from Everytown for Gun Safety and the Culinary union — lobbyist Jim Sullivan cited the 2017 mass shooting and said thousands of union members “saw firsthand the effects of gun violence” and wanted to ensure that “no hospitality worker ever has to experience that trauma again.”

But much of the testimony on the bill was in opposition — ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah noted that the legislation drew opponents from across the ideological spectrum and called the bill “half-baked at best.”

“This simply isn't a bad bill that has good intentions this is a deadly bill with good intentions” he said. “No amendment to this bill no matter how well intended can fix its potential outcomes. This bill is inherently unredeemable and is a pretense for dangerous and racist stop-and-frisk policies that have plagued our country and our state.”

National Rifle Association lobbyist Dan Reid said the bill would create “a lot of uncertainty” for gun owners saying the exemption for residential unit owners in casino resorts may not cover family members or guests.

“We think this bill is wholly unnecessary and it really could implicate a lot of good people” he said.

Though Republican lawmakers and gun rights advocates vigorously opposed the bill the measure could run into difficulty in the Assembly where many Democratic lawmakers expressed hesitancy and skepticism over the bill. Assemblywoman Cecelia González (D-Las Vegas) questioned whether the implicit bias training requirements in the legislation would be the same across the board at different properties and said the circumstances described by proponents in which the bill would apply appeared uncommon at best.

“Just to be clear we are seeking to address an issue that may or may not happen” she said. “We don’t know.”

Still supporters stressed that the bill would largely mirror prohibitions on firearm possession at schools and libraries and said that lawmakers should take similar steps to ensure the safety of the state’s main economic driver — the Las Vegas Strip.

“As we've all noticed the tourism economy is the lifeblood of our Nevada economy and so we should be paying special attention to the resorts and the casinos and the hotels and all of the places that people come from all over the world to ensure that they can be safe while they are there” Senate Judiciary Chair Melanie Scheible (D-Las Vegas) said shortly before the committee vote. “And we should be able to allow those facilities to have this increased and improved amount of safety on their properties.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbXluZXdzNC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jYXNpbm8tZ3VuLWJhbi1lbmZvcmNlbWVudC1iaWxsLWRpdmlkZXMtbmV2YWRhLWRlbW9jcmF0c9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vbXluZXdzNC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY2FzaW5vLWd1bi1iYW4tZW5mb3JjZW1lbnQtYmlsbC1kaXZpZGVzLW5ldmFkYS1kZW1vY3JhdHM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casino gun ban enforcement bill divides Nevada Democrats,"An attempt to crack down on firearms in resorts and casinos is dividing Democrats in the Nevada statehouse pitting gun violence prevention advocates against activists concerned about heavy-handed policing and racial profiling.

A state Senate committee passed a measure Saturday to strengthen penalties and make it up to a felony to bring guns into certain resorts and casinos where they are prohibited.

Under current law if resort security confronts an armed person to tell them that firearms are not permitted on the premises and that person refuses to leave they can call local law enforcement on them for trespassing. The policy would allow resort security to call law enforcement on visitors openly carrying in firearm-free zones to report trespassing without having to give them a verbal warning.

Visitors suspected of carrying a concealed firearm would have to be given a verbal warning. Provisions would only apply to large resorts and casinos that choose to opt-in and would require they post clear signs about where guns aren’t allowed both on their premises and on their websites.

Sen. Melanie Scheible a Las Vegas Democrat said it made sense to enforce firearms bans in large casinos similar to how they are enforced in schools and public libraries given their importance to Nevada and its economy.

“We should be paying special attention to the resorts the casinos the hotels and all of the places that people come from all over the world to see and ensure that they can be safe while they are there. We should be able to allow facilities to have this increased and improved amount of safety on their properties” she said.

Three-and-a-half years after Las Vegas experienced the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history casinos and unions representing their workers argue that law enforcement officers — rather than resort security — are better equipped to be the first to respond to visitors carrying guns where they are not allowed.

The Oct. 1 2017 massacre killed 58 people. Last year a court approved an $800 million settlement from MGM Resorts International and its insurers to victims and their relatives.

“At the point at which we become aware that an individual is violating policy we should be able to engage with Metro; we should be able to engage with law enforcement in order to give assistance to remove that person from the property” MGM Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Ayesha Molino told lawmakers.

Molino said that calling law enforcement on visitors openly carrying firearms would be one among many tactics that resorts could use to maintain a safe environment and likely not be used in every instance allowed under the bill. That provoked resistance from gun rights and police reform advocates worried about the rules being applied unevenly and conflicts escalating after police are called.

Republicans and Democrats opposed to the bill said enforcing trespassing provisions without warning people they are violating the law could harm law-abiding citizens particularly people of color.

“I am very concerned about what I believe this leads to which is ‘Stop and Frisk’ ” Las Vegas Assemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong said. “We are going to have situations where Black folks and brown folks are going to be the ones who are going to be — not asked to leave — but are going to be the ones that the police are called on.”

Scheible said officers would still be required to follow laws prohibiting excessive searches and seizures. “This has not changed the amount of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that an officer has to have in order to stop somebody.” she said.

Gun-related legislation routinely divides lawmakers along party lines and draws fiery support and opposition in Carson City. On Saturday powerful interest groups including MGM Resorts and the Culinary Union Local 226 testified in favor of the proposal. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department representatives testified as neutral to the proposal.

But an atypical coalition of interest groups testified against the gun proposal considered Saturday. Groups that push police reform — the ACLU of Nevada and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada — found themselves on the same side as gun rights groups like the NRA and police unions which said the proposal could create unnecessary and dangerous confrontations between people and law enforcement.

The measure now heads to the state Assembly where it faces a steeper climb. A similar proposal was amended out of a bill introduced earlier in the legislative session after the chamber’s Democratic leaders couldn’t whip enough to support it. The Legislature is scheduled to adjourn May 31.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L21pY2hlbGxlLXdpZS13ZXN0LXdpdGhkcmF3cy1mcm9tLWxwZ2EtbWF0Y2gtcGxhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michelle Wie West withdraws from LPGA Match Play,By doing so Wie West will have an additional week to prepare for the U.S. Women's Open at The Olympic Club in her adopted hometown of San Francisco.

Most of the money wagered on the NFL Draft is from sharp bettors who historically have beaten sportsbooks on the event.

ESPN “Daily Wager” host Doug Kezirian said he partnered with a pro bettor on April’s draft and it paid off in a big way. Kezirian won almost $300000 on a prop bet.

He made multiple wagers totaling $3500 to win $297800 on Tyson Campbell to be the first safety taken in the NFL draft on an index prop at BetMGM.

The former KTNV-13 sports director said he made the bets the Monday night before the draft on self-serve kiosks at the Bellagio where Campbell opened at 100-1.

The pro bettor who wants to remain anonymous had tipped off Kezirian that Campbell’s draft stock was rising. His draft position over-under opened at 60½ and closed at 46½ at Circa.

Kezirian said he was looking to bet the under on Campbell when he noticed that the Georgia cornerback was listed as a safety on the BetMGM prop while every other book listed him as a corner.

“I had to do a double take” he said. “There are always a few different subtleties between books. MGM had two guys on their corner index that were listed as safeties at Circa. I just thought at 100-1 it was a worthwhile play.”

So he drove straight to the Bellagio intent on pounding the prop.

“We all have different strengths as bettors and mine are instincts. I can tell when it’s a situation to just bet as much as you can” he said. “Because these things don’t stay up there that long. One bet on a random draft index it’s going to move.”

Kezirian said he knew the kiosks wouldn’t accept wagers that pay out more than $25000 so he made a series of $200 bets that paid $20000 each.

“I just bet it multiple times and spread it out over the span of like 90 minutes” he said. “I bet a bunch at 100-1 and then the odds started to move. When they moved it to 50-1 I stopped.

“When I came home it was 25-1 and by morning Campbell was removed from the index.”

MGM Resorts director of trading Jeff Stoneback confirmed the bets were made on Campbell.

Trevon Moehrig closed as the -450 favorite to be the first safety taken in the draft and his draft position closed at 28½ after opening at 24½. Over ½ safeties in the first round was a -200 favorite as well but none was selected as Kezirian sweated out each pick.

The next day the Jacksonville Jaguars had the first pick of the second round and Campbell was a -400 favorite at Boyd Gaming to be their selection. Kezirian said he hedged his bets through side wagers with pro bettors.

When the Jaguars took Campbell Kezirian had hit the biggest sports betting jackpot of his life.

Three picks later the Miami Dolphins drafted Oregon safety Jevon Holland. The Raiders took Moehrig at No. 43 after selecting Alabama offensive tackle Alex Leatherwood in the first round.

“It was just a perfect storm of the safety position not being a high priority to teams and the Raiders being the Raiders and drafting a third-round tackle in the first round” Kezirian said. “The whole thing was a whirlwind. Moehrig dropping was key.”

When Kezirian went to the Bellagio the next day to cash his tickets he said he was initially told the wager was not a winner. But after some initial confusion over Campbell’s position he was paid in full.

“They were all professional and could not have been cooler about it” he said.

According to BetMGM house rules players are assigned to one playing position predraft by the book and once a position assignment has been made it is final.

BetMGM vice president of trading Jason Scott declined to comment for the story.

It was the second time in less than a year that the self-serve kiosks at the Bellagio were jammed overnight with winning wagers of more than a quarter-million dollars.

On June 28 approximately 50 wagers were placed on Korean and Chinese baseball games after they had started. The bets were allowed to be placed because incorrect start times were posted on the games because of a manual entry error according to an ESPN report at the time.

The Nevada Gaming Control Board ruled in favor of BetMGM in a dispute with bettors voiding more than $200000 in outstanding past-posted parlays.

Developments announced this week by a pair of Chittenden County businesses have strengthened the case for the region’s future as a hub of innovation — particularly in wireless technology and electric aircraft.

Beta Technologies a South Burlington-based electric aviation start-up secured $368 million in private capital this week bringing the company’s valuation up to $1.4 billion. The company also announced plans to build a production facility for electric aircraft at Burlington International Airport.

GlobalFoundries a New York-based microchip manufacturer and one of Vermont’s largest private employers announced it will partner with Raytheon Technologies to develop and commercialize a special semiconductor component or microchip for the next generation of wireless infrastructure. GlobalFoundries will manufacture the chips at its plant in Essex Junction.

Cathy Davis president of the Lake Champlain Chamber of Commerce said both companies are poised to bolster the region’s growing tech sector and secure more high-paying jobs.

“It’s innovation and manufacturing” Davis said. “The amount of talent and innovation that’s happening at both of those companies in regard to the work they’re doing I think is incredibly important.”

The latest funding round for Beta Technologies comes on the heels of a deal with United Parcel Service in April to produce at least 10 aircraft — and potentially 150 more — for the shipping and logistics giant by 2024. Kyle Clark founder and CEO of Beta said the company is looking to add about 300 employees to an existing 230-person staff to meet production goals.

Beta’s Alia aircraft is entirely electric and has a half-plane half-helicopter design that enables vertical takeoffs and landings.

The Department of Defense is interested in the potential of the technology for military applications. In early May Alia became the first manned electric aircraft to receive airworthiness authorization by the U.S. Air Force for test flights through Agility Prime a public-private funding program with the Department of Defense.

The company was founded in 2017 and successfully partnered with United Therapeutics a biotechnology company to develop a prototype for transplant organs and tissues. The prototype led to a $48 million deal with United Therapeutics and Beta signed a “similarly sized contract” with the U.S. Air Force Clark said.

Chris Carrigan vice president of business development at the Vermont Chamber of Commerce said Beta’s work signals a “paradigm shift” in logistics and travel.

“It’s going to transform the way that we deliver goods and services and how we travel regionally” Carrigan said.

Carrigan who also manages the Vermont Aerospace and Aviation Association said ground-up aircraft manufacturing has historically concentrated on just three main hubs worldwide: Seattle home to Boeing; Montreal home to a cluster of aerospace companies; and Toulouse France home to aerospace giant Airbus.

Beta’s approach to building the aircraft from scratch “is really the first time it’s been done in New England” Carrigan said.

Beta is well positioned to scale up while staying local Carrigan said. Under Vermont law materials for the maintenance and repair of aircraft are exempt from the state’s aviation sales tax which keeps costs down in the long term.

In addition to the manufacturing facility the company recently completed a 14000-square-foot expansion of a hangar at Burlington International. Clark also expects to expand the facility that makes Beta’s charging stations located in Williston.

The partnership between GlobalFoundries which employs more than 2000 people at its Essex Junction plant and Raytheon an aerospace and defense company headquartered in Waltham Mass. also bodes well.

Raytheon’s proprietary “gallium nitride on silicon technology” will be licensed to GlobalFoundries as part of the agreement.

For years the industry trend was to drive down the size of microchips — but 5G wireless technology requires larger chips made with gallium nitride that can withstand more heat and tolerate higher voltage levels.

GlobalFoundries already makes larger chips which gives the company a competitive advantage.

The partnership has the support of Sen. Patrick Leahy D-Vt. who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. Leahy is a long-time backer of the GlobalFoundries plant in Essex and its predecessor company IBM which at one point employed as many 8000 people.

“With announcements like this one I see the potential for the future of American-made 5G and 6G running through Vermont” Leahy said in a statement to VTDigger.

The GlobalFoundries-Raytheon partnership is a testament to “how federal investments like in research and development can have profound economic benefits for Americans too” Leahy said.

A bill on the Senate floor this week would direct about $50 billion in emergency spending to stimulate development in the microchip industry including GlobalFoundries.

Leahy’s office confirmed that the senator also helped acquire an extra $25 million for the Agility Prime program from which Beta now benefits.

GlobalFoundries will invest $1.4 billion to ramp up production of larger-sized chips at three more plants worldwide in order to address a nationwide microchip shortage.

Carrigan said the GlobalFoundries-Raytheon partnership is a welcome addition to the state’s $3 billion manufacturing economy.

“Any strategic investment in the Vermont plant is a good thing” Carrigan said.

Lindsay Kurrle secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development said cutting-edge developments at GlobalFoundries and Beta could have draw workers to Vermont.

Though there has been some discussion and dissection of this train of thinking in the rarefied echelons of strategic policy deliberations the issue has never really travelled into wider setting of public dialogues. It has something to do with semiconductors or the ubiquitous chip that powers our daily existence.

A chip or microchip is a semiconductor wafer usually manufactured from silicon that combines an assortment of electronic circuits incorporating resistors transistors capacitors and diodes that interlock to perform a required task. A single integrated circuit can comprise of thousands to millions of such electronic circuits contingent upon the computing power required.

Semiconductors rule the world today. Optimising and producing speedier thinner and more formidable semiconductors will be seminal in defining the outcome of numerous economic and geopolitical conflicts of our times. As it has been prophesized by Steve Bank the mentor of the Lean Start up movement “to get hold of the semiconductors may be the 21st century equivalent of getting hold of the oil supply in the 20th century”. This is the strategic resource that all emerging and great powers of the world are in a race to both secure and control.

The omnipotent and captivatingly nomenclatured Silicon Shield is what safeguards Taiwan. The Taiwan Semi Conductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the world’s largest third party chip manufacturer. It exercises dominance to the extent of 55 per cent if not more over the global market share insofar it pertains to the production of microchips. These semiconductors do not just power cellphones and laptops they are central to the functioning of virtually everything from automobiles to weapon systems.

The factum that TSMC produces the microchips that run the electronics of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II stealth multirole combat aircraft the latest jewel of the US Air Force is a sterling example of the extent of strategic importance of the both the resource and its supply chain. Were the semiconductor industry of Taiwan to collapse it would not only constitute a national security threat to the US but also for the entire hub and spoke security architecture crafted by the United States globally. That is how the Silicon Shield of Taiwan is in itself a weapon of deterrence for Taiwan especially against an ever expansionist China in the 21st century.

Both the US and China are trying to be autonomous when it comes to manufacturing of semiconductor chips. If the US were for some reason be deprived of access to the foundries of Taiwan the US defence and consumer electronics industries would be set back at least half a decade if not more.

As China is investing heavily in setting up its own chip foundries it could become the world leader in this technology in the next decade or so. That’s why one of the early decisions made by the Biden administration was an executive order promulgated in early 2021 to address both chip shortage and the gaps in its supply chain to the US. This deficiency is critical for the US as its global share in chip manufacturing stands at just 12 per cent. A large part of the US government’s sanctions against Huawei are singularly focussed on inhibiting the company’s access to the world’s most modern chip manufacturing technology — Taiwan’s TSMC.

China had the foresight that its initial success as the world’s low-cost factory was going to run its course and other countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh to name a few would soon occupy that space. As a result China needed to build more advanced and sophisticated products to be on par with the United States. However most of these products required custom chips — and China lacks the domestic manufacturing capability to produce them.

China uses 61 per cent of the world’s chips in products for both its domestic and export markets importing around $310 billion worth in 2018 alone. China was quick enough to appreciate that its incapacity to fabricate these sophisticated chips could well turn out to be the proverbial chink in its armour.

Beijing has always had mega motivations to build its own homegrown capacity. A total of 1.4 trillion dollars have been earmarked in the 2021 budget alone for the development of the semiconductor industry. By 2025 the objective being that 70 percent of chips used in China would be Made in China under the National Integrated Circuit Plan. Over 70 projects have been commenced utilising capital outlays in the past few years alone. Chinese semiconductor industry has gone from making zero to 16 per cent of the world’s chips.

But how does all of this mesh with the larger geopolitical conflicts between India and China? There is a growing realisation that the battle between the US and China to acquire leadership in semiconductor manufacturing is going to divide the world into microchip manufacturing haves and have not’s. That is where India fits into the Chinese plans. The semiconductor industry requires two key resources sand and freshwater. They are the basic raw materials. 10000 litres of fresh water is needed to manufacture one 30-cm silicon wafer.

China’s Achilles heel is this availability of fresh water. Key Chinese water systems like the Yangtze Huang Ho and Mekong rivers are full of effluents. That is how Kashmir Aksai Chin and Ladakh became crucial for China. The Taklamakan desert (located in Aksai Chin) not only provides abundant sand but huge reservoirs of fresh water from Himalayan rivers and glaciers. The Shaksgam valley alone is home to 242 glaciers that can serve as the grand reservoir of fresh water for Chinese chip manufacturing. It therefore becomes imperative to view the Sino-Indian standoff through this technological lens also.

From 2011 onwards the UPA government had made chip manufacturing a priority. In September 2013 two consortiums including IBM and ST Microelectronics had proposed building semiconductor wafer plants in India with an outlay of USD 8 billion. However the proposals died after the NDA/BJP government assumed office in 2014. Finally in the June of 2020 the government finally announced a Performance Linked Incentive for Promotion of Electronic Components and Semiconductors and Electronics Manufacturing Clusters. However as it is with the current dispensation it is always a case of too little too late.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWF2ZXJpY2suY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIxLTA1LTIzLW5ldXJhbGluay1lbG9uLW11c2tzLWJyYWluLWltcGxhbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Neuralink: Elon Musk's brain implant,"On 9 April 2021 Neuralink the neurotechnology company co-founded by Elon Musk in 2016 posted a video to YouTube showing a monkey playing the rudimentary video game Pong using its mind without a physical controller. The game itself resembles table tennis with the monkey positioning the paddles on each side just by thinking about it as the ball bounces back and forth.

But how?

The technology that made it a reality also called the Neuralink is a brain implant that makes it possible for the brain to wirelessly interface with a machine. On 29 August 2020 Musk streamed an hour-long “live demonstration” of the technology.

“It’s kind of like a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires” he told the audience. The physical device that Musk presented to the audience looks about the same size as a R2 coin. Attached to it are threads which house electrical conductors that can be implanted into the brain. To insert it a piece of the skull is cut out and replaced with the coin-size device.

According to the company’s website “The threads on the Link are so fine and flexible that they can’t be inserted by the human hand.” To insert one of these they are developing a robot “that the neurosurgeon can use to reliably and efficiently insert these threads exactly where they need to be”. However during that August 2020 presentation Musk said that eventually the whole process would be automated. “The Link procedure the installation of the Link… done in under an hour. So you can basically go in the morning and leave the hospital in the afternoon.”

The device would also come with a charger circular in shape that can be plugged to a power source to wirelessly charge the Neuralink from outside the human body.

But why?

At its most basic the device would then allow users to control a digital device such as a computer or smartphone with their minds. According to Neuralink “The Neuralink app would allow you to control your iOS device keyboard and mouse directly with the activity of your brain just by thinking about it.”

While this sci-fi future might be appealing to some in the general populace Musk told the audience that Neuralink’s goal is to create a device that can “solve important spine and brain problems with a seamlessly implanted device”.

Neuralink’s website also states that the “initial goal” of their “technology will be to help people with paralysis to regain independence through the control of computers and mobile devices. Our devices are designed to give people the ability to communicate more easily via text or speech synthesis to follow their curiosity on the web or to express their creativity through photography art or writing apps.”

Again how?

Neurons action potentials and synapses that’s how. Australia’s University of Queensland website describes neurons as “the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world for sending motor commands to our muscles and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between.”

Each of us has roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain that have synapses which are structures that make it possible for them to receive and send messages. The neurons communicate with each other via brief electrical signals known as action potentials which cause synapses to release neurotransmitters the chemical messengers that transmit a signal from a neuron across the synapse to the target cell.

Neuralink says that they place their electric conductors “near neurons in order to detect action potentials. Recording from many neurons allows us to decode the information represented by those cells. In the movement-related areas of the brain for example neurons represent intended movements. There are neurons in the brain that carry information about everything we see feel touch or think.”

Theoretically once Neuralink has the neuron’s intended message it can be sent directly to a computer or other cells.

So when should I book my implant date with Elon’s robot?

As things stand Musk is still to confirm clinical trials on humans. Brain implants are also not an entirely new science and beyond being wireless some question whether or not the Neuralink has made significant progress in the field.

A day after Musk’s August 2020 “live demonstration” Antonio Ragalado the biomedicine editor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MIT Technology Review wrote a sceptical article titled Elon Musk’s Neuralink is neuroscience theatre.

He wrote: “As yet four years after its formation Neuralink has provided no evidence that it can (or has even tried to) treat depression insomnia or a dozen other diseases that Musk mentioned in a slide. One difficulty ahead of the company is perfecting microwires that can survive the ‘corrosive’ context of a living brain for a decade.

“That problem alone could take years to solve. The primary objective of the streamed demo instead was to stir excitement recruit engineers to the company (which already employs about 100 people) and build the kind of fan base that has cheered on Musk’s other ventures and has helped propel the gravity-defying stock price of electric-car maker Tesla.

“Despite the long list of medical applications Musk presented Neuralink didn’t show it’s ready to commit to any one of them. During the event the company did not disclose plans to start a clinical trial a surprise to those who believed that would be its next logical step…. It is unclear how serious the company is about treating disease at all.”

Then there are the potential privacy issues. The Neuralink literally traffics in data directly from your brain. That in itself might present a new category of privacy concerns in terms of what data companies might have access to. In December 2019 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) a policy advisory body with 37 member countries published their first “OECD Recommendation on Responsible Innovation in Neurotechnology” driven in part by the realisation that “neurotechnology raises a range of unique ethical legal and societal questions that potential business models will have to address. These questions include issues of (brain) data privacy the prospects of human enhancement the regulation and marketing of direct-to-consumer devices the vulnerability of cognitive patterns for commercial or political manipulation and further inequalities in use and access.”

So… what now?

Musk and Co are certainly not the only ones in the neurotechnology game. The Swiss company Mindmaze is working on a variety of technologies including something called the “cognichip” a microchip “that can replicate the way that the brain handles huge amounts of data” and potentially advance the field of “digital therapeutics” in healthcare.

Then there’s Synchron which is developing the Stentrode “a minimally-invasive brain-computer interface currently being investigated in a clinical trial involving people affected by severe paralysis. Our first in-human study has thus far demonstrated that two patients with ALS were able to use the Stentrode to text email shop and bank online through direct thought improving their functional independence. This research is ongoing.”

But for now consumers looking to scratch their neurotech itch in a non-invasive way can pre-order Neurable’s Enten headphones through its fundraising indiegogo campaign. The headphones use EEG (electroencephalogram) brainwave sensors to translate “brain activity into simple actionable insights you can use in your everyday life”.

According to a YouTube video posted by Neurable on 4 May the Enten headphones translate the brain’s electrical signals and use an app which then interprets these brain signals into data you can understand such as letting you know when you are most focused and for how long you were focused. It also promises to let you track how specific activities affect your focus.



“You can even learn what music keeps you in the zone. While you listen to your playlist on your favourite music apps Enten will track which songs help you focus and offer recommendations on what to listen to when… or when you’re in the zone Enten will automatically cancel background noise and block notifications to keep you from getting distracted” says the voiceover in the video. Neurable estimates that it will start shipping in May 2022. However do keep in mind that while the earphones seem far less invasive than a brain implant the technology still gives Neurable access to data directly from your brain. DM/ML

In the latest fiscal quarter the company was overtaken by rival Micron Technology in terms of operating profit margin for the sector with the former posting 18% and the latter reaching 20%. A drop in the profitability of the company's cash cow could also affect its investment capacity in other sectors such as semiconductor contract manufacturing and displays.

The decline in the semiconductor operation's profitability in the period from January to March stems largely from a plant shutdown in Texas after cold weather caused power outages in mid-February and the opportunity loss during this period led to a drop in earnings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdHJpcGVzLmNvbS90aGVhdGVycy9hc2lhX3BhY2lmaWMvMjAyMS0wNS0yMi9BLUphcGFuZXNlLXBhcGVyLWNvbXBhbnktd2FudHMtdG8tbWFrZS1hLXdvb2Rlbi1yaXZhbC10by1jYXItYmF0dGVyaWVzLTE1NjU1MDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Japanese paper company wants to make a wooden rival to car batteries,"Toru Nozawa chief executive officer of Nippon Paper Industries Co. at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on May 17 2021. (Akio Kon/Bloomberg)

It's a potential leap in technology that most scientists remain skeptical about but which a Japanese paper producer is determined to pursue: using trees to develop a successor to lithium-ion batteries for electric cars.

Nippon Paper Industries Co. is targeting new breakthroughs in the use of cellulose nanofibers - materials produced by refining wood pulp to the size of hundredths of a micron or smaller and currently used in products like diapers or food additives - with the aim of creating supercapacitors that could store and release energy with vastly improved performance and less environmental impact than existing batteries.

""We must move faster in working with other companies to find practical uses"" Toru Nozawa Nippon Paper's chief executive officer said in an interview. Cellulose nanofiber or CNF based-supercapacitors could ""be applied for areas where lithium-ion batteries are used such as cars and smartphones.'' The firm aims to have a pilot energy storage system ready for demonstration at the World Expo in Osaka in 2025 and to fully commercialize the technology by a decade later.

Supercapacitors hold massless electrons in an electric field while batteries store energy in chemical form. The differences mean that the former are ideal for delivering short and intense bursts of power - like the pop of a camera flash - but have only a fraction of the storage capacity of a lithium-ion battery.

For decades that's meant supercapacitors have taken a role in niche applications used in memory back-up systems for laptops pitch control for wind turbine motors or in regenerative-braking for some hybrid and plug-in vehicles. They've also held out the long unrealized promise of an energy storage system with dramatically shorter recharging times fewer safety risks and zero reliance on pricey metals like cobalt or nickel.

""There are lots of opportunities for supercapacitors to continue to grow as a technology but they are in a completely different technology segment versus batteries"" said Sam Jaffe managing director at Boulder Colorado-based Cairn Energy Research Advisors an industry consultant. ""Supercapacitors are not and never will be a competitor to lithium-ion batteries.""

There's also a challenge from enhancements to existing lithium-ion batteries which have routinely provided good energy storage capacity but have previously found slow recharging a limitation. Now some battery technologies offers 30 minute charging times and companies including Volkswagen are aiming to cut that duration to about 12 minutes said BloombergNEF analyst James Frith.

Proponents of supercapacitors insist there's value in persevering. Energy density is already improving and the components can take another major step forward by using CNFs said Mikio Fukuhara a research fellow at Tohoku University who has collaborated with Nippon Paper.

In a paper published in March in the journal Nature a team of scientists including Fukuhara offered evidence that supercapacitors using CNFs could be used to store large amounts of electricity and have potential suitability for handheld electronics transportation and for the storage of renewable energy.

Early use cases would be devices using low voltages such as smartphones or smartwatches Fukuhara said by phone. Deploying the supercapacitors in electric vehicles would be the ``ultimate application'' and requires another set of advances in part because the cars use higher voltages. ""I am confident it will replace lithium-ion batteries in future and become a deciding factor in the effort to save the environment'' he said. ""It will be another industrial revolution.""

Competitors working on other projects to develop better supercapacitors are also confident. ""Once the development is complete the technology will be used in enhancing the capacity and lifespan of electric vehicles and energy storage systems"" said Yoo Seung Joon a professor at South Korea's Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology's Organic Electrochemistry and Energy Materials Laboratory.

Nippon Paper is also seeking opportunities to lift supply of materials to existing battery manufacturers while it continues to develop the rival technology. The company has added at least one leading producer as a customer and is also considering plans to establish supply hubs in growing markets like Europe Nozawa said in the Monday interview.

""There's no doubt that the shift to electric vehicles will accelerate"" he said. ""We have to tap into the flow.""",,,,,,,,,

We’ve certainly seen our share of egregious cases over the years. Microsoft however has defiantly forged its own path with industrial design across the board. Its products are largely interesting and innovative — something not every hardware manufacturer can say these days.

The company doesn’t always get it right. It swung for the fences with the Surface Duo for example. While certainly innovative the product came up short in enough categories that made it extremely hard to recommend. The Surface Laptop on the other hand while not the most groundbreaking product in the line has pretty consistently been one of the best marrying a Windows-ready touchscreen with a more standardized notebook design.

The last few models have been solid and this year’s — perhaps predictably — doesn’t present a big change. The big upgrades after about a year and a half are new chips (your choice of AMD Ryzen or an Intel Core i5 or i7) and enhanced battery life that offers a beefy additional 8.5 hours. Essentially it’s the sort of thing you’d expect — or hope for — from a regular system refresh.

The design language remains largely unchanged. The Surface Laptop is nothing if not unique on that front with its tapered sides and felt-covered palm rests. The material has a nice feel to it — one that bests just straight-up metal on a cold day though I’ve already noticed a bit of wear after some light use.

The keyboard remains on the soft side with a surprising amount of give to it. Not the best keyboard I’ve seen on a laptop but certainly not the worst (who can forget that rough run for Apple?) and like anything else it takes a bit of getting used to.

You’d think I’d have learned my lesson by now. Maybe it’s the fact that Microsoft’s Surface Laptops keep coming out when the weather is nice that I always feel inclined to take them outside. But jeez is that display reflective. Almost distractingly so. Plenty of laptop screens are glossy of course but Microsoft’s really leaned in here to the point I wouldn’t recommend using it in any sort of sunshine — even at full brightness the screen can’t counteract that reflection.

When you can see it the display looks great. Microsoft sent along the smaller of the two. At 13.5-inches the screen clocks in at 2256 x 1504 at 201 ppi (you get the same pixel density on the 15-inch version as well). Ours was the new Ice Blue color. It’s subtle though. Honestly I read it more as a silver/gray. The speakers sound great and the webcam is just fine but it’s safe to say it’s probably time to upgrade to 1080p across the board as teleconferencing remains front of mind.

The 13.5-inch system starts at $1000 which gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage along with the AMD Ryzen 5 4680U process. As configured our system runs $1700 which doubles the RAM and storage and swaps the AMD in for an Intel Core i7. Another $600 will double the RAM and storage yet again (same processor). Geekbench scored the processor at a solid 1378 on single-core and 4876 on multi-core. Performance was solid throughout — though after spending a fair amount of time using Apple’s M1 it’s clear that Intel has its work cut out for it.

Microsoft is still hanging onto its magnetic proprietary charging port here. I know it still has its diehard fans but I’d much prefer to see the company go with something more universal like adding another USB-C port — though that impacts the system’s compatibility with a slew of different Surface accessories. Around the other side you get USB-A USB-C and a headphone jack. It’s a nice mix but more ports would certainly be a step up.

I was fairly disappointed with the various corners the company cut on the Surface Laptop Go last year. Of course the entry-level 13.5-inch Laptop is $300 more than the 12-inch Laptop Go. But if you’re looking to do more than just the basics this is probably is a wise investment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGhlLW91dGVyLXdvcmxkcy1taWNyb3NvZnQtb2JzaWRpYW4tdGFrZS10d28taW50ZXJhY3RpdmUtcHVibGlzaGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Is Now Officially the Publisher of 'Future Iterations' of The Outer Worlds,"Microsoft has officially taken over publishing rights for ""future iterations"" of The Outer Worlds from Private Division and that news arrived a day after Take-Two Interactive's president said the company was fully committed to the franchise.

During Take-Two Interactive's Q4 2021 earnings call (via Seeking Alpha) CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed that The Outer Worlds has sold-in more than 3 million units since it was released in October 2019. Later in the call Take-Two president Karl Slatoff answered a question about the Obsidian Entertainment-developed game stating that the company was not only excited about the future of The Outer Worlds but was happy to be a part of it.

""And we will be participating in the franchise and whatever the future holds for that franchise"" Slatoff said. ""So we feel really good about it. And we think that it's still building audience and this game itself has a lot of life left in it. And in the future -- we'll see what the future holds for it. But we do think it's a long-term franchise and it is certainly something that we're pleased with the results.""

Take-Two's comments on being involved in The Outer Worlds' future were of note mainly due to the fact that Microsoft purchased Obsidian in 2018 and Slatoff's comments made it seem as though it would retain publishing rights for new installments despite that.

Private Division cleared up the confusion in a statement to Gamasutra saying that while the company would still be supporting 2018's The Outer Worlds Obsidian and Microsoft would handle the publishing of future iterations.

""Private Division is still supporting and marketing The Outer Worlds including the upcoming release of Murder on Eridanos DLC on Nintendo Switch"" said the company. ""Moving forward Obsidian and Microsoft will be publishing future iterations in the franchise and we're absolutely thrilled to see where they take it.""

After Google recently wrapped up its I/O 2021 event earlier this week Microsoft will soon be going live with its Build 2021 event. The event is set to go live on May 25 and will go on till May 27. In its all-online avatar the event is also free to stream live for anyone interested.

With Microsoft Build 2021 the company is expected to showcase more updates on what is going on with Windows and other consumer products from the company. Here’s what to expect from the new Build 2021 event.

The future of Windows

Windows 10 hasn’t been the most talked-about product at previous Build conferences. This is a trend that is expected to continue this year as well with the company focusing more on developer experiences like Project Reunion which was announced last year.

However rumours have also been suggesting the Microsoft has a big visual revamp of Windows planned for the second half of the year. While Microsoft’s Windows 10X was killed as a standalone product its features and visual designs could be something we will still see in a new Windows implementation.

As Microsoft explained in a blog post technologies from Windows 10X can be integrated into other parts of Windows and other Microsoft products so that the new stuff is not just “confined to a particular subset of customers.”

New changes include a modernised touch keyboard optimised key sizing sounds colours and animations. These are expected to come to the 1.3 Billion devices across the world that are already running Windows 10. New changes are also expected in the Microsoft Store

Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge the company’s Internet Explorer successor that is based on the Chromium engine has been steadily updated throughout last year adding new features like Vertical Tabs a Performance Mode and a Kids Mode.

Microsoft is expected to reveal more about its future plans for the browser at the new Build 2021 event. At the Ignite conference the company even mentioned its plans to merge the codebase between the mobile and desktop versions of Edge which would allow easier updates and cross-porting of features.

Microsoft 365 and Teams

With conferencing tools like Microsoft teams going big since the Covid-19 pandemic affected most parts of the world discussion on its future plans including new features is expected to be another big part of the event. Teams and Microsoft 365 received many updates including a Bookings app and the new Lists app during the Build 2020 event last year.

A report by Digital Trends suggests that Microsoft has lined up over 287 sessions focusing on Teams Azure and Power Platform all of which fall under the Microsoft 365 banner of products. More sessions could also be added later."

Chandigarh (Punjab) [India] May 23 (ANI): As the country is battling the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic Covid vaccine manufacturer Moderna has refused to send vaccines directly to the Punjab government stating that according to their policy they only deal with Government of India and not with any state government or private parties informed the State Nodal Officer for vaccination Vikas Garg.

In a statement issued today Garg said that all vaccine manufacturers were approached for direct purchase of various Covid vaccines including Sputnik V Pfizer Modern and Johnson and Johnson as per the directions of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh to explore possibilities of floating a global tender for the procurement of vaccines from all possible sources to ensure early inoculation in the state.

Divulging further the Nodal Officer said that reply was received from Moderna only in which the company refused to deal with State Government.

It may be recalled that the state government was forced to stop vaccination for Phase one and Phase two categories in the last three days because of non-availability said Garg adding that all efforts would be made for procurement of vaccines to meet the acute shortage in the state which had received fewer than 44 lakh vaccine doses so far from the Government of India (GOI).

As per the GoI allocation for Phase III (18-44 age group) the state government has been been able to buy only 4.2lakh vaccine doses including 66000 received yesterday. A total of 3.65 Lakh have already been used leavingonly 64000 for use as of now said Garg.

Shoulder injuries related to vaccine administration (otherwise known as “SIRVA'') is a rare but possible occurrence when you get a vaccine. SIRVA happens when a vaccine is injected into the capsule of your shoulder joint instead of your deltoid muscle. It can also occur if the needle being used is not the correct length for you or if it’s administered too high or too deeply into your muscle. SIRVA is essentially a shoulder injury that occurs due to an improperly administered vaccine - not from the vaccine itself.

Now it should be noted that this condition is very rare. However due to the sheer volume of vaccines being administered right now - we have seen a slight uptick in unresolved shoulder problems here in our office. Anywhere from weeks to months after vaccination. For most the shoulder pain is very mild and it goes away on its own. But for a select few their shoulder pain has persisted and manifested into a more severe problem. This could be a sign you have SIRVA. Since the signs and symptoms don’t show up right away I thought it would be helpful to go over with you what is considered “normal” vs not normal shoulder pain after you get a vaccine.

You’ve likely heard of the “Moderna arm” by now. This is a mild skin irritation specifically related to the Moderna vaccine that typically involves a mild rash and skin sensitivity after your second shot. It usually lasts about 3-5 days and can be easily treated with topical anti-inflammatories. Moderna arm is not considered to be anything serious and although it’s not normal to experience this after most traditional vaccines it is considered a common reaction to the Moderna vaccine. If you’ve recently had your second Moderna shot and are experiencing what you think could be Moderna arm speak with your doctor or dermatologist if symptoms continue to persist past five days just to make sure there isn’t something else going on.

Localized shoulder pain at the site of your vaccine injection is also normal. We see this with any type of injection or vaccine into your arm not just with COVID vaccines. The pain you feel is from the mild trauma caused by the needle being inserted into the soft tissue (muscle) of your arm. It often feels like a bruise and you may experience a little bit of swelling. It will typically go away after 2-3 days. Even though your arm can be quite sore the important distinction here is that you’ll still have full normal function of your arm. In other words despite the soreness you can still move your arm freely up and down if you had to without restriction. Your arm soreness will go away with time but gently massaging the area of pain and even some easy movement or exercise can help the soreness go away a little faster.

The symptoms of SIRVA are different and typically more severe than what I’ve just described above. If not addressed some of these symptoms could lead to long lasting shoulder problems. As I alluded to above one of the main distinctions between “normal” shoulder pain after vaccination and SIRVA is how well your arm functions. If the needle was accidentally inserted into your joint capsule for example you will notice limited mobility and possibly limited strength. If unaddressed symptoms like this can manifest into more serious shoulder problems down the line such as adhesive capsulitis or frozen shoulder. If the needle was inserted too high or too deeply you can end up with shoulder bursitis which means the needle was inserted beyond your muscular layer and directly into the bursa (a cushiony fluid-filled sack) causing it to become inflamed. Your mobility may or may not be impacted when this happens but what you’ll notice is that your shoulder pain will take a lot longer than two or three days to subside. Bursitis is actually a really simple injury to treat but where I see most things go wrong is that you can end up with compensatory problems in places like your neck shoulder blade or elbow the longer it is allowed to persist. The last thing you might see from an improperly injected needle is rotator cuff tendonitis. What you’ll notice with this is that you’ll likely have full mobility in your shoulder but it will be very painful and weak to exert force in your arm. Much like bursitis this is not a complicated injury to rehabilitate but if not rehabilitated properly it leads to other problems that do become more difficult to treat down the line.

OK so to summarize your shoulder will hurt after getting a vaccine. And with the Moderna vaccine in particular you may notice some skin sensitivity mild swelling and even a rash. But these symptoms should go away and not remain. If you have shoulder pain that persists and especially if you’re noticing limited mobility it’s something worth getting checked out.

The last thing you want is for these symptoms to go on longer than needed or turn into compensatory long lasting problems. The good news is that even with SIRVA these problems and symptoms can be successfully treated naturally and without medications or procedures.

Thomas Nides a former official in the US State Department who currently is a managing director at Morgan Stanley is likely to be chosen as the US ambassador to Israel according to multiple news reports.

In addition to serving as deputy secretary of state for management and resources under former President Barack Obama Nides has connections to several high-ranking officials in the Biden administration. He also would bring private-sector experience to the job.

US President Joe Biden is expected to name his envoy to Israel in the coming weeks. The nomination and confirmation process could take several more weeks after that however. In the meantime the State Department reportedly will send Michael Ratney a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs and consul general in Jerusalem during the Obama administration in an interim capacity.

Nides is no stranger to Washington. He was chief of staff for the majority whip of the US House of Representatives Tony Coelho D-Calif. from 1986 to 1989 and then chief of staff for House Speaker Thomas Foley until 1993. He also was chief of staff for US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. He served as campaign manager for Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman in 2000.

President Barack Obama nominated Nides to his deputy secretary of state position which he held for two years. He has had a long-time relationship with Obama as well as Biden. Nides raised at least $100000 for Biden’s presidential campaign according to Politico. He reportedly was slated to become White House chief of staff for Hillary Clinton had she defeated Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

During his tenure in the Obama administration Nides worked as part of the team that led to the Obama administration’s approval of a $38 million 10-year loan guarantee package for Israel. He also worked to thwart an effort by some lawmakers to limit US support for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and for UNESCO.

Nides became managing director and vice chairman of Morgan Stanley in March 2013 after previously serving as its COO from 2005 to 2010.

Nides who was born in Duluth Minn. and who is Jewish is married to Virginia Carpenter Moseley CNN’s senior vice president of newsgathering in the US.

Several other names had been discussed to fill the Israel ambassador position most recently former Florida Congressman Robert Wexler who currently heads the Washington-based S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace. Biden campaign donor and Morgan Stanley executive Michael Adler and former US Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro also were reported to have been under consideration for the job.

The ambassadorship to Israel is a very high-profile job in any US administration and it has garnered even more notice in recent days due to the fighting between Hamas and Israel which ended early Friday with a bilateral cease-fire.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzIyL2hhd2FpaS1uZXdzL29uLXRoZS1tb3ZlLWdyYW50LWt1Ym90YS1iYXJyeS10b2t1aGFtYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On the Move: Grant Kubota Barry Tokuhama,"Morgan Stanley has announced that Grant Kubota a senior vice president financial adviser in the firm’s Honolulu Wealth Management office has been named to Forbes Magazine’s 2021 list of America’s Best-in-State Wealth Advisors.

Ownership of renewable energy stocks is as crowded a trade as technology stocks were at the height of the 1999 dotcom boom according to index provider MSCI.

The claim follows a flood of investment into the sector with global inflows into clean energy exchange traded funds surging to $14.7bn in the six months to the end of March according to data from Morningstar up from just $1.3bn in the same period of 2019-20.

This helped push stock prices sharply higher with the S&P Global Clean Energy index jumping 150 per cent in the year to the end of March pushing sector-wide price earnings ratios above 35.

MSCI has calculated that stocks that are crowded according to its metrics accounted for more than 8 per cent by weight of the renewable energy sector as of the end of March far more than for cyber security the next most crowded sector at under 3 per cent.

This left clean energy stocks only a fraction less crowded than small and mid-cap technology companies were immediately prior to the 2000 dotcom crash during which the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index plunged 78 per cent over the subsequent two-and-a-half years.

MSCI’s models forecast that in the event of a “severe economic headwind” such as an outbreak of stagflation the level of crowding meant the clean energy sector could fall 42 per cent compared with a 31 per cent fall for growth stocks and 20 per cent for global markets in general.

The renewable energy sector “became progressively more crowded throughout 2020 as equity markets rebounded from their lows in March of that year” said Anil Rao executive director of equity solutions research at MSCI. “The theme continued its upward trajectory through the end of the year and into the first quarter of 2021.”

Almost a dozen clean energy ETFs have launched since the start of 2020 according to data provider TrackInsight taking the total to 26 with combined assets of $22.4bn up from just $2.4bn at the end of 2019.

S&P Dow Jones Indices was forced to scramble to broaden its Global Clean Energy index last month after a torrent of money into two BlackRock ETFs that track it left them owning significant chunks of a swath of stocks.

This flood of activity has been matched by a rising tide of voices warning that flows were getting out of hand.

Patrick Pouyanné chief executive of Total one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies told the Financial Times in February that “there is a bubble” in the renewables sector. Valuations are “just crazy today” Pouyanné added a trend he attributed to a limited supply of assets of significant scale.

“I think we’re 100 per cent in a green bubble” Gordon Johnson chief executive of GLJ Research said the same month. “Pretty much every solar company I cover their numbers got worse and the stock like tripled . . . This is not normal.”

MSCI’s Rao argued that the renewable energy sector’s underperformance since March — since when the S&P clean energy index has fallen 9.3 per cent — “can be explained in part by its crowding characteristics”.

MSCI’s measure of crowdedness is constructed from five underlying metrics: valuation trading volume volatility momentum and short interest.

It said all five tended to rise as more capital is pumped into stocks with short interest building up as some investors start to bet that bubbles are forming.

The five largest renewable-themed ETFs all had exposure to crowded stocks that were either in line with the sector’s average score or were higher still MSCI said with “many of the most crowded stocks held across multiple funds”.

Ownership can be highly concentrated with for example the Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) holding 18.4 per cent of the free float of Nasdaq-listed Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives at the turn of the year according to Morningstar although this has since fallen.

Some remain upbeat about the renewables sector though.

Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar said “the massive inflows witnessed in the last half” were driven by Joe Biden’s presidential victory in the US and his subsequent programme of green investment.

As a result Lamont said “those seeking short terms gains may already be late to the party but as valuations have fallen in 2021 the long-term case for alternative energy stocks remains strong”.

Hector McNeil co-chief executive of the HANetf platform which last week unveiled the impending launch of Europe’s first pure-play solar energy ETF said “by definition we’re trying to get themes that are going to be long-term plays and that are fast growing. The way markets have come off [since March] I think it’s a good entry point. I think there is a lot of capacity still to grow.

“There is going to be a big realisation that the [emissions reduction] targets governments have set themselves are going to be pretty tough to achieve unless they act quickly.”

McNeil was also relaxed about the possibility of popular ETFs ending up owning uncomfortably large proportions of some stocks.

“We do a lot of liquidity analysis and we feel pretty confident there are enough stocks in this market and this industry to be not worrying about the concentration risk particularly with new companies coming to the sector” he said.

Lamont accepted that the energy sector had to expand rapidly in order to “meet the existential questions” society is currently facing but also drew an analogy with the dotcom crash and the tech sector’s subsequent rise to dominance.

“You can be right in the long term when it comes to renewable energy but the volatility can hurt a lot of people in the meantime” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vbW9kZWwtcG9ydGZvbGlvLWNoYW5uZWwvYW4tdXBkYXRlLXRvLWNsaWZmLWFzbmVzc3Mtc3R1ZHktb24tdGhlLWJlbmVmaXRzLW9mLWEtbGV2ZXJlZC02MDQwL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vbW9kZWwtcG9ydGZvbGlvLWNoYW5uZWwvYW4tdXBkYXRlLXRvLWNsaWZmLWFzbmVzc3Mtc3R1ZHktb24tdGhlLWJlbmVmaXRzLW9mLWEtbGV2ZXJlZC02MDQwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Update to Cliff Asness’s Study on the Benefits of a Levered 60/40,"Upon launching the WisdomTree U.S. Efficient Core Fund (NTSX) previously referred to as the WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund we updated some of the seminal research from Cliff Asness on the diversification benefits that come from applying leverage to a traditional 60/40 portfolio approach. Today we are excited to launch international and emerging markets versions of these strategies with the WisdomTree International Efficient Core Fund (NTSI) and the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Efficient Core Fund (NTSE). While this piece focuses on U.S. markets our research has shown similar results outside of the U.S.

Additionally while there is a new mantra that academic studies fail to replicate after researchers publish their findings what was interesting was that in the 25 years after Asness published his paper the results actually improved!

We now have another three years since the launch of the WisdomTree U.S. Efficient Core Fund to test out how this strategy works in real time—in addition to the research and historical hypotheticals.

In Asness’s 1996 piece titled “Why Not 100% Equities: A diversified portfolio provides more expected return per unit of risk” one of his core arguments was that an “investor willing to bear the risk of 100% equities can do even better with a diversified portfolio.”

Asness showed how the use of leverage which we discuss below when applied to a traditional 60/40 strategy could achieve a similar volatility as the 100% equity exposure but could help improve the return.

Asness’s paper based on data from 1926 through 1993 applied a 155% leverage rate to a 60/40 portfolio (applied monthly) where the borrowing rate used for leveraging his 60/40 portfolio was done at a cost of financing by the one-month t-bill rate. This is a table from his paper:

Figure 1: Return and Volatility Table from Asness’s “Why Not 100% Equities” Paper

The Asness Research vs. the WisdomTree Efficient Core Approach

While aspects of the two are similar there are of course some very important differences between the approach of the WisdomTree U.S. Efficient Core Fund and its targeted exposures and the research that Asness published.

The similarities between the two strategies come from the equity exposures. The large-cap “equity beta” exposure in NTSX targets S&P 500-like returns and as such overlaps what we see in Asness’s piece. However there are more distinct differences on the bond exposure side of the equation.

Asness showed returns for bonds using the long-term corporate series from Ibbotson funding these bond returns by borrowing at the one-month t-bill rate so an investor could earn both credit and duration premiums over the t-bill rate.

Bond Futures vs. Corporates

WisdomTree is implementing bond exposure in the WisdomTree U.S. Efficient Core Fund through laddered Treasury bond futures. No one earns “credit risk” premiums through this Treasury bond futures exposure so there is less additional income to be earned from that perspective.

Although there are very important differences between our strategy implementation and the Asness study we think that study is very useful in understanding the market dynamics at work in a levered 60/40 approach.

In a previous blog post we showed an update of the Asness research in the 24 years after his first publication.

Now we update that to extend through 2020 and show how NTSX has compared to his simulations.

Our calculations use the same Ibbotson data series and methodology: borrowing -55% at the one-month t-bill rate that finances the 155% exposure every month in the 60/40 mix of S&P 500 and the Ibbotson corporate bond series. Our independent calculation of Asness’s test showed the same compound return figures.

Figure 2: WisdomTree’s Replication of Asness’s Results (1/31/1926–12/31/1993)

For definitions of terms in the chart please visit our glossary.

When we updated the figures for the next 27-plus years we saw that stocks returned generally in line but we also saw lowering equity volatility. While the compounded S&P 500 returns ticked up 10 basis points (bps) from 10.3% to 10.4% when updated through 2021 the bonds’ compounded returns ticked 160 bps higher from 5.6% to 7.2% so a 60/40 portfolio increased by 20 basis points from 8.9% to 9.1%.

Because cash rates generally also ticked down over the 27-year period after Asness published the paper the levered 60/40 returns using Asness’s assumptions/calculations ticked up 200 basis points from 11.1% to 13.1% when updated to 2021 and the spread between 100% equities and the levered 60/40 widened out from 80 bps at the time of his original study to 130 bps over the full 1926–2021 period. When people publish research often the research itself gets a reputation of “failing to replicate out of sample.”

Asness’s study and the levered 60/40 portfolio utilizing the same approach he outlined in the paper actually saw portfolio returns outperform in the following 27-year period compared to its historical back test. The levered 60/40 portfolio returned 13.1% for the 1994–2021 period 270 bps ahead of the 100% equity line compared with only 80 bps during his original test.

WisdomTree’s Live Fund out of Sample Results

While replicating Asness’s research has been instructive as to the potential for this strategy how did NTSX fare in real time?

In short NTSX outperformed 100% stocks by 1.61% per year with lower volatility and drawdowns. While it lagged the hypothetical levered 60/40 by nearly 3% per year this was primarily a function of much longer duration for their fixed income position and credit over-weights versus NTSX.

During periods of rising rates we would expect NTSX to add value compared to the levered 60/40 hypothetical approach quoted in the Asness study. Additionally we believe that Treasuries may be a better diversifier than corporate credit in helping to dampen equity volatility.

Current Equity vs. Bond Debates

Right now one of the core asset allocation conundrums remains: Interest rates generally are still near their lowest levels and as such one doesn’t earn as much from bonds as in the past. Similarly equity valuations are extended from historical levels so forward-looking equity returns are also lower than normal.

The conundrum for traditional asset allocators however is that equity premiums (how much compensation stocks are offering over relatively “safe” assets like bonds) are likely still favoring stocks in asset allocation models.

Professor Jeremy Siegel under whom I have studied extensively believes the current equity premium over bonds is more than 5% whereas his work over the last 200 years shows the real equity premium was closer to 3% historically.

Shifting bond exposures to equities which have higher volatilities when they are at high valuations is not easy to do. Substituting some of the traditional equities with a package of equities that also increases bond exposure could perhaps help solve one of these key asset allocation debates facing investors: stocks or bonds? Why not both for the same dollar invested?

But investors shouldn't conflate holding cryptocurrency with holding a stock. The two asset classes are very different and behave very differently.

The differences between cryptocurrency and stocks are actually a good thing. It'll make your portfolio truly diversified. But it's important to understand what you're buying and how it might affect your portfolio's risk profile and returns.

What is a stock?

A stock represents equity in a company. When you buy a share of Apple stock for example you're essentially buying a tiny fraction of the company's operations and assets.

You are an owner of the company. You don't have control over the operations but you get to vote on key aspects of the company like who sits on the board of directors and how much executives get paid. You're entitled to a portion of the assets of the company. And anytime someone buys a new iPhone or Mac you technically earn a few fractions of a penny.

A corporation will sell stock and give up some control of the company in order to raise funds to grow the business. Early employees may receive shares of the company as compensation instead of cash because start-ups may be devoting all of their cash to growing the business. A company may make a public stock offering to raise more funds or list its stock directly on an exchange to allow early investors to sell some of their shares and cash out.

What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a term used for various digital currencies that rely on blockchain technology to provide a secure payment network and eliminate double-spending. Instead of relying on a central bank cryptocurrencies use a network of computers to confirm transactions.

A cryptocurrency is issued directly by the blockchain it uses. For example the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) blockchain will issue a certain number of coins for the network node that confirms the next block in the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are also used to pay the fees to process transactions on the blockchain.

Similarly Ether (CRYPTO: ETH) is the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum blockchain. But many crypto tokens use the Ethereum blockchain to run decentralized finance applications. A project like Uniswap (CRYPTO: UNI) uses the Ethereum blockchain to run its exchange which means Uniswap users need to use Ether to perform transactions. So buying Ether is a bet that the Ethereum blockchain will continue to expand in functionality as more decentralized applications gain adoption.

You could also buy tokens directly. Tokens for DeFi projects like Uniswap may be utility tokens or governance tokens.

Utility tokens like Binance Coin (CRYPTO: BNB) enable people to use a decentralized finance app. Binance for example uses Binance Coin to pay for transaction fees on its exchange. Users can also use Binance Coin to buy new tokens launched on its platform. Users can hold the token to get better rewards for using its debit card. And they have to use Binance Coin to pay for games and applications that run on the Binance blockchain.

Governance tokens are similar to utility tokens but add the ability to vote on the future of a blockchain project. (Uniswap is a governance token.)

Owning a utility token like Binance Coin imparts zero ownership interest of the underlying company. So when Binance earned about $750 million in profits in the first quarter of 2021 that all went to the owners. (There are mechanisms allowing owners to share profits with token holders but that's at their discretion.) Governance tokens and many corporate stocks both offer voting rights but that's about where the similarities end.

The most important factor for diversification

Understanding what you're buying when you buy shares of a stock or a few cryptocurrency coins or tokens is important. If you're buying cryptocurrency to diversify your portfolio you need to know if the investments behave similarly.

Historically Bitcoin and the S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) have practically no correlation. That means the direction of their value changes aren't related. That's good for diversification but negative correlation -- where one asset appreciates in value while the other declines in value -- is usually better for managing risk.

It's also important to note cryptocurrencies are historically much more volatile than stocks. So when they go up in price they go way up and when they go down they go way down. And since there's no correlation between cryptocurrency prices and stock prices that means adding cryptocurrency to your portfolio alongside stocks will increase the risk profile of your portfolio.

Owning cryptocurrency is definitively not the same as owning stock. The crypto asset class may be attractive to investors looking to take on additional risk in exchange for greater potential returns. But crypto investors should understand what they're buying and the role it plays in their portfolio.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Companies With The Most Cash Reserves In America.

The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the economy in a way that no one thought possible. Back when the economy of the United States crashed in 2008 - 2009 and the rest of the world followed suit few people thought they would face an even worse disaster in 202o just over a decade later. But that is what happened in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic which originated in China spread across the world leading to over 170 million cases as well more than 3.5 million deaths. These figures themselves are likely to be extremely understated and we will know the true impact of Covid-19 in the coming years.

As countries started imposing lockdowns to battle this virus for which they had no solution economies which are entirely dependent on lockdowns well not happening. Most industries faced significant losses as economies collapsed and most countries across the globe entered into either recessions or depressions. Many companies had to incur massive losses as well as major layoffs as demand for most industries fell and going at the same rate as pre-pandemic made no sense at all.

Even though as I mentioned most industries and companies suffered some actually came out of the pandemic smelling like roses. Take Tesla for example. The market cap of the company jumped astronomically during 2020 making even ordinary shareholders into millionaires and making Elon Musk the richest man in the world and the highest earning billionaire in 2020 as well as the richest man in the world for a while. Tech companies generally managed quite well in fact with many companies reporting higher sales and profits as demand for tech increased while more and more people continued to work from home.

Another example is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America. Apple Inc has nearly $200 billion in cash and marketable securities. One would think that with a large number of its stores closed Apple would have suffered dearly during the crisis. Fortunately for Apple Inc. (AAPL) shareholders the company did well during the past 12 months and AAPL shares performed even better. The company used some of its cash hoard to continue paying dividends and buy back shares. Apple Inc. should have used its massive cash hoard to snatch some EV and battery companies on the cheap.

15 companies with the most cash reserves in America

Another technology stock that is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America is Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook Inc carries more than $60 billion in cash on its books and despite this huge buffer Facebook shares declined all the way down to $140 in March 2020. Mr. Market misjudged Facebook's potential for a few days but investors had a change of heart after a few weeks and Facebook shares returned more than 120% since its March 2020 lows. Unfortunately Facebook Inc's management didn't put its huge cash hoard into good use and take advantage of the opportunities.

Most of the companies that made our list of the 15 companies with the highest cash reserves in America are tech companies but you can also find non-technology stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Ford (NYSE:F) on our list. Costco was one of the beneficiaries of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic but JP Morgan Chase and Ford shares suffered large losses despite their cash reserves.

It would make sense that tech companies have massive cash reserves. Due to the high value of shares of these companies as well as the fact that their products are generally highly priced with significant margins these companies tend to have a lot of surplus cash on hand. However having a lot of excess cash can also be often considered to be a failure on the part of the company to have the cash simply lying around when it could be put to better use say on investing activities or to pay off debts which would allow the company to save significant money on interest payments. On the other hand having too little cash can give the signal that the company has liquidity issues and can also be perceived negatively by investors and shareholders. Therefore there is a fine balance to maintain one which many companies are able to maintain while others are not.

However in the era of Covid where the economy needs significant boosts it is frustrating many people including Wall Street that companies are sitting on massive piles of cash and yet are refusing to utilize it. As I mentioned earlier companies can use it for investing activities as well as acquisitions or by returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends which would gain them goodwill in an unprecedented year. Another option is buyback of shares from shareholders though detractors argue that this is simply a short term boost for investors while resulting in a long term effect on the health of a company.

Of course the simple reason would be that this isn't the best time really to spend money. The market is uncertain the economy will take a while to recover and while there is optimism on the horizon with vaccines being administered it is still a long haul process and not an immediate one. Hence companies are a bit cautious in investing money. Further the biggest companies in the world are also really big on acquisitions with Apple acquiring a hundred companies over the last 6 months. That means an acquisition every three to four weeks. Furthermore tech companies famous for having a lot of cash on hand are also known for sitting on said cash. And even though this doesn't mean that these companies are not spending cash at all it's just that many analysts believe that these companies are not doing as much as they do.

Coming up with the list of companies with the largest cash reserves in America was not an easy task. Search on the internet and you'll generally find tech companies and even then those articles are often outdated. Most people want to know the reserves that companies have now one year after the Covid-19 pandemic rather than back in 2019 or 2018. Hence we selected the biggest companies from the Fortune Global 500 list and focused particularly on the tech industry as it is true that these companies tend to have the most cash. We have selected the latest quarterly reports for each company and scoured the balance sheet to find out the cash reserves that these companies own. Due to the high liquidity of marketable securities we have considered them among cash equivalents as well though most other types of investments including long term investments have not been considered. Together these companies hold more than $1.1 trillion in cash alone which is truly an astonishing amount. So without further ado let's take a look at the companies which combined have more cash than most countries in the world starting with number 15:

Based on his own experiences as a gay man with cerebral palsy “getting the show made has been a fucking journey” as he told Variety in 2019. “This might shock you but putting a gay disabled lead on TV isn’t an instant sell. It takes time perseverance and a sprinkle of delusion.” Complicating matters was the fact that the show O’Connell wanted to make wouldn’t be the “inspiration porn” that has otherwise defined television’s scant representation of people with disabilities. His gay lead would be funny and kind sure. But he’d also be a little selfish self-centered at inconvenient times and have hot complicated explicit sex.

Perhaps in a bid to sell the show to skeptical buyers O’Connell gave the first season a hook beyond his character’s description. In the first episode the Ryan of the show gets (lightly) hit by a car on his way to a new job where he decides to not correct everyone when they assume the accident caused his limp. Ryan spends most of the season terrified that people will find out the truth but eventually ends up “coming out of the disabled closet” to everyone else’s confusion and his own relief. The secret gives the season a drive and framework but it also keeps the show from being able to fully be what it wants to be: a hangout show starring a gay man with a disability living his life as a gay man with a disability.

Freed of the higher concept that defined the first season the second season of “Special” is exactly that show and all the better for it.

Popular on Variety

For as many thousands of TV shows are there seem to be these days selling a TV show is still and always a game of connections luck and a buzzy enough hook to keep a room of suits interested. If you can’t sum up a show in a single smart sentence — bonus points if it ends with a twist — then it probably doesn’t stand a chance of making it all the way to the screen. Sometimes a show will have such a solid idea of where it’s going that it never has to deviate too far from its initial path. More often though shows start shedding the premise that once defined them so they can settle into their own developing voices. This holds especially true for comedies which can live and die by the elusive magic of cast chemistry. It was frustrating to watch and enjoy the first season of “Special” and realize that it only barely had enough time to untangle its own premise because by the end of it its characters were more than smart and defined enough to carry the show on their own.

Season 2 of “Special” which premiered May 20 on Netflix is also the final season of “Special.” This having now seen it is a real shame. Given the chance to flesh this new batch of 8 episodes out from 15 minute episodes into a full-fledged half-hour comedy O’Connell and his new writers’ room found a groove that suits them — not least because getting to expand upon these stories in a second season allowed them to get past the all-consuming premise that defined the first.

Ryan dates around with experiences running the gamut from a truly degrading sexual experience to his first real love (Max Jenkins). At some point he also realizes that he’s never truly had friends with disabilities who can intrinsically understand his experience without him having to explain it; when he stumbles upon a vibrant funny group that welcomes him with open arms it comes as a bittersweet relief. The season also gets to expand beyond Ryan with his mother Karen (the excellent Jessica Hecht) understanding her own life beyond her longstanding role as Ryan’s caretaker and his best friend Kim (Punam Patel) figuring out what she actually wants. (Shoutout to Netflix’s in-house dream boy Charlie Barnett recurring here as a tech bro with a heart of gold for making Kim’s decisions all the more difficult.) O’Connell Patel and Hecht were very good in the first season but given the chance to explore them in more depth they all do excellent work in the second season that shows how important it can be for a show to have enough time to develop beyond its initial growing pains.

Watching this season move beyond the “coming out” storyline also makes it clear how much value there is in following characters beyond their coming out stories. Coming out is of course a huge moment for anyone; each story has its own complex shape and arc. But for many there’s a whole other life to explore that has nothing to do with accepting themselves for who they are. There’s love and joy heartbreak and pain fun and laughter that all just has to do with living a life. Giving a character such as Ryan the chance to evolve beyond his own version of “coming out” means giving him a chance to live a life onscreen in a way he couldn’t before. While it’s sad to realize this season is his last it’s a pleasure to watch unfold.

Someone could be snooping on your Netflix watch history right now.

Or perhaps there's an old-friend-turned-nemesis out there binge watching TV shows from your Netflix account. You know the one you spend your hard-earned money on?

If you've ever shared your Netflix account with someone it's possible that they still have access and you don't even know it. Even if you don't mind them using it because you're the generous type this could still pose problems for you.

On Netflix's standard $13.99 plan for example a maximum of two screens can be used to watch content at the same time. If you've got more than two people trying to watch on their TV or mobile device then someone is going to be blocked from watching — and that would really suck if that was you the person paying for the account.

So in order to protect yourself and your ability to watch whatever you want whenever you want here's how to check and see who has got access to your Netflix account:

Figure out who is using your Netflix account

From here you can easily tell if someone other than you is using your account. For example is there a type of device that does not match the one you use to watch Netflix? Does one of the locations or IP addresses not match your home or anywhere that you watch Netflix? Then obviously that's someone else who's logging into your account!

Obviously if there are devices or locations you don't recognize accessing your account you want to remove them. But even if you know who else has access to your account and are fine with that now there may come a time where you're not.

How to stop people from using your Netflix account

Now that you've determined who has been watching Netflix using your login here's how to boot everyone off of your account:

Go to the ""Account"" page under your profile once again.

Inside Burnham's first comedy special in almost five years will arrive on Netflix Sunday May 30. The comedian-slash-actor-slash-director announced the release date via Instagram on Friday after first teasing the special last month.

""Hi. I made a new special. It was filmed by me alone without a crew or an audience over the course of the past year"" Burnham wrote in the earlier post.

The Promising Young Woman star stepped away from stand-up comedy for various personal reasons after his 2016 Netflix special Make Happy. Burnham told The Washington Post in 2018 that he struggled with anxiety during the tour for the special sometimes having panic attacks on stage. ""It's an incredibly surreal place to have one within the confines of something you made in front of 3000 people that have no idea that paid to come see you"" Burnham said. ""It's funny in hindsight.""

Close friend Ray Hadley confirmed the news on 2GB 873 radio on Sunday afternoon.

“It’s a very sad day for the Fulton family and rugby league generally” an emotional Hadley said on radio.

“I’ve announced some sad things on radio but this could be the saddest... I’m going to miss him he was a great man... the most loyal friend I’ve ever had. He’ll be sadly missed.

“He was surrounded by his wife Anne and children and dear friends when he went.

“He was first diagnosed some time ago and those close to him knew of it. Some time during the latter part of last year he was given weeks to live. He fought and fought and fought. One of the things he promised he would do was come to my wedding on the 27th of March even though he was not in the best of health.

“I received a message from him four days ago that things were not looking so good and that he would be in contact with me shortly. That never occurred because he passed away this morning in hospital.

“It is a devastating loss for his family for his wife Anne. He had a lifelong love affair for Anne. For his three children his grandchildren and those of us who loved him.

“My association with him goes back 40 years. In 1987 we started on the Continuous Call Team and we retired together in 2019.

“It is a very sad day for the Fulton family. He was the first of those Immortals and I always thought he would be Immortal.”

Fox League’s Paul Kent was close with Fulton and revealed on Triple M the events in recent weeks that had led to his passing.

“Devastating to be honest” he said.

“He had been crook for some time with cancer. Obviously kept it to himself. I spoke to him he was on the rebound he had some new treatment that had bought him more time but then the last week he went downhill quite quickly and was in a lot of pain and the past three days he has been unconscious.”

Fox League’s James Hooper paid tribute to the legendary player and coach declaring “there would be no Manly Sea Eagles” without him.

“He was the Australian coach an Immortal of the game there wasn’t anything Bozo didn’t achieve in terms of his rugby league career and will be celebrated as one of the most influential people to have played and also coached the game” he said.

“There would be no Manly Sea Eagles as strong as they are today without Bob Fulton.”

Gorden Tallis also took the time to reflect on Fulton’s career and the impact he had on his understanding of rugby league.

“His DNA is in the game” he said.

“I remember he was the Australian coach and I just came into the game I played with his son Scott Fulton at lower levels. He was just one of those names every kid had heard of him he was as big as Wally Lewis.

“He was one of the original Immortals. I remember working with Frank Stanton he was one of those tough old coaches and he said: ‘Bob Fulton was the greatest player he ever coached because of his work ethic’. He was the fittest player in his time. It’s a sad day for rugby league.”

Hannah Hollis and the panel paid tribute to Fulton on Fox League.

“The rugby league community is well and truly in mourning today after rugby league Immortal and Manly legend Bob Fulton has died after a long battle with cancer” Hollis said on Fox League.

“He passed away this morning surrounded by close friends and family. He was 73 years of age.

“He coached more than 400 games. He played 263 games. He is Hall of Famer No.74 and he was a member of the Team of the Century in 2008.

“He won three grand finals and he captained one of them. He will live on in the hearts and minds of rugby league fans right around the country and the world.”

Panthers legend Greg Alexander paid tribute to one of the first four Immortals.

“Bozo was a Manly legend and an Immortal so he was one of the best that has ever pulled on a pair of boots” Alexander said.

“When I grew up as a young teenager and even before that when I started watching footy Bozo was at the peak of his powers in the mid-70s winning competitions.

“He was a part of that great era of the late 70s for the Sea Eagles.

“As a player some said he was the best ball-runner that they have ever seen. He was a freak of a player there is no doubt about that.

“I was fortunate that I have had a lot to do with Bozo over the years. Whether it is being coached by him. He was the coach of our 89 tour that toured New Zealand for three weeks. He was the Kangaroos coach in 1990.

“Bozo was a great representative coach because he knew it. He knew just exactly how to treat the players. He gave them a bit of a leash but as long as they turned up and put the work in.

“You couldn’t have asked for a better representative coach because Bozo knew exactly what made it work.

“I was fortunate when I retired to go and work for the continuous call team for a couple of years with Ray Hadlee and Bob Fulton and they were great years for someone like me a former footballer working in the media.

“They were fantastic to me and Bozo was a terrific man. It is shocking news. It is a big shock.”

Further to his obvious on-field talents Alexander fondly recalled Fulton the man.

“Bozo had a great sense of humour” Alexander said.

“I can imagine Bozo being one of those players that there was always a prank in Bozo and he was always involved in the funny side of things.

“He could be serious too but he was just a genuine bloke.”

Alexander also revealed the close relationship between Fulton and current Manly coach Des Hasler.

“He had a great relationship with Des” Alexander said.

“This will knock Des for six because they were tight. Des was a player under Bozo and Bozo got him in as a coach. Bozo had a lot to do with him through Des’ early years as a coach.

“I think it will galvanise the Sea Eagles. Bozo right up until last year still had a lot to do with the club. He was an influential bloke.”

NRL Commission Chairman Peter V’landys said: “We have lost a giant of the game a great promoter of the game and he will forever be part of rugby league’s DNA. The game is so much richer for the contributions of Bozo.”

Manly legend Mark Spudd Carroll paid tribute to the man that lured him to the Sea Eagles.

“Firstly condolences to the Fulton family” Carroll said.

“A massive loss for the game. He was the best player to ever play for Manly.

“Without Bob Fulton I wouldn’t have won a comp and I wouldn’t have played for Australia and he was like my second dad.

“When I heard the news I went cold. It is very emotional.

“1990 we went on the Kangaroos tour and what a tour that was. I was an Emu I didn’t play any Test footy but Bozo made it so fun representing Australia.

“I then had the opportunity to be coached by him on a weekly basis. He taught me so much about rugby league.

“But he made it fun. We trained hard and we played hard and Bozo is going to be highly missed.

“Bob Fulton your father talks about him as a young bloke. I remember he rung home and dad said it is Bob Fulton on the phone. I swore and said you have got to be kidding me.

“He said son I want to get you to Manly. I sat down and said Bozo I’m sick of losing and I want to win a comp and he said I want you at Manly and I did that.

“We had three cracks at it and we won one. Bozo taught me how to play rugby league and in the front row. He taught me about toughness. He taught me how to train.

Close friend Ray Hadley confirmed the news on 2GB 873 radio on Sunday afternoon.

“It’s a very sad day for the Fulton family and rugby league generally” an emotional Hadley said on radio.

“I’ve announced some sad things on radio but this could be the saddest... I’m going to miss him he was a great man... the most loyal friend I’ve ever had. He’ll be sadly missed.

“He was surrounded by his wife Anne and children and dear friends when he went.

“He was first diagnosed some time ago and those close to him knew of it. Some time during the latter part of last year he was given weeks to live. He fought and fought and fought. One of the things he promised he would do was come to my wedding on the 27th of March even though he was not in the best of health.

“I received a message from him four days ago that things were not looking so good and that he would be in contact with me shortly. That never occurred because he passed away this morning in hospital.

“It is a devastating loss for his family for his wife Anne. He had a lifelong love affair for Anne. For his three children his grandchildren and those of us who loved him.

“My association with him goes back 40 years. In 1987 we started on the Continuous Call Team and we retired together in 2019.

“It is a very sad day for the Fulton family. He was the first of those Immortals and I always thought he would be Immortal.”

Fox League’s Paul Kent was close with Fulton and revealed on Triple M the events in recent weeks that had led to his passing.

“Devastating to be honest” he said.

“He had been crook for some time with cancer. Obviously kept it to himself. I spoke to him he was on the rebound he had some new treatment that had bought him more time but then the last week he went downhill quite quickly and was in a lot of pain and the past three days he has been unconscious.”

Fox League’s James Hooper paid tribute to the legendary player and coach declaring “there would be no Manly Sea Eagles” without him.

“He was the Australian coach an Immortal of the game there wasn’t anything Bozo didn’t achieve in terms of his rugby league career and will be celebrated as one of the most influential people to have played and also coached the game” he said.

“There would be no Manly Sea Eagles as strong as they are today without Bob Fulton.”

Gorden Tallis also took the time to reflect on Fulton’s career and the impact he had on his understanding of rugby league.

“His DNA is in the game” he said.

“I remember he was the Australian coach and I just came into the game I played with his son Scott Fulton at lower levels. He was just one of those names every kid had heard of him he was as big as Wally Lewis.

“He was one of the original Immortals. I remember working with Frank Stanton he was one of those tough old coaches and he said: ‘Bob Fulton was the greatest player he ever coached because of his work ethic’. He was the fittest player in his time. It’s a sad day for rugby league.”

Hannah Hollis and the panel paid tribute to Fulton on Fox League.

“The rugby league community is well and truly in mourning today after rugby league Immortal and Manly legend Bob Fulton has died after a long battle with cancer” Hollis said on Fox League.

“He passed away this morning surrounded by close friends and family. He was 73 years of age.

“He coached more than 400 games. He played 263 games. He is Hall of Famer No.74 and he was a member of the Team of the Century in 2008.

“He won three grand finals and he captained one of them. He will live on in the hearts and minds of rugby league fans right around the country and the world.”

Panthers legend Greg Alexander paid tribute to one of the first four Immortals.

“Bozo was a Manly legend and an Immortal so he was one of the best that has ever pulled on a pair of boots” Alexander said.

“When I grew up as a young teenager and even before that when I started watching footy Bozo was at the peak of his powers in the mid-70s winning competitions.

“He was a part of that great era of the late 70s for the Sea Eagles.

“As a player some said he was the best ball-runner that they have ever seen. He was a freak of a player there is no doubt about that.

“I was fortunate that I have had a lot to do with Bozo over the years. Whether it is being coached by him. He was the coach of our 89 tour that toured New Zealand for three weeks. He was the Kangaroos coach in 1990.

“Bozo was a great representative coach because he knew it. He knew just exactly how to treat the players. He gave them a bit of a leash but as long as they turned up and put the work in.

“You couldn’t have asked for a better representative coach because Bozo knew exactly what made it work.

“I was fortunate when I retired to go and work for the continuous call team for a couple of years with Ray Hadlee and Bob Fulton and they were great years for someone like me a former footballer working in the media.

“They were fantastic to me and Bozo was a terrific man. It is shocking news. It is a big shock.”

Further to his obvious on-field talents Alexander fondly recalled Fulton the man.

“Bozo had a great sense of humour” Alexander said.

“I can imagine Bozo being one of those players that there was always a prank in Bozo and he was always involved in the funny side of things.

“He could be serious too but he was just a genuine bloke.”

Alexander also revealed the close relationship between Fulton and current Manly coach Des Hasler.

“He had a great relationship with Des” Alexander said.

“This will knock Des for six because they were tight. Des was a player under Bozo and Bozo got him in as a coach. Bozo had a lot to do with him through Des’ early years as a coach.

“I think it will galvanise the Sea Eagles. Bozo right up until last year still had a lot to do with the club. He was an influential bloke.”

NRL Commission Chairman Peter V’landys said: “We have lost a giant of the game a great promoter of the game and he will forever be part of rugby league’s DNA. The game is so much richer for the contributions of Bozo.”

Manly legend Mark Spudd Carroll paid tribute to the man that lured him to the Sea Eagles.

“Firstly condolences to the Fulton family” Carroll said.

“A massive loss for the game. He was the best player to ever play for Manly.

“Without Bob Fulton I wouldn’t have won a comp and I wouldn’t have played for Australia and he was like my second dad.

“When I heard the news I went cold. It is very emotional.

“1990 we went on the Kangaroos tour and what a tour that was. I was an Emu I didn’t play any Test footy but Bozo made it so fun representing Australia.

“I then had the opportunity to be coached by him on a weekly basis. He taught me so much about rugby league.

“But he made it fun. We trained hard and we played hard and Bozo is going to be highly missed.

“Bob Fulton your father talks about him as a young bloke. I remember he rung home and dad said it is Bob Fulton on the phone. I swore and said you have got to be kidding me.

“He said son I want to get you to Manly. I sat down and said Bozo I’m sick of losing and I want to win a comp and he said I want you at Manly and I did that.

“We had three cracks at it and we won one. Bozo taught me how to play rugby league and in the front row. He taught me about toughness. He taught me how to train.

“He was everything to me and he turned me into Mark Carroll and who I was as a footballer.”

Tributes poured in from around the rugby league community for Fulton after news came through of his sad passing."

Some seem to think so.

The latter whose market cap was briefly overtaken by renewables company NextEra Energy Inc. in October has since rallied with the price of crude and is now worth nearly 80% more.

This post is in partnership with Nike. All opinions are my own.

I’m a big sneaker fan. I have quite the collection of Nike sneakers and they are my favorite. However there are so many options so I’m excited to share why the Nike Air Max 270s are my go-to sneakers! Summer is around the corner and if you’re looking for the perfect sneaker whether you’re wearing a cute dress or heading to the gym for a quick workout these are it! I love how comfortable they are. They fit true to size and I appreciate how the tongue is attached and doesn’t move around. They come in tons of colorways but the fresh white with the gold swoosh got me. These are actually my second pair of this style!

GREAT FOR WALKING

This is an extremely popular shoe recently and I really appreciate how it’s more of a lifestyle shoe. I love the lightweight feel and the woven fabric makes these extremely breathable. These do give you a bit of a lift as far as height but the sole is so comfortable. One of my favorite features besides the standout heel is the pull tab to make these easy to put on or take off. I wore these while walking all over Savannah and Charleston and didn’t have any issues! They are perfect for exploring and any of your summer activities.

These come in tons of colorways so there is something for everyone. Shop some of the colorways below.

STYLE WITH ALMOST ANYTHING

Another reason why the Nike Air Max 270s are my go-to sneakers is you can wear them with almost anything and they look fantastic. I went for more of a sporty look here with a white club skirt and cropped tank. Together this outfit is cute and casual enough for going to a nice brunch or exploring a new city on your summer travels. I also style these sneakers with dresses for a more laid-back look.

SUPPORTIVE FOR WORKOUTS

While these are more of a lifestyle shoe you can wear these sneakers to the gym and they are supportive and reactive enough for a great workout. While they are a little higher up I haven’t had any issues with my ankles rolling. I don’t run but I love these for the elliptical weights and high-intensity training. I can do any BBG workout in these and know it’ll be a good workout.

I will note when I workout in these I will pull the laces a little tigheter to give my ankle ample support. When I’m wearing these in a more lifestyle setting I tuck my laces in so you can’t see them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vY2hpZWZzd2lyZS51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yMi9rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnMtdHJhdmlzLWtlbGNlLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5ldy1uaWtlLXNuZWFrZXItY29sbGVjdGlvbi04Ny1hbmQtcnVubmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chiefs TE Travis Kelce launches new Nike sneaker collection,"Kansas City Chiefs TE Travis Kelce is taking his signature sense of style to Nike collaborating with the brand to launch a new sneaker collection.

What We’re Saying: Nike SB is celebrating its longstanding partnership with Paul Rodriguez by issuing a special colorway of the Dunk Low. Courtesy of on-foot images shared by @yankeekicks — and more recently official product photos — we see the ever-popular silhouette has been given the Swoosh's famed ""What The"" treatment blending design elements from Rodriguez's extensive sneaker line with the brand.

In familiar ""What The"" fashion the Dunk Low ""What The Paul"" showcases a mismatched scheme incorporating details from some of the skateboarder's signature Nike silhouettes and subsequent collaborations. The P-Rod 1 “Mexican Blanket” is referenced on one of the shoes for example while the other is a nod to the P-Rod 1 “Stash.” The Dunks also include elephant print accents that point to the Air Jordan 1-inspired P-Rod 1 “J-Rod.”

He was the first chief executive of the Charlotte Area Transit System from 1999 to 2007.

He led the construction of the original Lynx Blue Line from Interstate 485 to uptown.

And he created a long-range transit plan which includes the Blue Line extension (which opened in 2018); the Gold Line streetcar (under construction); and the commuter rail line to Lake Norman (stalled for more than a decade due to an impasse with Norfolk-Southern railroad).

Ron Tober was the first chief executive of the Charlotte Area Transit System from 1999 to 2007.

Tober talked at the SouthPark Starbucks last week as the Colonial Pipeline crisis was unfolding and the Charlotte City Council was preparing to vote on the Future Charlotte 2040 Comprehensive Plan.

He talked about his frustrations with Charlotte Moves — an $8 billion to $12 billion transportation plan that would be funded with an increase in the Mecklenburg County sales tax of one penny. He also talked about his disappointment about the alignment of the planned Silver Line light-rail project from Matthews to Belmont.

He also said that the pandemic has been so disruptive to traditional work patterns that the city of Charlotte may need to wait longer than a year to see how many people return to work in-person before spending billions on trains and buses.

Some answers have been edited for brevity:

Q: The transportation plan has a little bit of everything: Light rail. Buses. Sidewalks. Greenways. Is that good — or would you prefer to see a more focused plan that concentrates on a few things like the Silver Line?

It’s too scattershot — there’s no definition. We learned a lot of lessons with the Blue Line. You need cost estimates and getting cost estimates into people’s heads. They are talking $8-12 billion — but there’s not enough meat behind that number. And there are a lot of people concerned about the Silver Line alignment missing the heart of downtown missing the airport. They should take some time to revisit the Silver Line and be more specific about what they want voters to approve.

(The Silver Line is planned to run along Interstate 277 on the north end of uptown. Tober supported the idea of building a tunnel through the heart of uptown but CATS said that was too expensive.)

Q. The airport — you want it to turn to the south and get close to the terminal right? (Under the current plan the station would be on Wilkinson Boulevard and passengers would then ride a bus or people mover to the terminal.)

Get closer to the terminal yes. There is a way to do it. The airport resisting it has nothing to do with TSA and security. It’s parking revenue. They need the revenue.

Charlotte Douglas is so close to downtown. A lot of people aren’t going to use it to get there. It will be predominantly for workers. But for the people who want to travel — to make them take a people mover and travel a mile — there’s not a lot of specificity on that. And there are a lot of people in the business community who aren’t crazy about that.

Q. Atlanta and D.C. have their trains running close to the terminal. I’ve heard people say it’s not safe because of the flight paths and that doesn’t make a lot of sense.

It’s not in the flight paths. You can get a station in behind or in front of the daily parking decks. That’s within several hundred feet — not a mile.

Q. And what about the uptown alignment? You wanted a tunnel through the heart of uptown but the Silver Line is going along I-277 north of uptown.

I don’t think it will get much ridership particularly with the pandemic and the telecommuting. There were concerns about the risks of tunneling. But we never did detailed engineering studies about what’s underneath how it would function. It’s short-sighted not to go through downtown so you aren’t serving both the northern half and southern half.

Q. Speaking of telecommuting is it reasonable to say “Let’s hold off on the transit plan because we don’t know what uptown will look like in terms of how many people are working there”?

I think it makes a lot of sense. It’s not my preference but frankly I would be hard-pressed to argue against that. We need to see. Is a year enough time to see how those commuting patterns settle out? Is a year from now enough time to see how much red is on the freeway (on apps like Google Maps)? I really think there will be more telecommuting from this thing than before.

Q. Do you worry about the plan being too vague and having something for everyone — buses greenways sidewalks and so forth? The arts tax was like that and it failed. The arena vote that failed 20 years ago was like that too — something for everyone.

One of the things that concerns me is we don’t know much about the plans for the bus system. You think about how many CATS had in 2007 — we have almost exactly the same number of buses today. We are now over 1 million population. In terms of upward mobility the question is how much emphasis is on light rail and how much is on bus improvements?

Q. With buses it seems there are two big problems. One is the future of telecommuting. The other is that before the pandemic CATS had lost one-third of its bus riders in a short amount of time. You can make argument that we need more buses. The other argument is that buses have already been creamed by ride-share. Can they recover?

People talk about Uber and Lyft as taking people off of public transportation. I don’t see that. And from what I read that’s not a major contributor (to transit ridership declines). The biggest thing is quality of the service. People that have choice in terms of how they travel can telecommute much easier. People who ride buses don’t have the opportunity to telecommute. They have to be there on the job.

Q. Some say that in a good economy more people can buy their own car and they don’t need the bus. Does that play into it?

Sure it does. Particularly about the quality of service and how people can complete their trips. I’m not denying that. But CATS has had some success in some routes where they have made changes.

Q. With the Red Line when the northern towns said they were opposed to the plan because the Red Line was never built (planning director) Taiwo Jaiyeoba said this year “now it’s a high priority.” Did that convince anyone?

I assume it didn’t. I won’t cuss here while I’m being recorded. It’s as if (an attempt to build the Red Line) wasn’t done in the past. The reality is there is a business case for Norfolk Southern to do this.

Q. Going back in the past was it a failure of the city to negotiate the deal with Norfolk-Southern for an intermodal yard at the airport and not secure the rights to the freight line to build the Red Line?

I couldn’t agree more. I tried to talk to (former aviation director) Jerry Orr and he didn’t want anything to do with me. I tried to talk to the mayor and the city manager’s office and I couldn’t get anything done. They wanted that intermodal terminal at the airport.

Q. Let’s assume there is no breakthrough on the northern line. Is the best strategy to be honest and just say “It doesn’t look like we can do this?”

Yeah. And the rhetoric of giving additional priority to this is … B.S. OK. I’m sorry Taiwo it’s B.S. It’s as if we haven’t done that.

Q. Why has Taiwo taken the lead on the mobility plan instead of CATS chief executive John Lewis?

Good question. … (Lewis) needs to. And he hasn’t.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuYWwuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYmlybWluZ2hhbS9uYW1lL2JvYi1tYWhhZmZleS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMDA2MDcwN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bob Mahaffey Obituary (2021) - Birmingham AL - AL.com (Birmingham),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.al.com/us/obituaries/birmingham/name/bob-mahaffey-obituary?id=10060707 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuYWwuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYmlybWluZ2hhbS9uYW1lL2JvYi1tYWhhZmZleS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMDA2MDcwN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvc2ltb25lLWJpbGVzLWJlY29tZXMtZmlyc3Qtd29tYW4tdG8tbGFuZC15dXJjaGVua28tZG91YmxlLXBpa2UtaW4tY29tcGV0aXRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZV9jNjQ0ZWVhYi05M2RkLTU4MjYtOWIzYy0xMTFhOGJlYzYzN2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simone Biles becomes first woman to land Yurchenko double pike in competition,"Memphis TN (38111)

Most PGA Tour pros travel with their standard 14 clubs and bring a few backups in case something happens. For instance nearly everyone brings a backup driver and a backup putter. Some players swap out 2-irons and 5-woods based on the course conditions too but Mickelson takes things to another level. He often travels with between 23 and 25 clubs including multiple woods irons wedges and putters.

It was his sixth major championship and with it comes a five-year PGA Tour exemption which essentially ends his Champions Tour career. He now becomes an even more iconic and historical player. It also brings him into the conversation for the 2021 Ryder Cup.

Question For Phil Mickelson

Q. We’ve watched you transform your body over the years. You have talked this week about transforming your mind in terms of focus. You already have a Hall-of-Fame career. What is it in you that continues to chase greatness and execute the way that you just did today?

PHIL MICKELSON: I just love this game of golf and I love what I do and I love the challenge of competing against such great players. I mean what an incredible competitor and tough player Brooks Koepka is and to have a chance to play in the final group with him was an exceptional honor.

It’s been really fun for me to see his development. I remember playing a practice round with him in 2013 at Oak Hill PGA Championship first time we ever played together and seeing the way his game has developed and what a tough player he is. It was a really difficult task for me to go head-to-head and come out on top and I’m appreciative of the opportunity.

More to come…

Since 2019 nearly 2km of path repairs have been completed with work now being carried out on the last 200m to the summit of Slieve Donard.

The work is being carried out with locally sourced stone 200 tons of which has been flown by the National Trust helicopter from old quarries within the Mournes.

Two new National Trust rangers James Fisher and Theo Burke are involved in the intensive work.

Mr Burke said the main aim of the footpath is to protect the fragile habitat from erosion as well as to provide a sustainable walking surface for the 100000-plus visitors to Slieve Donard each year.

Just weeks ago the mountains were damaged in a major blaze which took more than 100 firefighters several days to extinguish.

It was also the biggest gorse fire ever recorded in Northern Ireland and affected 200 hectares of National Trust land around Slieve Donard Millstone Mountain and Thomas Mountain.

Aerial and ecological surveys are still being carried out to obtain a full picture of the scale of the damage and inform a restoration plan.

Mr Fisher said the original path was installed 25 years ago but over time it has started to erode.

“We bring up stone by helicopter from the quarries on the other side of the mountains and fit that into the existing path so we have the stone going in and shoring the side up” he said.

“We have funding for the project from the Department of Agriculture and the Environment which is to last 10 months that came on the back of previous funding.

“Personally I have worked on this project for coming up to two years I was with the Mourne Heritage Trust.”

The process of building the path involves digging out original stones and rebuilding it using the new stone fitting it together and packing it in and sealing it.

“It’s all hand tools the same tools that were used up here 100 years ago” he said.

Mr Burke urged all visitors to stick to the paths and protect the habitat.

The pandemic has seen an uplift in the number of visitors to the mountains.

Previously there were around 100000 visitors a year but it is estimated to have risen by 60 per cent.

Mr Fisher said: “A lot more people have discovered the Mournes and are making use of it which is great to see.

“The one thing is that a lot of those people don’t have the familiarity with the mountains so really the message is to be properly prepared for the quick-changing conditions have the right clothes with you and proper shoes.

“But also to be aware of the various codes of practice try and avoid lighting fires barbecues and if you are smoking to extinguish the cigarettes and also to bring your rubbish home and keep the place looking as good as it does.”

The National Trust has launched an online fundraising appeal to help to restore the fragile landscape and bring back vital habitats for wildlife which has raised more than £9000 (€10450) to date.

After 40 years of dedicated nursing a shroud of doubt and shame hangs over Mary Harraghy’s life.

Accused of the most heinous crime she is the PSNI’s only suspect for the alleged murder of a vulnerable patient.

Cleared of wrongdoing by nursing and health authorities and with the Public Prosecution Service saying there is not enough evidence to bring a prosecution Mary says she is entirely innocent of any crime.

But she says the police she trusted to investigate the matter and free her from shame have stonewalled her.

Now 70 and having spent the last 10 years working with her husband Tommy to clear her name Mary fears she will die labelled a killer a label she claims was created by her arrest.

Mary from Magherafelt Co Derry said: “To have a patient die is difficult enough especially a patient I was very fond of. But for the police to treat the death as murder was truly shocking.

“As a nurse I worked all my life to save lives and protect the vulnerable so for the PSNI to say they suspected me to be doubted to be labelled a killer and not even given a chance to prove my innocence was absolutely devastating.”

Mary is haunted by the events of 2011 that changed her life forever.

She was cleared of any wrongdoing in the death of Seamus McCollum following inquiries by The Nursing and Midwifery Council and the Northern Trust. An inquest recorded an “undetermined” verdict.

But while the PSNI has brought no charges the case remains open.

Mary had been a nurse and midwife since the early 1970s taking a break to have three children before spending her latter career in

residential and care homes.

In 2011 she was a staff nurse at Maine Nursing Home in Randalstown Co Antrim which cared for patients with learning and physical disabilities.

On September 11 she answered a crisis call to cover the night shift.

Her decision to work that night would change her life forever leaving her she says “wrongly accused” of murdering a patient.

Since then Mary has been the only suspect in a police investigation into the alleged murder of Mr McCollum a resident at the home. At 6am on September 12 with the shift drawing to an end her colleague called Mary to the bedside of Mr McCollum saying he appeared unresponsive.

Mary said: “I ran to the room and saw he was a very bad colour.

“I told her to call 999 and get oxygen right away.

“I could find no signs of life so I started CPR and fought for him until the paramedics arrived. Sadly it wasn’t to be and a GP recorded time of death as 7.30am. Seamus was only 56.

“The loss of any patient hits all nurses hard but my sadness turned to disbelief when the police said they were dealing with a murder. I just couldn’t understand it.

“Seamus was not murdered by me my colleague the paramedics or anyone else.

“We were all there. He passed away despite everyone’s best efforts. It must have been horrendous for his family on top of their grief and to go on with no conclusion.”

In March 2012 Mary was suspended from duty.

She said: “I was stunned frightened and confused. My home was searched property seized and I was interviewed at Antrim Serious Crime Suite before being released unconditionally. My name was placed on a PSNI file and has stayed there filling my life with fear and foreboding despair depression and a feeling of shame and embarrassment that I just cannot get out from under.”

At the inquest in 2017 assistant state pathologist Dr Peter Ingram said there were “a considerable number of worrying injuries” to Seamus’ face and neck that had never been satisfactorily explained.

The inquest ruled the cause of death was undetermined and police have kept the case open.

Mary believes scuff-type marks and bruising on Seamus’ chin and neck happened when an oxygen mask repeatedly slipped and was replaced.

She said: “As the paramedics worked on Seamus they intubated him through his nose and hit a blood vessel and when I went into the room there was a blood on the floor.

“I didn’t see any marks anywhere on his neck. He’d had a small mark near his collarbone but I assumed it was a heat spot. The fact he bled out means to me he must have been alive but unresponsive when we all worked on him. It probably explains the scuff marks on his neck and chin from the mask slipping and being pulled back to position.”

But it is those marks which police suspect may have been caused by a killer.

Mary said: “I lived for my children and my career helping as many people as I could. Seamus was a lovely man who was severely disabled and non verbal but he could communicate with us he loved his films and he always had a twinkle in his eye.

“As a nurse the loss of a patient leaves a scar and some losses touch us more than others.

“Being unable to save Seamus affected me deeply but I had to be professional and go through the routine protocol of reports and records speaking to the GP notifying his family and the police.

“I went home feeling terribly sad but knowing I’d done everything I could but I was unaware his death would trigger a life sentence for me. For 10 years I’ve been hoping for an end to the trauma of being accused of something I didn’t do and being unable to prove I’m innocent.”

The Nursing and Midwifery Council investigation concluded there was no case to answer.

The postmortem pointed to a possible sepsis infection and systemic inflammatory reaction shortly before death

The Northern Trust’s safeguarding probe concluded Mary was in the clear and she has since retired.

Her husband Tommy who created the #justiceformary campaign said: “During the inquest the first police officer to attend at the scene told the court he was shocked when he saw a large pool of blood on the floor.

“When he was shown a photo of the scene he said the blood had been cleaned before the photo was taken.

“We know Mary didn’t kill Mr McCollum but we are hitting a brick wall with the PSNI.

“We trusted them to do the right thing undertake a proper inquiry and report everything accurately. But we have been terribly let down.

“The fact the death remains unexplained is due entirely to the failure of the PSNI to properly investigate the neck and chin marks. If the PSNI leaves the case unsolved and open indefinitely it effectively prevents any external party from scrutinising the case.

“The longer they do the more likely we are to become ill or die and the right thing will never be done.

“All we are asking for is the PSNI to allow an independent expert to examine the forensic file because we believe it would exonerate Mary.

“She is 70 and the last 10 years have taken a terrible physical mental and emotional toll.

“We cannot give up the fight for the truth and I will not give up my fight for my wife to cleared of suspicion of a tragic death which has been wrongly labelled a murder by a police service who seem determined to ignore the truth.”

Det Chief Insp Neil McGuinness said: “An extensive investigation was carried out into the death of Mr McCollum and it is disappointing that his family still do not have justice.

“All available investigative avenues into the death of Seamus McCollum have been explored.

“Should new information emerge that would enable detectives to further progress the case it will be rigorously followed.”

However…

The art of making incense popularly known as Turaren Wuta is no new tradition to those who come from the Northern region of Nigeria. However turaren wuta has now become a popular household item and is used by people of different tribes across the country. In this report Daily Trust Saturday x-rays how profitable the business of selling Turaren Wuta has become.

Although incense is mostly used for freshening homes and neutralising odours it also serves other different purposes. Some traditions believe that the smoke from the incense fortifies the home against evil spirits – like the ones used in the Catholic church while others believe its scents can be used to attract men or women. Some women also believe that the consistent use of Dhukkhan (a particular type of incense) serves as an aphrodisiac and can help in sexual exploits.

The popularity of the use of incense has grown to the extent that is it not only appreciated by the northern tribe but by almost all tribes around the country. Locally made incense or turaren wuta as it is popularly known in the northern region of Nigeria has become a very profitable business in Nigeria especially for those in the northern region as some of the ingredients needed are naturally grown there. Turaren wuta is used in aromatherapy and as fragrance for the home body or clothes. Aromatherapy is the use of holistic healing treatment that uses natural plant extracts to promote health and well-being.

They are different types of turaren wuta available and they are made from a variety of different materials. In Nigeria the most common scents are sandal oud grounded Kajiji Hawee balls sandal sticks etc.

The grounded Kajiji is a plant that grows in Maiduguri while Hawee sticks can be gotten from Kano. Asides from smelling good the business side of turaren wuta has been part of human existence for ages.

Fatima Kannike is an indigene of Maiduguri and specialises in the making of turaren wuta. She tells Daily Trust Saturday how profitable the business is in Nigeria. “In Maiduguri out of ten houses on the street it’s most likely that 6 or 7 families are involved in the turaren wuta business” says Fatima. When making her turaren wuta Fatima mentions that some of her ingredients are locally sourced and some come from Senegal India Pakistan etc. She further explained that the most expensive turaren wuta are the ones which contain sandalwood and firche which is gotten from crocodile skin.

“Oftentimes people believe that Prophet Mohammed (SAW) stepped on the very ground where the sandal wood tree grows therefore it is considered sacred by many” she said. When making her turaren wuta Fatima prefers using exquisite scented oils in order to make the scents from the turaren wuta last for a longer period of time which could be between 6-8 hours and most of her oils are sourced from Dubai.

“After mixing my turaren wuta I like to seal it and leave it for weeks to allow the ingredients marinate and become more potent.”

When asked what the process entails Fatima narrates: “Making turaren wuta is easy for me. As far as all my ingredients are available I can do it in the comfort of my home. It involves making a sugar syrup and frying the incense woods before adding the oils needed for the fragrance.”

However Fatima mentions that when making turaren wuta it’s often better to use firewood and the local frying pans in order to perfect the mixture. She also advises to put on a face mask to avoid catching a cold and hand gloves to avoid your hands from being burnt.

When asked how she gets her customers she explains that often times when burning her incense at home her neighbours are always interested in knowing where she gets such incense that smells good same thing also happens when she burns it at her shop. Fatima’s customer base is mostly women from the North as most times they believe that turaren wuta gives off the scent of a wealthy Arabian and also believe that it helps to attract men.

“Where I come from turaren wuta is considered an important gift on your wedding for the women even more important than getting a fridge or TV” she said.

However Fatima notes that in recent times she has also received a lot of female customers from the eastern part of the country. Although her customer base is mostly women she also has male customers who buy the body oils and incense for their cars.

Fatima has turaren wuta of different price range and sizes depending on the ingredients used. Fatima also sells her turaren wuta in litres for those who may like to join the business and not want to go through the stress of making it themselves.

“Depending on how big you want to start getting into the business doesn’t need that much capital. For instance with 100000 naira you can get two to three varieties of turaren wuta in litres to resale with another sum of 400000 you can purchase three to five varieties of scents.”

Asides the turaren wuta Fatima also makes humrah which is the body oil and can be used on clothes.

“Often times because of how good the smell is customers are always indecisive about what scent they want. When issues like that arise we like to burn each scent and allow the customer to decide which scent they like the most” Fatima said.

She also advises her customers to use a charcoal burner instead of an electric burner because from experience the electric burner wastes the turaren wuta and doesn’t burn as effectively as the charcoal.

Fatima’s most patronised scents are the sandal Oud grounded kajiji and Halut. She notes that these particular scents get sold out the minute her customers are aware of its availability. Fatima also mentioned that her sales peak season is the rainy season this is because the smoke that comes from the incense burner aides in keeping the house warm so customers are always willing to purchase more.

Mrs Amina Kogi an ardent lover of turaren wuta told Daily Trust Saturday that she spends at least N20000 monthly purchasing different fragrance of turaren wuta for her house. “Whenever I wake up in the morning I tell the maid to burn incense round the house and doing that makes the house smell good and homely.”

Mrs Amina also told Daily Trust Saturday that most of her guests express delight over the pleasant scent in her home and insist on getting the contact of the person she purchased the incense from.

However another turaren wuta seller Rahanatu Ahmad in Abuja told Daily Trust Saturday that she doesn’t believe that turaren wuta has any spiritual benefits asides it sweet scent and its potency in clearing or diffusing bad/offensive odour. She noted that the business is more profitable when sold in larger quantities. Her cheapest turaren wuta goes for N3500 and the most expensive N23000. The prices all depends on the size of jars. She also produces Durot – a special kind of turaren wuta that is sometimes considered medicinal. She advises her female customers to purchase this particular turaren wuta to help fight minor infections and leave them feeling fresh and good. She told our reporter that her most patronised scents are the Desired orbs and Thirteen scents."

This aircraft meant to serve as the successor to the legendary stealth B-2 Spirit is expected to combine elements of existing stealth aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter with entirely new technologies and production methodologies. The result the Air Force expects will be the most advanced bomber ever to take to the skies… and just in time as both China and Russia continue to pour funding into their own stealth bomber programs.

The B-21 is expected to enter service later this decades with its first flight scheduled for next year. Once in service it’s slated to replace both the B-2 Spirit and B-1B Lancer.

Watch “B-21 Raider: The Most Advanced Bomber Ever”

This video was based on research and analysis provided in this article about the platform and this article about how the B-21 could affect America’s defensive posture in the Pacific.

Northrop Grumman’s B-21 program has been a clinic in secrecy with very few hard facts surfacing about the platform since the contract to build it was awarded to the aviation firm in 2015. What we know for sure is that the aircraft was purpose-built from the ground up to replace at least two-thirds of America’s aging heavy bomber fleet. Currently the U.S. relies on the nuclear-capable B-52 Stratofortress the supersonic B-1B Lancer and the stealthy B-2 Spirit for heavy bombing missions the world over. Once the B-21 enters service both the B-2 Spirit and B-1b Lancer will begin retiring out of service with the mighty B-52 remaining on duty for decades to come.

The single artist’s rendering of the B-21 Raider that’s been released thus far shows clearly that this new stealth bomber will lean heavily on the design of its predecessor the B-2 Spirit but the B-21 is expected to offer a significant improvement in stealth capabilities thanks to updated systems improved radar-absorbent coating and the same basic engine systems found in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Thanks to America’s continued work on stealth technologies the B-21 should be harder to detect than any bomber in history but without the massive price tag associated with previous stealth programs.

The new capability would help the Air Force replace a capability now performed by the Northrop Grumman E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (J-Stars) fleet. The E-8C which is scheduled for retirement in 2025 carries the APY-7 synthetic aperture radar which has a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) mode.

U.S. Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office began risk reduction in 2018

Space Force plans to partner with commercial companies

“The Space Force has a program where we’re building GMTI from space” Gen. John Raymond the service’s chief of space operations said May 12 at the McAleese Defense Programs Conference in Washington.

The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office began the program in 2018 identifying technologies and risk reduction efforts according to spokeswoman Col. Catie Hague. “The program office has been focused on managing risk while meeting a schedule accommodating the planned retirement of the [U.S. Air Force’s] J-Stars” she says.

“Space-based GMTI will provide another way to harness data from the space domain and incorporate it into the secure cloud environment underpinning the Advanced Battle Management System to sense make sense and act faster than our adversaries” Hague says.

The Space Force opted to declassify the existence of the still-developmental satellite effort just as combatant commanders from U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (Indo-Pacom) are asking Congress to support it. Indo-Pacom commanders have pledged to add $2.3 billion to the organization’s unfunded priorities list for a Space-Based Persistent Radar that can conduct the GMTI and airborne moving-target indication missions (AW&ST March 22-April 4 p. 22).

And Indo-Pacom has discussed a vision for partnering with commercial companies to establish a GMTI capability in space. The Space Force is also planning to turn to commercial industry where advances in space-based radars appear to be making the change possible.

“We’re going to leverage commercial more than we’ve done in the past” Raymond said. “We’re going to try to have a strong partnership between our force and commercial [companies].”

The task of detecting moving targets on the ground is daunting. It requires a satellite moving at orbital speed to track comparatively slow-moving targets on the ground against background clutter at great distances.

The Defense Department and the intelligence community have made several attempts since the late 1990s to develop a space-based radar with a GMTI mode including the canceled Discoverer II and Space Radar programs.

A paper on space-based radar physics provided to Aviation Week highlights the technical challenges.

By definition a space radar is significantly farther away from the target area than an airborne radar operating below 45000 ft. (13.7 km/8.5 mi.). The greater distance requires either a larger antenna more power a higher pulse rate or some combination of all three.

For a satellite in low Earth orbit (LEO) at around 500 km the difference is a factor of 25.5. That means the E-8C’s radar antenna needs to be only 4.43 m2 (48 ft.2) at a 45000-ft. altitude to achieve the same signal-to-noise ratio as a 113 m2 antenna in LEO at 500 km assuming both share the same power output and pulse rate.

The difference expands significantly at altitudes above 2000 km in medium Earth orbit (MEO) rising to a factor of 4223. In theory that would translate to an antenna 18707 m2 in area.

By combining increases in antenna size power output and pulse rate however space radar designers have been able to achieve impressive results over the past decade in orbital experiments. Although using an antenna measuring 22.5 m2 Canada’s Radarsat-2 for example tracked cars moving as slow as 8.3 kph (5.2 mph) in 2012. China’s Gaofen-3 satellite meanwhile also experimented with a GMTI software mode during a 2016 orbital test.

As a military capability a single satellite at LEO or MEO altitudes compares poorly to the persistence of an E-8C which can fly a 9-hr. mission. At orbital speeds satellites remain over an operational theater-sized area for only minutes leaving huge gaps in coverage that pop-up threats could exploit.

To achieve persistence from space a constellation of satellites is necessary. Capella Space a commercial provider is for example planning to launch a constellation of 36 microsatellites to provide global coverage with synthetic aperture radars. But Capella has not advertised a GMTI capability as a commercial service and its constellation is not designed to provide seamless global coverage anyway.",,,,,,,,,

NVIDIA Kepler GPU Architecture To See Its Retirement With R470 GeForce Drivers

As reported by Phoronix the NVIDIA R470 series drivers are labeled as LTSB (Long-Term Support) for the Kepler GPU series and as such will maintain support for the said architecture for 3 years after which it would be retired along with the GPUs. The NVIDIA Kepler GPU architecture has been supported for generations but as time goes by older GPU architectures are removed from official support lists.

NVIDIA ended driver support for its Fermi (GeForce 400 / 500 Series) back in 2018 moving it to legacy status. The same is expected to happen with the Kepler-based GeForce 600 / 700 series when NVIDIA moves beyond R470 drivers. The last DRV drivers (regular driver release branch) are going to ship for the next few months before a new driver/feature brand is introduced & support finally ends for the Kepler generation.

Looking back at Kepler the GPU architecture brought NVIDIA back in the fight with mainstream chips competing against flagship parts from AMD. NVIDIA also focused a lot on efficiency which made it win in latter generations such as Maxwell and Pascal. The Kepler series did take a huge blow when AMD fired back with its Hawaii GPUs in 2013 but lept back in the game with Maxwell a year later. The following chart from NVIDIA shows the CUDA and driver support plan for current GPU architectures:

So if you’re running one of those cards you’ll need to bear that in mind (although note that the GTX 750 and its Ti variant are Maxwell not Kepler). Of course at this point even the newer GTX 700 series is eight years old now so it’s going to be a shaky proposition in terms of contemporary gaming at this point anyway.

As VideoCardz which spotted Phoronix flagging this up courtesy of Nvidia’s data center documentation points out the R470 driver family will be the last to support graphics cards built with the Kepler architecture. We are currently on the R465 family of drivers specifically version 466.47 which was released earlier this week with R470 expected to debut in 2021 likely fairly soon.

Once Nvidia moves to the next driver generation (presumably R475) – perhaps by the end of 2021 or early 2022 – the GTX 600 and 700 cards will no longer be supported in terms of optimization for games meaning they’ll gradually deliver worse performance as time goes on.

Security fixes

Do note though that these GPUs will then be in LTS or long-term support with the R470 driver so while the driver will no longer cater for optimization needs it will still provide security fixes for any major vulnerabilities that could pop up in the future.

Nvidia will deliver LTS support through until 2024 keeping Kepler users safe from security holes for another few years yet – meaning that GTX 600 graphics cards will actually be supported for a full 12 years from a security standpoint a commendable length of time.

Nvidia’s Maxwell GPUs meaning the GTX 750 and GTX 900 series cards will be next in line for the driver chopping block of course but that shouldn’t be for a while yet (likely a couple of years down the line).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtdG8tZW5kLWtlcGxlci1hcmNoaXRlY3R1cmUtc3VwcG9ydC13aXRoLXI0NzAtZHJpdmVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA to end Kepler architecture support with R470 drivers,"NVIDIA GeForce 600/700 going for retirement soon

NVIDIA R470 branch drivers will be the last to support Kepler architecture.

According to NVIDIA’s Data Center Documentation the R470 branch of the NVIDIA graphics driver will be the last to support Kepler architecture while Maxwell and Pascal’s support is to be maintained. The current R460 branch has been used by NVIDIA since the end of last year. Each branch usually is kept for a few months usually about half of a year. This means that R470 branch supporting may be retired by a new branch by the end of this year. In other words drivers for Kepler-based GeForce Quadro and Tesla products regular driver support is to be maintained for the next few months then the drivers will shift to less regular updates.

Phoronix reports after NVIDIA that Linux R470 branch long-term support (LTSB) is to be maintained for 3 years. The LTSB branch is meant for data center accelerators which require regular updates than consumer or workstation products. This of course does not reflect Windows ‘Game Ready’ drivers. To play the latest games users will be encouraged to upgrade their graphics to something more modern.

NVIDIA introduced Kepler architecture debuted in 2012 with GeForce GTX 600 series. It was also powering the GTX 700 series which were released a year later.

Acer Nitro 5 (AN515-54) specs Price: $999

CPU: Intel Core i7-9750H

GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060

RAM: 16GB

Storage: 256GB SSD

Display: 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 144Hz

Battery: 7:06

Size: 14.3 x 10 x 1.0 inches

Weight: 4.85 pounds

The Acer Nitro 5 a budget gaming laptop under $1000 is a carefully curated rig that makes the right concessions to attract bargain-hunting gamers. Acer wanted to offer consumers a decent graphics card at a wallet-friendly price so it sacrificed a premium build quality and a bright colorful display to make room for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU.

The Nitro 5 isn’t for bougie gamers — I’m talking to you pretentious players who wouldn’t touch an all-plastic laptop with a ten-foot pole fancy folk who believe dim displays are for peasants and CPU snobs who only use the latest processors. These types would balk at the thought of using this gaming rig. This Acer laptop is for down-to-earth gamers who are willing to accept a few trade-offs in favor of a better discrete graphics card.

If you turn your nose up at lackluster screens odd keyboard layouts and cheaply built gaming rigs you may not be satisfied with the Nitro 5. However if you’re a sucker for crimson-and-onyx motifs impressive mid-range GPUs and decent VR performance at an affordable price the Nitro 5 is an excellent choice.

Acer Nitro 5 price and configuration options

The Acer Nitro 5 starts at $829.99 and comes with a quad-core Intel Core i5-10300H CPU an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti GPU with 4GB of VRAM 8GB of RAM a 256GB NVMe SSD and a 15.6-inch 144Hz display.

My review model costs $999 and comes with the same storage and display but swaps out the processor graphics and memory for a hexa-core Intel Core i7-9750H CPU an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 6GB of VRAM and 16GB of RAM respectively.

Acer Nitro 5 design

The Acer Nitro 5 looks like it’s been ripped from Optimus Prime’s robotic build and welded into a badass gaming rig with an eye-catching red-and-black motif. A glossy but subtle Acer logo sits in the center of the onyx-coated lid. The lid features two textures: a smooth fingerprint-attracting black center flanked by a funky hexagonal-pattern design.

An attractive red hinge with the word “Nitro” connects the display to the deck. Acer adorns the Nitro 5 with red-trim accents around the keyboard keys and touchpad. The Nitro 5’s chassis is made out of plastic — and it shows. If you press down on the lid you’ll notice some flex and a lack of sturdiness. The palm rest is more solid than the lid but certainly still feels cheap. One of the trade-offs you’ll make with this budget gaming laptop is build quality.

Acer tries to distract you from the display’s ultra-thick bezels with visually pleasing bevel-edge corners but there’s no ignoring the Nitro 5’s chunky frames. The gigantic chin is the largest bezel sporting a glossy Acer logo. The Nitro 5 has four rubber feet on each corner making room for a large edge-to-edge ventilation grill.

At 4.9 pounds and 14.3 x 10 x 1 inches the Acer Nitro 5 is lighter than its three budget gaming rivals: the Asus ROG Strix G15 (5.3 pounds 14.2 x 10.8 x 1 inches) Dell G5 15 SE (5.5 pounds 14.4 x 10 x 0.9 inches) and the Lenovo Legion 5 (5.4 pounds 14.3 x 10 x 0.9 inches).

Acer Nitro 5 ports

The Acer Nitro 5 has an OK stock of ports .

On the left side you’ll find a Kensington lock slot  an RJ45 Ethernet port an HDMI 2.0 port a USB Type-C port and two USB Type-A ports . On the right side you’ll discover a headset jack and another USB Type-A port.

Acer Nitro 5 display

The Nitro’s 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080-pixel display looked surprisingly sharp and detailed as I watched The Mauritanian trailer on YouTube. I could spot every wrinkle and pore on Benedict Cumberbatch’s face. I could make out the cute tiny freckles that populate Shailene Woodley’s cheeks. However Jodie Foster’s striking blue eyes and red lips could have been bolder and more vivid on the Nitro 5’s display. Still the Acer laptop offers a satisfactory visual experience.

I loved how the display accurately showed Agent 47’s transition from the muggy wilderness — cloudy with a misty haze — to a less humid environment with muddy streets and run-down brick homes. Of course being that the Nitro 5 is equipped with a 1080p screen it won’t win any awards but I was pleased with the game’s visuals on Nitro 5’s IPS display.

I hope you don’t sit near a bright window — Nitro 5 is pretty darn dim. The Acer laptop’s display emanates only 245 nits of brightness  which is dimmer than the average budget gaming laptop (271 nits). The ROG Strix G15 (251 nits) G5 15 SE (301 nits) and Legion 5 (287 nits) are all brighter than the Nitro 5 but not by much.

The Nitro 5 also covers 45% of the DCI-P3 color gamut which is eight percentage points less than the 53% category average. The ROG Strix G15 covers 1% more of the DCI-P3 color space than the Nitro 5 (46%). The G5 15 SE takes the crown as having the most colorful display (77%). The Legion 5 fares the worst with an embarrassing color-coverage score of 40%.

With a Delta-E score of 0.33 the Nitro 5 is less color accurate than the 0.3 score of the average budget laptop (the closer the score is to zero the better). The Nitro 5 is also less color accurate than the G5 15 SE and Legion 5 which share a Delta-E score of 0.26 but the Acer gaming rig defeated the ROG Strix G15’s score by a hair (0.34).

Acer Nitro 5 keyboard and touchpad

Meh! I’m not a big fan of the Nitro 5’s less-than-impressive keyboard. But admittedly it has some positive aspects so let’s start there. The oft-used keys in PC gaming (i.e. the W A S D and arrow keys) are outlined with a thick red trim to help them stand out on the keyboard. There is one additional key outlined in red: a dedicated “N” key located within the top-left corner of the full-sized numpad to quick-launch the NitroSense app for fan control.

The keyboard’s island-style red-and-black color scheme panders to my personal tastes — I have a weakness for crimson-and-onyx motifs. I even love the red backlighting which has four brightness tiers. Unfortunately if you’re not a fan of red-backlit keys you’ll be disappointed to know that the Nitro 5 doesn’t feature customizable RGB-key lighting so you’re stuck with red. You can always turn off the red backlight but the dark-red symbols superimposed on black keys are a tad difficult to see.

While I love how the keyboard looks I cannot stand how it feels. I hated typing on this laptop so much I angrily gave up on it while typing this review in Google Docs . I scored 84 words per minute on the 10fastfingers.com typing test which is a slight regression from my typical 85-wpm typing speed. One of the Nitro 5’s biggest offenses is its shortened Shift key — an issue I addressed in 2020 laptop trends that must die . Capitalizing letters is a pain in the rear; instead of landing on the Shift key I often ended up on the up-arrow key which sent the blinking text cursor flying to another paragraph. Another gripe I have with the Nitro 5 keyboard is its poorly placed power button — I am not a fan of power buttons integrated into the keyboard sorry.

The Nitro 5’s 4.2 x 3.1-inch touchpad is fine offering a satisfactory clicking experience. It’s also responsive to Windows 10 gestures  like two-finger scrolling and three-finger tabbing. However when I don’t have a gaming mouse handy I prefer touchpads with dedicated left-and-right buttons. While playing Dishonored 2 I found myself landing on the wrong side of the touchpad causing me to accidentally fire my pistol and alert nearby enemies of my presence. I had to run for my life — so much for stealth gameplay.

Acer Nitro 5 audio

The dual speakers tuned by Waves MaxxAudio are on the left and right corners of the bottom chassis. I played Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas” on Spotify and wished the sound was slightly louder — the Christmas classic didn’t fill my large testing room.

The holiday jingle sounded a bit flat and congested as it emanated from the oddly placed bottom-firing speakers. There is a Waves Maxx Audio app to tweak the audio to your liking. There are several presets including Gaming General Gaming FPS Gaming Sports Movies Music and Voice. I played around with all six profiles — none of the presets enhanced the audio but the Gaming Sports profile sounded the worst adding too much grit and rasp to the smooth-sounding holiday jam.

While playing Dishonored 2 on the Nitro 5 I preferred the Gaming General preset which provided well-balanced sound for both the characters’ voices and the background music. Dishonored 2 is one of those games where you’ll need to rely on sound to detect whether an enemy is nearby and of course being that the Nitro 5 is a budget gaming laptop it won’t offer a surround-sound experience. Overall the speakers are simply OK.

Acer Nitro 5 gaming graphics and VR

The Nitro 5’s graphics are powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 2060 GPU and 6GB of VRAM  which is a great graphical engine for a budget gaming laptop.

Cranking up the graphics settings to Ultra I crept through a beautiful abandoned mansion in a fantasized English city in Dishonored 2. I loved that I could make out the different textures in the mansion from a wooden ceiling fan to the off-white marble floors. I could also spot some nifty ray-tracing details including a soft realistic glow from a leather chair located near a light source and a bright glare from a painting placed inside a glass frame.

On the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark (Highest 1080p) the Nitro 5 hovered around 52 frames per second which outpaced the budget gaming laptop average (36 fps). The ROG Strix G15 powered by an Nvidia GeForce RTX 1650 Ti GPU  fell short against the Nitro 5 (40 fps). The G5 15 SE armed with an AMD Radeon RX 5600M GPU also fell short of the Acer gaming rig (45 fps). The Nitro 5 finally met its match with the Legion 5. Powered by a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti  the Lenovo laptop offered the same score as the Acer laptop (52 fps).

The Nitro 5 averaged 67 frames per second on the Grand Theft Auto V benchmark (Very High 1080p) which crushed the 48-fps category average. The ROG Strix G15 could only muster 44 fps. The G5 15 SE and the Legion 5 also failed to reach the Nitro 5’s glory with just 56 and 64 fps respectively.

On the Metro Exodus benchmark (Ultra 1080p) the Nitro 5 climbed to 47 fps beating the 36-fps category average. The ROG Strix G15 only offered 30 fps. The G5 15 and the Legion 5 came close to the Nitro 5 with 46 fps and 42 fps respectively but the Dell and the Lenovo laptops couldn’t surpass Acer.

When we ran 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra the Nitro 5 (3696) crushed the category average (2919) the ROG Strix G15 (2197) and the Legion 5 (3180) but the G5 15 SE killed the Acer’s winning streak with a knock-out score of 4360.

If you’re wondering whether the Nitro 5 can handle VR you’ll be happy to know that the Acer gaming rig slew the VRMark Orange Room benchmark with a score of 7116 sailing past the average budget gaming laptop (5415). The Nitro 5 also defeated the ROG Strix G15 (5259) the G5 15 SE (7237) and the Legion 5 (5013).

Acer Nitro 5 performance

The Nitro 5 packs 16GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7-9750H CPU (a mid-tier processor that is a generation behind as of this writing). The Acer laptop managed to juggle 45 Google Chrome tabs and three YouTube videos without a hitch.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

Despite its obsolete CPU the Nitro 5 served up a score of 5435 which beats the category average (4696) and the Core i7-10750H processors inside both the ROG Strix G15 (5168) and the Legion 5 (5325). However the Nitro 5 couldn’t keep up with G5 15 SE’s AMD Ryzen R7 4800H CPU which outputted a spectacular score of 7715.

The Nitro 5 took 11 minutes and 41 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p on our HandBrake benchmark failing to surpass the category average (11:25). The ROG Strix G15 (10:28) G5 15 SE (6:43) and Legion 5 (10:05) were quicker than the Acer gaming rig.

When we ran the file transfer test the Nitro 5’s 256GB SSD duplicated 4.97GB of multimedia files in 18 seconds at a transfer rate of 301 megabytes per second. This is a tinge faster than the category average (285 MBps). The Nitro 5 also beat the 512GB SSDs inside the ROG Strix G15 (129 MBps) and the Legion 5 (200 MBps). However the Acer laptop couldn’t keep up with the G5 15 SE (452 MBps) which also sports a 512GB SSD.

Acer Nitro 5 battery life

The Nitro 5 has decent battery life for a budget gaming laptop.

The Acer gaming rig lasted 7 hours and 6 minutes on the Laptop Mag battery test (continuous surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness) which outlasted the average budget gaming laptop (6:56). The Nitro 5 also has more endurance than the ROG Strix G15 (5:11). The G5 15 SE (7:14) and the Legion 5 (7:13) lasted 8 minutes and 7 minutes longer than the Nitro 5 respectively.

Acer Nitro 5 heat

After gaming for 15 minutes the Nitro 5’s underside reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit which is slightly above our 95-degree comfort threshold. The center of the keyboard and touchpad hit 107 and 77 degrees respectively. The hottest location of the laptop is the underside near the vents which climbed to 119 degrees.

After playing a 15-minute 1080p YouTube video the Nitro 5 remained relatively cool under the hood showing off the advantage of its plastic chassis. The Acer laptop’s center (88 degrees) touchpad (76 degrees) and underside (87 degrees) all hovered below the 95-degree comfort threshold. Again the hottest location was the underside (near the vents) reaching 91 degrees.

Acer Nitro 5 software and warranty

Bottom line

The Acer Nitro 5 is a solid budget gaming laptop with competition-beating frame rates and VR score. However there is one laptop that consistently kept outperforming the Nitro 5 during our testing: the Dell G5 15 SE .

The $829 G5 15 SE kicked the $999 Nitro 5’s butt. The AMD-equipped Dell gaming rig sports a punchier display more storage zippier file-transfer and video-editing rates and better overall performance.

On the plus side the Nitro 5 crushed the G5 15 SE — and its other rivals — when it comes to gaming frame rates offering an average of nine more frames than the Dell laptop. It also surpassed all of its competitors on the VRMark Orange Room benchmark.

If decent VR performance and higher frame rates appeal to you get the Nitro 5 but if you prefer a better display a blisteringly fast CPU and more storage at a sub-$1000 price tag the G5 15 SE is the better option.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA4MC10aS1ydHgtMzA3MC10aS1hbHJlYWR5LWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi1yYXplci1kZXNrdG9wLXBjLXByZW9yZGVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GeForce RTX 3080 Ti RTX 3070 Ti Already Available In Razer Desktop PC Preorders,"



The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti are perhaps two of the worst kept secrets in the gaming hardware realm. The two Ampere SKUs have been rumored for months and recently we've been able to pin down exact announcement and launch windows for both cards.

Now it looks as though Razer's Chinese arm has jumped the gun by making the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti available in its preconfigured desktop systems. Systems are currently available for preorder on Razer's official store on the Tmall e-commerce platform. The listings were first discovered by @harukaze5719 on Twitter.

There are multiple configurations available including an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X system with 16GB of DDR4-3200 memory an ROG Strix B550-A motherboard an 850W 80PLUS PSU and one of NVIDIA's newfangled GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards (in this case with 12GB of GDDR6X memory).

For those that don't mind stepping down a rung or two on the performance ladder there's a Ryzen 5 5600X configuration with a B550 M-ATX motherboard 16GB of DDR4-3000 memory a 750W 80PLUS PSU and the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti (8GB GDDR6X).

The memory specs for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti match up with previous leaks that we've seen. The former will be the most potent of the two of course with a total of 10240 CUDA cores. The latter however will feature ""only"" 6144 CUDA cores. Both cards will outperform their GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 counterparts but the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti should be within earshot of the flagship GeForce RTX 3090 when it comes to performance -- and with a lower price tag.





However we all know that finding either a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or GeForce RTX 3070 Ti -- outside of prebuilt systems from OEMs -- will be next to impossible at whatever MSRP NVIDIA gives them at launch. With the current GeForce RTX 30 Series cards going for two to three times their MSRP depending on the model we don't have high hopes for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti.

It's rumored that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti will be officially announced on May 31st during an NVIDIA Computex 2021 keynote address. The cards will then go on sale on June 3rd and June 10th respectively."

The money would plug hundreds of abandoned wells and restore the often-polluted land surrounding them and in the process would employ oilfield workers who had been furloughed after prices crashed.

The program largely accomplished those goals. But some environmental advocates say it achieved another they didn’t expect: It bailed out dozens of small to mid-sized oil companies relieving them of their responsibility to pay for cleaning up their own wells by using taxpayer money instead.

Oil drillers are generally required to plug their wells after they’re done producing crude. But in practice companies are often able to defer that responsibility for years or decades. Larger companies often sell older wells to smaller ones which sometimes go bankrupt leaving the wells with no owner.

These “orphaned wells” become the responsibility of the federal or state governments depending on where they were drilled. While oil companies are required to post bonds or other financial assurance to pay for plugging them in reality those bonds cover only a tiny fraction of the costs leaving taxpayers on the hook. One estimate by the Carbon Tracker Initiative a financial think tank found that those bonds cover only a tiny fraction of the expected costs of cleaning up the nation’s oil and gas wells.

But in North Dakota it turned out that most of the wells the state plugged were not truly orphaned but had solvent owners. After the industry warned last year that the pandemic-driven oil-crash was threatening its finances state regulators stepped in assumed ownership of more than 300 wells and used CARES Act funds to plug them meaning the companies avoided paying anything themselves.

“What happened was a bunch of people got a free ride” said Scott Skokos executive director of the Dakota Resource Council a grassroots environmental group in the state.

Skokos said it only deepened his sense that the state had bailed out the industry. In October regulators were granted permission from state lawmakers to send about $16 million of the CARES Act funds as grants to oil companies to help them buy water to hydraulically fracture new wells a step the regulators said was necessary to expend the funds by the end of the year. Nine companies took advantage of the program. In one case a single company Continental Resources received $5.4 million according to state records.

Wyoming also sent about $30 million in Covid relief funds to oil companies as grants to either frack new wells or revive or plug old ones.

Some advocates say that such well-plugging programs highlight a larger problem: Millions of aging unplugged oil and gas wells dot the ground from Appalachia to California often carrying oil and toxins to the surface contaminating groundwater and leaking climate-warming methane gas into the atmosphere.

The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the nation’s unplugged wells leaked about 263000 tons of methane in 2019 which when compared to carbon dioxide over a 20-year period is equivalent to the climate-warming emissions of more than 5 coal-fired power plants. The agency added that the actual figure could be significantly smaller or three times greater.

While many of the wells—hundreds of thousands at least—are orphaned many more are still operated by oil companies that critics say have avoided plugging them because of regulations that allow the industry to postpone cleaning them indefinitely eventually dumping the responsibility on taxpayers.

President Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan calls for spending $16 billion to clean up the nation’s orphaned wells and coal and hardrock mines and lawmakers have drafted bills with similar goals.

Environmentalists leaders in both political parties and the oil industry all support directing federal dollars to plug orphaned wells as a way to address climate change and pollution while creating jobs for oilfield workers. But some advocates say that what happened in North Dakota shows the risks of spending billions of dollars without sufficient scrutiny and without requiring oil companies to put up more money to pay for plugging their wells.

“There’s an incredible opportunity to begin cleaning up and better cataloging orphan wells while creating well-paying jobs” said Sara Cawley a legislative representative for Earthjustice an environmental nonprofit. But she said any federal spending needs to be tied with regulatory reforms including requiring companies to set aside more money for plugging “so that taxpayers are not continuing to pay for clean-up in perpetuity.”

Two bills have been introduced so far. Both would direct billions of dollars to plug orphaned wells on state federal and tribal lands and both include language that would encourage states to improve well-plugging regulations by tying a portion of the funding to reforms. Only one however by Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) would require oil companies to purchase more expensive bonds when drilling on federal land leaving more money available in case of default.

Lynn Helms director of North Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources defended the state’s program from criticism that it bailed out the industry saying it targeted companies that were facing financial stress because of last year’s crash in oil prices and that in some cases small mom-and-pop operations did not have the funds to plug the wells. He said his department has begun to pursue reimbursement from some of the companies that are still solvent and has already obtained more than $3 million to reimburse a state well-plugging fund that covered some costs beyond the $66 million from the CARES Act.

He said the program served the intent of the CARES Act—to stimulate the economy and support employment—by creating more than 3700 jobs “and that was the number one purpose for why we did this.”

Helms said the $16 million in grants for fracking was also intended to support workers and state finances which are highly dependent on tax revenues from oil production. The grants he said supported about 600 jobs and boosted production in December shoring up funding for schools and other programs. While he acknowledged that Continental and other companies were essentially given a multi-million dollar discount “that wasn’t the purpose” he said.

Some environmental advocates have countered that whatever the intent North Dakota effectively gave the oil industry a backdoor subsidy and sent an implicit signal that taxpayers will come to its rescue when times are tough.

“In North Dakota I think the story is in some ways a fairly succinct one” said Nikki Reisch director of the climate and energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law which highlighted the state’s program in a recent report. “Taxpayer dollars were being used to pick up polluters’ tabs while at the same the state was repurposing federal funds to support new fracking making the very same problem worse.”

’Pollution Vectors’

No one knows how many old wells are scattered across the nation’s oil and gas fields. According to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission states have identified nearly 57000 orphaned wells but estimate there are hundreds of thousands more undocumented ones. The EPA has estimated there are more than 3 million abandoned wells regardless of whether they have owners or not. Often companies can avoid plugging wells when they are no longer productive by calling them idled a status that can last decades.

Locally old wells can contaminate groundwater and foul farmland spewing not only petroleum but also toxic highly salty water. Abandoned well sites render sections of farmers’ fields unusable.

Companies are generally required to purchase bonds when they drill wells as a form of insurance—governments can confiscate the bonds if companies fail to plug their own wells. Lawmakers or regulators determine the levels for those bonds—for example $10000 per well or $150000 for all a company’s wells within a state—but in many cases those levels were set decades ago and barely begin to cover plugging costs.

Carbon Tracker has collected data on more than 2.4 million catalogued unplugged wells including all the nation’s active wells and has estimated it would cost about $288 billion to plug them. But its analysis showed that state and federal bonds would cover only about 1 percent of that cost raising the question of who will pay the difference if companies go bankrupt or fail to plug their wells. That estimate for the coverage of bonds excluded Texas for which Carbon Tracker was unable to obtain data. Last week New Mexico’s State Land Office released a report that found that oil company bonds in the state covered 2 percent of the expected cleanup costs falling $8.1 billion short.

Rob Schuwerk executive director of Carbon Tracker’s North American office said the looming transition away from oil and gas will make the problem worse. It is one thing if industry revenues are stable or growing and companies only occasionally bail on their cleanup responsibilities. But if oil and gas demand begins to decline the industry is likely to face falling revenues and a spike in bankruptcies just as companies abandon a wave of unprofitable wells. They might not have money to plug their own wells leaving taxpayers on the hook.

Last year served as a preview when global lockdowns sent oil demand plummeting. In North Dakota that meant oil companies had to shut their wells and layoff workers as their revenues dwindled.

The conditions prompted warnings of bankruptcies and led regulators to ask the state to spend CARES Act relief funds on plugging and remediating abandoned wells which they warned could become orphaned if not addressed.

In order to plug the wells the state had to assume ownership of them a step that was welcomed by Ron Ness who runs the North Dakota Petroleum Council which represents the industry. But at a state hearing last year Ness warned regulators against also seizing the bonds companies had bought as insurance for plugging the wells. Although the bonds might help pay plugging costs seizing them would have “very real” impacts that would prove to be “extremely problematic” Ness said.

Ness argued that the CARES Act was effectively reimbursing the state for the cost of plugging the wells. If regulators did seize the bonds he argued the state could have to return funds to the federal government.

The petroleum council did not respond to phone messages or emails. But Schuwerk said that confiscating a bond could pose problems for the company that purchased it. Bond companies could suddenly view that company as a risk and require it to pay higher premiums for its other bonds for example driving up drilling costs.

Regulators have largely granted Ness’s request at least so far. According to data provided by the Department of Mineral Resources the state confiscated 320 wells and had plugged 280 as of May at a cost of $39.3 million including $6.1 million that came from a state well-plugging fund financed with industry fees and penalties and taxes on production. The state “reclaimed”—or cleaned up—only 173 of the sites.

But so far the state has confiscated bonds worth only about $3.4 million while it is pursuing another $1.5 million through civil action Helms said. All of that money would go to reimburse the state fund rather than the CARES Act money. Helms said that while they are still looking into it the rules of the CARES Act may dictate that the state cannot or should not reimburse the federal government.

The department said that seven companies responsible for 77 of the confiscated wells have either entered bankruptcy or were determined to be insolvent. The rest of the wells however were owned by companies that continue to pump oil in the state.

Cobra Oil and Gas for example had 121 wells confiscated. State records say the Texas-based company has another 369 active wells suggesting there may have been revenue to cover plugging costs. Cobra did not respond to phone messages or emails.

Helms said companies like Cobra “are not off the hook” adding “I don’t think I can tell you that we’re going to pursue full reimbursement but I think I can commit we’re going to pursue at least some reimbursement from those companies.”

Helms said the North Dakota Legislature has made changes in bonding and regulations in recent years that are intended to prevent the 14000 wells that have been drilled in North Dakota over the past decade from facing a similar fate. Wells that have been idled for 18 months for example are now required to have dedicated bonds rather than being covered by a “blanket bond” for all of a company’s wells in the state.

Wyoming also sent CARES Act funds as grants to oil companies which they could use to frack wells they had already drilled or to plug older wells. According to data provided by the Wyoming Business Council which administered the funds Devon Energy received nearly $5.8 million which it used both to frack new wells and plug old ones. Six other companies including Occidental Petroleum received more than $1 million each.

Randall Luthi chief energy advisor to Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement to Inside Climate News that the spending was “completely appropriate” adding that thousands of people in the state were unable to find work last year. He said the program provided “an economic and environmental shot in the arm for Wyoming at a time when it was needed” and that “CARES money was always intended for solvent but struggling companies.”

Neither Devon Occidental nor Continental Resources responded to requests for comment.

Skokos of the Dakota Resource Council said he supported cleaning up old wells but that the way it was administered was “basically a bailout for the industry.”

“We could have been using that money for other things like paid family leave or money for actual workers increasing unemployment” he said. “There’s people that were struggling.”

Adam Peltz a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund said it was unlikely that any federal efforts to plug orphaned wells would be spent on wells with solvent owners as it was in North Dakota and Wyoming.

“The overwhelming vast majority of this money will be spent on pre-regulatory wells that really have not a trace of an owner on record” he said. Pennsylvania Ohio and other eastern states where some of the first oil wells were drilled for example have hundreds of thousands of orphaned wells and little funding to plug them. “And they’re just going to sit there as pollution vectors” Peltz said “until and unless we come up with a lot of money to plug them. The good news is we’re in a moment where money is flowing for good causes.”

He noted that some states including North Dakota have also begun to improve their bonding requirements.

But Reisch of the Center for International Environmental Law warned that those changes have hardly begun closing the gap.

“The looming legacy of the oil and gas industry and of the fossil fuel economy is really going to be this ghost infrastructure and these toxic wells” she said. “The magnitude of the problem and the funds needed to address it properly is really daunting.”

In some cases and some places.

Colorado a major oil and gas producer has what is considered the country’s strongest setback rule: a well site must be at least 2000 feet back from homes and schools.

Tougher protections for air quality and wildlife more stringent requirements for well construction and other changes in operations do apply to sites approved under the old rules. But permits approved before Jan.15 fall under the looser setback limits. And there are thousands of them.

“We’ve spent a year a half working on mission-change rules and now we’re still watching neighborhoods just get fracked over and over again. It’s really frustrating. People are disillusioned” said Andrew Forkes-Gudmundson deputy director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans.

Deciding where a well can be drilled and all the associated equipment can go is important he added.

“There’s a new noise limit which is great. But it doesn’t really help the people who feel like these wells are being drilled right in their backyard” Forkes-Gudmundson said.

However applying the new rules on well locations retroactively to permits already approved would raise property rights issues he added. And the new setback rule allows for exceptions.

The 2019 law changed the mission of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. The COGCC went from balancing oil and gas development with protecting the public and environment to regulating the industry in a way that protects the public and the environment.

The COGCC and the state Air Quality Control Commission spent more than a year writing new rules and holding public hearings.

But the new rules don’t apply to the large well pads across the road from the Colliers Hill neighborhood in Erie. The sites with a total of 28 wells compressors tanks and other equipment were approved in 2017 and 2019 before the new rules took effect.

“I do think there’s an opportunity to at least learn from this experience” Forkes-Gudmundson said

Perhaps the COGCC could consider allowing changes to a permit when conditions on the ground change before wells are drilled he added.

When Sandra Duggan and Kelsey Barnholt bought their homes in Colliers Hill and moved in last year the field now an industrial site looked like open space with a great view of the mountains.

“I’m from Chicago. I was showing my friends a tour out my back door and they were going ‘Oh my god look at that view'” Barnholt said. “Now I’d be embarrassed to show them.”

Barnholt didn’t see her new home until she walked through it an hour before the closing. Duggan and her husband Eric drove from Seattle to see their house.

“The way the Colorado housing market is now we had 24 hours to place an offer on the house” Duggan said.

Occidental Petroleum is drilling the wells. Occidental spokeswoman Jennifer Brice said in an email that the company had hoped to complete the drilling fracking and other work to get the wells flowing in early 2020 but hit pause when the pandemic hit. A number of companies put work on hold when oil prices plummeted and demand tanked after business and travel slowed because of COVID-19 restrictions.

In the meantime Duggan and Barnholt moved in and more homes were built near the dormant well pads. Fracking and other work resumed in February followed by complaints about health issues and concerns about air quality because of emissions.

“The you-didn’t-do-the-research crowd will say ‘You weren’t informed’ ” Duggan said. “Unless you’re digging extremely thoroughly and know about the COGCC website and how to look up where oil pads are going to pop up next to your house there’s no way to find out.”

“Boatload of permits”

Before Senate Bill 181 was introduced in 2019 the number of proposed and approved permits for well sites and individual wells were piling up. The backlog grew into the thousands leading up to a 2018 vote on a ballot measure that would have required setting wells back at least 2500 feet from occupied buildings. Some local governments considered temporary freezes on new permits in the face of an anticipated rush to beat the potential new law.

The ballot measure failed. And there were more than 6000 permit applications on the books by the end of 2018. Lawmakers who wanted stronger oil and gas regulations quickly made it clear that they would pursue legislation.

“The industry in 2018 started to feel the threat of real action being taken at the COGCC and either by ballot box legislation or rulemaking. They applied for an absolute boatload of permits” said Forkes-Gudmundson.

The previous minimum setback was 500 feet from homes As with the new regulations companies could request exceptions to the setbacks under certain conditions. Separate permits are required for the location of the well site or pad and individual wells drilled on the site.

The industry fretted whether permits would be delayed while the new rules were drafted but proponents of tougher rules called for a hold on all permits until SB 181 was fully implemented. The COGCC paused approvals to draft interim guidelines intended to carry out the spirit of the new law while permanent regulations were developed.

Legislators said SB 181 was never intended as a moratorium on new drilling and defended the COGCC’s decision to approve permits before the new rules were finalized.

Jeff Robbins chairman of the state commission said there might be a perception that permits approved before the new rules kicked in “got through the process.”

“My perspective on that is that’s not the case” Robbins said. “It just gets back to what was the legislative mandate from (SB)181.”

Legislators didn’t want to see a moratorium on new oil and gas locations Robbins added. “Nor did they want to see them get a free pass and get approved.”

The state approved 336 permits for well-pad locations and 2713 permits for individual wells between May 19 2019 and Jan. 14 2021. Certain locations didn’t get the go-ahead and were put on hold Robbins said.

Wells on a northwest Adams County site were among those approved after the new rules were written but before they took effect in January. Area residents said it’s unfair that the wells will be closer to their homes than what’s allowed under the updated regulations. The well pad’s location was approved in 2018.

“But the drilling they put it off and put it off. Now there’s a new subdivision going in here called East Creek Farms that Thornton annexed” Christine Nyholm said. She and other members of the group Adams County Communities for Drilling Accountability Now are concerned the new homes will be closer than 2000 to the well pad.

The permits for the individual wells weren’t approved until November 2020. The operator Great Western Petroleum has said its plans include air-quality monitoring and measures to reduce noise odors and threats to nearby Big Dry Creek.

Nyholm believes that under the expanded powers granted by SB 181 to local governments to regulate oil and gas Adams County could make a good case to the state that the new stronger protections should prevail. The community group is suing the COGCC Great Western and Adams County to see that they do.

Unearthing a well

For a neighborhood in north Thornton it’s not a new well site that’s creating consternation. Great Western is reclaiming a well that was shut down and plugged by another company in 2005.

Area homeowners were surprised when they learned that the well which is underneath a neighborhood park and playground that is ringed by houses would be unearthed.

“This is heavily utilized especially during COVID. This is the place to go where it’s safe” said Stacy Lambright standing with neighbors in North Creek Farms Park a few weeks before the digging began.

Now the park is fenced off. Big trucks and other equipment have been on site. Walls were put up to block noise and a basketball court was dug up.

State regulations including ones approved under SB 181 require that older wells be brought up to the latest standards when new wells are being drilled within a certain radius. A Great Western well pad the one being contested by Adams County Communities for Drilling Accountability Now is about 1.35 miles away.

“With the new rules operators like Great Western are going in and reclaiming older wells to put cement into a greater depth” said company spokeswoman Susan Fakharzadeh. .

The concrete casing is meant to protect groundwater. Fakharzadeh said there were no problems with the well. The goal is to reclaim the area and rebuild the basketball court no later than June 14.

The neighborhood is an example of where homes were built ever closer to existing oil and gas wells. People complained of nosebleeds and other health problems when an underground line at another old well in the subdivision started leaking.

Forkes-Gudmundson said some cities and counties are exploring reverse setbacks which are restrictions on how close new homes and other buildings can be from an existing well site. He said one idea is to eventually allow the setback to shrink because the biggest impacts from oil and gas occur during initial preparations and production

The new oil and gas regulations allow for more input from neighboring governments when a city or county is considering oil and gas development. In the case of Colliers Hill the subdivision is in Erie but the well pads on the other side of the road are in Weld County. Homeowners said it’s not clear who they can appeal to when work at the site creates noise odors and in the case of recent work disturbance to the point that pictures on the walls rattled and shook.

Weld County and the COGCC officials said Occidental is complying with the regulations. Jason Maxey director of the Weld County oil and gas energy department said inspectors visit the site. He said the county has worked with Erie which reviewed one of the permits the company needed to access the site.

“It’s only the COGCC and Weld County that can enforce any of the regulations that were in place in 2019 when that permit was issued” said Christiaan van Woudenberg on the Erie Board of Trustees.

The board recently voted to contract with independent contractors to collect and analyze data on emissions coming from the well pads. Two hundred residents signed a petition asking for the monitoring after people complained of headaches dizziness and respiratory problems.

Van Woudenberg expressed frustration that communities often hear there is no recourse when residents complain about drilling in their neighborhood and have to pay for any additional testing and monitoring.

“The fact of the matter is that the path by which we got here was legal at every step of the way but that doesn’t make it right” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmluYW5jaWFsZXhwcmVzcy5jb20uYmQvaG9tZS9zb3liZWFuLW9pbC1wcmljZXMtdGljay11cC1pbi1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLW1hcmtldC0xNjIxNzM4MTgy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Soybean oil prices tick up in Bangladesh market,"Soybean oil the most-consumed cooking oil has witnessed a fresh price hike in the past week a major blow to already battered consumers amid coronavirus pandemic.

The prices of bottled soybean oil rose to Tk 144 a litre from Tk 140-141 set by the refiners on May 3 last.

Bottled soybean oil of Rupchanda brand a product of Bangladesh Edible Oil Ltd. (BOEL) was selling at Tk 144 a litre. Its two-litre jar costs Tk 286.

One litre bottle of Teer soybean oil a product of City Group has now a price tag of Tk 144.

Although few grocers have some bottles on their shelves with the old price tag of Tk 139-141 a litre they were selling those bottles at Tk 143-144.

Refiners however said they would review the rates again soon in consultation with the government in the wake of prices skyrocketing in the global market.

Market experts suggested lifting all kinds of taxes on crude edible oil imports for a certain period so as to provide some relief for consumers facing pandemic-related hardship.

Director of City Group Biswajit Saha told the FE on Friday that they started supplying bottles with a price tag of Tk 143-144 (maximum retail price) after Eid.

""The Bangladesh Vegetable Oil Refiners and Vanaspati Manufacturers Association (BVORVMA) has already sent a proposal to the Trade and Tariff Commission (BTTC) seeking to raise prices in line with the rising import costs"" he said.

He claimed that the production cost increased to above Tk 162 a litre in March-April when the global price of crude soybean oil crossed US$ 1480 a tonne.

""We will sit with the commerce ministry within a few days to discuss our proposal with a view to reviewing the prices"" he added.

Another refiner declining to be named said they have proposed revising upward the price of bottled soybean oil-Tk 156 a litre.

Riad Hossain an employee of Bismillah Store at West Dhanmondi in the city said oil companies started supplying soybean bottles with a price tag of Tk 144 a litre after Eid. And the production dates printed on the bottle labels are April 27 and 28 2021.

Before the Eid they had sold soybean oil at Tk 139-141 a litre he said.

According to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) soybean oil prices registered an increase of over 36 per cent in the past five months.

Refiners revised the prices as many as six times in the last four months said TCB.

Additional secretary at the commerce ministry Shafiqul Islam told the FE that the officials concerned will hold an internal meeting on Sunday to take stock of the rising edible oil prices.

Secretary of Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) Md Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan said the government should exempt crude soybean oil import from all kinds of taxes for a certain period as the global prices continue to surge.

At the same time TCB should also increase supply of more oil to its open market sale programme so that consumers get some relief amid pandemic-induced crisis he said.

""Also policies should be adopted to raise edible oil production in the country"" he said.

Bangladesh imports 2.2-2.6 million tonnes of edible oils a year including 0.7-0.8 million tonnes of soybean oil and 1.4-1.6 million tonnes of palm oil to meet more than 95 cent of local demand.

Wallen posted his latest lyrical endeavor on IGTV Video noting that he wrote the track with his mother in mind. He titled it “Thought You Should Know” and laid out how she has been a support system during his rocky moments.

“What’s goin’ on mama / Something’s just dawned on me/ I ain’t been home in some months / Been chasin’ songs and women / Making some bad decisions / God knows I’m drinking too much” Wallen sings while he plays his acoustic guitar.

He continues on asking her how things are going back at home and if she is doing well before revealing how her love has made such a solid impact in his life.

“I thought you should know that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me / must have finally made their way on through / I thought you should know that I really like this girl down in Jefferson City and turns out she’s a lot like you” he adds in the final chorus.

Several country music artists commented on the social media song debut with Dustin Lynch sending along a supportive “Hell yes” and Old Dominion calling it “Pretty awesome.” Miranda Lambert even dropped in on the video and revealed her hand in the song’s creation.

“Thanks for letting me and @nicatnitemusic write this special song with you. Sounds great” she wrote.

Wallen has been pretty quiet in the industry since a video of him using racist slurs surfaced back in February. He also caused quite a stir when he was cut from his original Saturday Night Live debut in October of 2020 after he was seen partying without social distancing or wearing a mask on social media videos. He was then asked back in December where he apologized and even poked fun at himself for his actions in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wallen has not confirmed whether or not he will release a studio version of “Thought You Should Know.”"

These shortages are a product of poor planning during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a production model that relies on global supply chains which are subject to interruption.

This situation has spurred governments across the world to action. Several Japan among them are providing support to chipmakers to increase production. While governments should work to ensure a steady supply of chips it is vitally important that any solution not create more problems. A cooperative multilateral approach is required.

In January global semiconductor industry sales rose 13.2% from a year ago reaching $40 billion. Nevertheless companies in almost every industrial sector continue to complain of shortages that prevent them from meeting production schedules.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5pc3RzLzIyMDUyMS9tYW5pc2gtdGV3YXJpLXdhci1vZi10aGUtY2hpcHMuaHRtbNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vYW1wL29waW5pb24vY29sdW1uaXN0cy8yMjA1MjEvbWFuaXNoLXRld2FyaS13YXItb2YtdGhlLWNoaXBzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manish Tewari | War of the chips,"One of the less analyzed reasons for the Chinese aggression in Eastern Ladakh since the April of 2020 is access to fresh water sources. Though there has been some discussion and dissection of this train of thinking in the rarefied echelons of strategic policy deliberations the issue has never really travelled into wider setting of public dialogues. It has something to do with semiconductors or the ubiquitous chip that powers our daily existence.

A chip or microchip is a semiconductor wafer usually manufactured from silicon that combines an assortment of electronic circuits incorporating resistors transistors capacitors and diodes that interlock to perform a required task. A single integrated circuit can comprise of thousands to millions of such electronic circuits contingent upon the computing power required.

Semiconductors rule the world today. Optimising and producing speedier thinner and more formidable semiconductors will be seminal in defining the outcome of numerous economic and geopolitical conflicts of our times. As it has been prophesized by Steve Bank the mentor of the Lean Start up movement “to get hold of the semiconductors may be the 21st century equivalent of getting hold of the oil supply in the 20th century”. This is the strategic resource that all emerging and great powers of the world are in a race to both secure and control.

The omnipotent and captivatingly nomenclatured Silicon Shield is what safeguards Taiwan. The Taiwan Semi Conductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the world’s largest third party chip manufacturer. It exercises dominance to the extent of 55 per cent if not more over the global market share insofar it pertains to the production of microchips. These semiconductors do not just power cellphones and laptops they are central to the functioning of virtually everything from automobiles to weapon systems.

The factum that TSMC produces the microchips that run the electronics of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II stealth multirole combat aircraft the latest jewel of the US Air Force is a sterling example of the extent of strategic importance of the both the resource and its supply chain. Were the semiconductor industry of Taiwan to collapse it would not only constitute a national security threat to the US but also for the entire hub and spoke security architecture crafted by the United States globally. That is how the Silicon Shield of Taiwan is in itself a weapon of deterrence for Taiwan especially against an ever expansionist China in the 21st century.

Both the US and China are trying to be autonomous when it comes to manufacturing of semiconductor chips. If the US were for some reason be deprived of access to the foundries of Taiwan the US defence and consumer electronics industries would be set back at least half a decade if not more.

As China is investing heavily in setting up its own chip foundries it could become the world leader in this technology in the next decade or so. That’s why one of the early decisions made by the Biden administration was an executive order promulgated in early 2021 to address both chip shortage and the gaps in its supply chain to the US. This deficiency is critical for the US as its global share in chip manufacturing stands at just 12 per cent. A large part of the US government’s sanctions against Huawei are singularly focussed on inhibiting the company’s access to the world’s most modern chip manufacturing technology — Taiwan’s TSMC.

China had the foresight that its initial success as the world’s low-cost factory was going to run its course and other countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh to name a few would soon occupy that space. As a result China needed to build more advanced and sophisticated products to be on par with the United States. However most of these products required custom chips — and China lacks the domestic manufacturing capability to produce them.

China uses 61 per cent of the world’s chips in products for both its domestic and export markets importing around $310 billion worth in 2018 alone. China was quick enough to appreciate that its incapacity to fabricate these sophisticated chips could well turn out to be the proverbial chink in its armour.

Beijing has always had mega motivations to build its own homegrown capacity. A total of 1.4 trillion dollars have been earmarked in the 2021 budget alone for the development of the semiconductor industry. By 2025 the objective being that 70 percent of chips used in China would be Made in China under the National Integrated Circuit Plan. Over 70 projects have been commenced utilising capital outlays in the past few years alone. Chinese semiconductor industry has gone from making zero to 16 per cent of the world’s chips.

But how does all of this mesh with the larger geopolitical conflicts between India and China? There is a growing realisation that the battle between the US and China to acquire leadership in semiconductor manufacturing is going to divide the world into microchip manufacturing haves and have not’s. That is where India fits into the Chinese plans. The semiconductor industry requires two key resources sand and freshwater. They are the basic raw materials. 10000 litres of fresh water is needed to manufacture one 30-cm silicon wafer.

China’s Achilles heel is this availability of fresh water. Key Chinese water systems like the Yangtze Huang Ho and Mekong rivers are full of effluents. That is how Kashmir Aksai Chin and Ladakh became crucial for China. The Taklamakan desert (located in Aksai Chin) not only provides abundant sand but huge reservoirs of fresh water from Himalayan rivers and glaciers. The Shaksgam valley alone is home to 242 glaciers that can serve as the grand reservoir of fresh water for Chinese chip manufacturing. It therefore becomes imperative to view the Sino-Indian standoff through this technological lens also.

From 2011 onwards the UPA government had made chip manufacturing a priority. In September 2013 two consortiums including IBM and ST Microelectronics had proposed building semiconductor wafer plants in India with an outlay of USD 8 billion. However the proposals died after the NDA/BJP government assumed office in 2014. Finally in the June of 2020 the government finally announced a Performance Linked Incentive for Promotion of Electronic Components and Semiconductors and Electronics Manufacturing Clusters. However as it is with the current dispensation it is always a case of too little too late.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1L21vb3Jlcy1sYXctY291bGQtZ2V0LWEtbmFub3RlY2gtYm9vc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moore's Law could get a nanotech boost,"If you’ve purchased a new computer lately like I have you may have noticed just how fast these new machines are.

And that is largely because computer chips keep getting better and better.

Back in 1965 an American engineer named Gordon Moore observed that the number of transistors on a computer chip was doubling about every 18–24 months.

His observation and follow-up prediction came to be known as Moore’s Law.

That rapid pace of miniaturization of transistors that make up computer processors and memory chips eventually would stall out at around the year 2000 as it bumped into basic physical limits.

Until a new development that allowed for a three-dimensional architecture of semiconductor devices on a chip broke the logjam in 2007 and rapid progress resumed.

But now scientists fear we on the edge of another semiconductor bottleneck — unless new radical approaches are found.

The answer according to a group of researchers could be the application of nanotechnology.

The latter is the use of matter on an atomic molecular and supramolecular scale for industrial purposes.

The ability to visualize and manipulate matter at the nanoscale has led to a diverse technology that ranges from better and faster electronics and more efficient fuel usage to sensing drug discovery and stronger more resistant materials.

Check out this description from AzoNano.com:

“A nanometre is one-billionth of a metre: ten times the diameter of a hydrogen atom. The diameter of a human hair is on average 80000 nanometres. At such scales the ordinary rules of physics and chemistry no longer apply. For instance materials’ characteristics such as their colour strength conductivity and reactivity can differ substantially between the nanoscale and the macro. Carbon ‘nanotubes’ are 100 times stronger than steel but six times lighter.”

Nanotechnology has the prospect of affecting the lives of all of us and already a number of applications are in the market-place.

Now researchers at MIT the University of California at Berkeley the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and elsewhere have found a new way of making those electrical connections which could help to unleash the potential of 2D materials and further the miniaturization of components — possibly enough to extend Moore’s Law at least for the near future the researchers say.

At the interface between the semimetal (bismuth) and the 2D semiconductor (MoS2) there is no energy barrier for the electron to go through leading to an ultralow contact resistance between them. Credit: MIT Research Team.

The findings are described in the journal Nature in a paper by recent MIT graduates Pin-Chun Shen PhD ’20 and Cong Su PhD ’20 postdoc Yuxuan Lin PhD ’19 MIT professors Jing Kong Tomas Palacios and Ju Li and 17 others at MIT UC Berkeley and other institutions.

According to a report in SciTechDaily the direction being explored is the use of atomically thin materials instead of silicon as the basis for new transistors — but connecting those “2D” materials to other conventional electronic components has proved difficult.

“We resolved one of the biggest problems in miniaturizing semiconductor devices the contact resistance between a metal electrode and a monolayer semiconductor material” says Su who is now at UC Berkeley.

The solution proved to be a simple one: the use of a semimetal the element bismuth to take the place of ordinary metals to connect with the monolayer material.

Such ultrathin monolayer materials in this case molybdenum disulfide are seen as a major contender for a way around the miniaturization limits now being encountered by silicon-based transistor technology.

But creating an efficient highly conductive interface between such materials and metal conductors in order to connect them to each other and to other devices and power sources was a challenge holding back progress toward such solutions Su says.

The interface between metals and semiconductor materials (including these monolayer semiconductors) produces a phenomenon called metal-induced gap state which leads to the formation of a Schottky barrier a phenomenon that inhibits the flow of charge carriers.

The use of a semimetal whose electronic properties fall between those of metals and semiconductors combined with proper energy alignment between the two materials turned out to eliminate the problem.

So-called two-dimensional materials thin sheets just one or a few atoms thick meet all the requirements for enabling a further leap in miniaturization of transistors potentially reducing by several times a key parameter called the channel length — from around 5 to 10 nanometers in current cutting-edge chips to a subnanometer scale.

A variety of such materials are being widely explored including a whole family of compounds known as transition metal dichalcogenides.

The issue of achieving a low-resistance metal contact with such materials has also been hampering basic research on the physics of these novel monolayer materials.

Because existing connection methods have such high resistance the tiny signals needed to monitor the behavior of electrons in the material are too weak to get through.

“There are numerous examples coming from the physics side that call for a low-contact resistance between the metal and a semiconductor. So it’s a huge problem in the physics world as well” Su says.

Figuring out how to scale up and integrate such systems at a commercial level could take some time and require further engineering. But for such physics applications the researchers say the impact of the new findings could be felt quickly.

“I think in physics many experiments can benefit from this technology immediately” Su says.

Nanoscale semiconductors also exhibit a widened band gap that provides these materials with a unique chemical stability at high operating temperatures.

This thermal stability provides a wide range of advantages to systems equipped with nanoscale semiconductors especially when compared to silicon-based devices.

For example electronic systems can eliminate the need for excess wires connectors or cooling systems that would previously have been needed.

Besides MIT and the University of California at Berkeley the team included researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company the National Taiwan University and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.

The work was supported by the National Science Foundation the US Army Research Office the Office of Naval research and the US Department of Energy.

A unique course for designing integrated semiconductor chips conceived and organized by Gayathri Singh team leader for Microelectronics at CMC Microsystems is a hot ticket with graduate students at Canadian universities. No other organization in Canada offers such a course based on the most advanced semiconductor chip processes in existence.

The May 10 to May 21 (2021) online event is fully subscribed with 30 university researchers and graduate students across Canada taking part.

Commenting on how she designed the course Dr. Singh said: “I wanted to base the content on leading edge semiconductor technology. It is exciting and gratifying to see the interest in the program. I am most grateful to our industrial partners who joined together to provide vital support to the program” she said.

Dr. Singh earned her Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from Queen’s University. She worked as Senior Component Design Engineer at Intel India at their Bangalore Design Center between 2005 and 2008. This advanced course trains students and researchers in the Analog-Mixed Signal Design Methodology using Cadence tools which target the GlobalFoundries GF12LP FinFET / PDK (Process Design Kit).

FinFET transistors are key components

The training content and material for the course was developed by Cadence Design Systems Canada Ltd. Skills learned are consistent with those of engineers designing chips at top flight technology companies in Canada including AMD Alphawave IP and StarIC.

Participants. must have had prior experience with semiconductor chip design and familiarity with state-of-the-art design tools. Participants which include CMC staff members learn about one of the most advanced semiconductor chip processes in North America. The FinFET transistors are key components right down to 2nm process nodes in development in the world’s most advanced fabrication facilities. Actual fabrication of the chip designs created by participants will be done through GlobalFoundries facilitated by CMC.

Skills learned contribute to the overall knowledge

Participants will be submitting design proposals in the fall of 2021 that will be reviewed by experts. Another workshop style session is planned for the winter next year before these designs are taped out so designers can consult with experts from Cadence companies and academe prior to submitting their designs for fabrication.

CMC Microsystems enables industry relevant technology research at 60 post-secondary institutions across Canada. CMC programs and services provide researchers with access and training throughout the integrated chip design life cycle from software design through actual manufacturing and testing of silicon chips. The skills learned in this course contribute to the overall knowledge and training of university graduates in semiconductor related technologies. The knowledge and skills are highly relevant and desirable to industry.

According to Marie Thiele director of common services for CMC the game plan is to open the program more widely in the future. “Our training platform is especially valuable in times of virtual training bringing together participants from across Canada suppliers from other countries and CMC employees onto our secure design tools and training” said Thiele.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RlY2gvU2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMvTWljcm9uLWNoYWxsZW5nZXMtU2Ftc3VuZy1zLWRvbWluYW5jZS1pbi1tZW1vcnktbWFya2V00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron challenges Samsung's dominance in memory market,"SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics' semiconductor business the engine that has powered the company's high profitability is coming under growing pressure. In the latest fiscal quarter the company was overtaken by rival Micron Technology in terms of operating profit margin for the sector with the former posting 18% and the latter reaching 20%. A drop in the profitability of the company's cash cow could also affect its investment capacity in other sectors such as semiconductor contract manufacturing and displays.

The decline in the semiconductor operation's profitability in the period from January to March stems largely from a plant shutdown in Texas after cold weather caused power outages in mid-February and the opportunity loss during this period led to a drop in earnings."

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Companies With The Most Cash Reserves In America.

The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the economy in a way that no one thought possible. Back when the economy of the United States crashed in 2008 - 2009 and the rest of the world followed suit few people thought they would face an even worse disaster in 202o just over a decade later. But that is what happened in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic which originated in China spread across the world leading to over 170 million cases as well more than 3.5 million deaths. These figures themselves are likely to be extremely understated and we will know the true impact of Covid-19 in the coming years.

As countries started imposing lockdowns to battle this virus for which they had no solution economies which are entirely dependent on lockdowns well not happening. Most industries faced significant losses as economies collapsed and most countries across the globe entered into either recessions or depressions. Many companies had to incur massive losses as well as major layoffs as demand for most industries fell and going at the same rate as pre-pandemic made no sense at all.

Even though as I mentioned most industries and companies suffered some actually came out of the pandemic smelling like roses. Take Tesla for example. The market cap of the company jumped astronomically during 2020 making even ordinary shareholders into millionaires and making Elon Musk the richest man in the world and the highest earning billionaire in 2020 as well as the richest man in the world for a while. Tech companies generally managed quite well in fact with many companies reporting higher sales and profits as demand for tech increased while more and more people continued to work from home.

Another example is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America. Apple Inc has nearly $200 billion in cash and marketable securities. One would think that with a large number of its stores closed Apple would have suffered dearly during the crisis. Fortunately for Apple Inc. (AAPL) shareholders the company did well during the past 12 months and AAPL shares performed even better. The company used some of its cash hoard to continue paying dividends and buy back shares. Apple Inc. should have used its massive cash hoard to snatch some EV and battery companies on the cheap.

15 companies with the most cash reserves in America

Another technology stock that is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America is Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook Inc carries more than $60 billion in cash on its books and despite this huge buffer Facebook shares declined all the way down to $140 in March 2020. Mr. Market misjudged Facebook's potential for a few days but investors had a change of heart after a few weeks and Facebook shares returned more than 120% since its March 2020 lows. Unfortunately Facebook Inc's management didn't put its huge cash hoard into good use and take advantage of the opportunities.

Most of the companies that made our list of the 15 companies with the highest cash reserves in America are tech companies but you can also find non-technology stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Ford (NYSE:F) on our list. Costco was one of the beneficiaries of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic but JP Morgan Chase and Ford shares suffered large losses despite their cash reserves.

It would make sense that tech companies have massive cash reserves. Due to the high value of shares of these companies as well as the fact that their products are generally highly priced with significant margins these companies tend to have a lot of surplus cash on hand. However having a lot of excess cash can also be often considered to be a failure on the part of the company to have the cash simply lying around when it could be put to better use say on investing activities or to pay off debts which would allow the company to save significant money on interest payments. On the other hand having too little cash can give the signal that the company has liquidity issues and can also be perceived negatively by investors and shareholders. Therefore there is a fine balance to maintain one which many companies are able to maintain while others are not.

However in the era of Covid where the economy needs significant boosts it is frustrating many people including Wall Street that companies are sitting on massive piles of cash and yet are refusing to utilize it. As I mentioned earlier companies can use it for investing activities as well as acquisitions or by returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends which would gain them goodwill in an unprecedented year. Another option is buyback of shares from shareholders though detractors argue that this is simply a short term boost for investors while resulting in a long term effect on the health of a company.

Of course the simple reason would be that this isn't the best time really to spend money. The market is uncertain the economy will take a while to recover and while there is optimism on the horizon with vaccines being administered it is still a long haul process and not an immediate one. Hence companies are a bit cautious in investing money. Further the biggest companies in the world are also really big on acquisitions with Apple acquiring a hundred companies over the last 6 months. That means an acquisition every three to four weeks. Furthermore tech companies famous for having a lot of cash on hand are also known for sitting on said cash. And even though this doesn't mean that these companies are not spending cash at all it's just that many analysts believe that these companies are not doing as much as they do.

Coming up with the list of companies with the largest cash reserves in America was not an easy task. Search on the internet and you'll generally find tech companies and even then those articles are often outdated. Most people want to know the reserves that companies have now one year after the Covid-19 pandemic rather than back in 2019 or 2018. Hence we selected the biggest companies from the Fortune Global 500 list and focused particularly on the tech industry as it is true that these companies tend to have the most cash. We have selected the latest quarterly reports for each company and scoured the balance sheet to find out the cash reserves that these companies own. Due to the high liquidity of marketable securities we have considered them among cash equivalents as well though most other types of investments including long term investments have not been considered. Together these companies hold more than $1.1 trillion in cash alone which is truly an astonishing amount. So without further ado let's take a look at the companies which combined have more cash than most countries in the world starting with number 15:

In the latest Around Town column stories on local Girl Scouts contributing to a book of letters to Vice President Kamala Harris a teen’s skateboard giveaway in East Palo Alto and an alleged dog beating in Palo Alto.

DEAR MADAM VICE PRESIDENT … We saw history made six months ago when Vice President Kamala Harris became the first female and person of color to rise to the nation’s second-highest office. The groundbreaking win resonated with countless women and girls including the 10 members of Palo Alto Girl Scout Troop 60313. The girls’ letters to Harris are among the more than 100 messages featured in a new book “Dear Kamala: Women Write to the New Vice President.”

Troop volunteer Kristen Podulka whose daughter is in the group initiated the letter-writing project in November. After some online research she came across a Facebook page with a call for letters to Harris for the book but the submission deadline had already passed. Podulka connected with Peggy Brooks-Bertram who compiled the book and accommodated the troop which submitted letters and photos within three days. Each girl received a copy of the book signed by Brooks-Bertram. The troop also donated a signed copy to their school Fairmeadow Elementary.

From climate change to racial discrimination the letters demonstrated their awareness of current events and systemic issues. As she reviewed the girls’ messages Podulka said she couldn’t help but feel “emotional” and “proud” of the young women. “These kids are very very hopeful for the future” she said.

The troop joined other contributors for a virtual book launch party in February where one of their members Eleanor Chow read from her letter. The 10-year-old described her desire to see everyone get an education and suggested ways to improve the environment. “We all care about women’s rights and having important women in history to think about and to talk about” Eleanor said of her troop.

THIS IS HOW SHE ROLLS … Cinthya Guzman‘s vision of donating skateboards to her peers in East Palo Alto became a reality on May 15 with the help of Thiebaut Method a nonprofit that works with middle school students on social good projects.

Sixty-two skateboards were donated to community members at an event on May 15 2021. East Palo Alto resident Cinthya Guzman organized the giveaway for her social good project with the nonprofit Thiebaut Method. Courtesy Paul Thiebaut Jr.

The eighth grader created flyers and distributed them to the community in an effort to gather skateboard decks helmets wheels hardware and monetary donations. Her donors included Skateworks Atlas Skates and Society Skates. Along the way she gained computer skills and confidence in presenting her project to people.

She also partnered with leaders such as East Palo Alto City Council member Antonio Lopez and helped other students apply for a skateboard. Rep. Jackie Speier D-San Mateo took notice of Cinthya’s project and sent her a congratulatory letter that recognized her “inventiveness and generosity.”

Cinthya’s three-month project culminated with a giveaway of 62 boards more than double her initial goal during an event last weekend at the skatepark near Bell Park and the YMCA.

A CALL FOR HELP … Palo Alto residents unleashed fury on the social networking site Nextdoor this month after a person at Mitchell Park witnessed a man allegedly beating a German shepherd-type dog in the dog-run area.

The man was observed striking the dog on the back as many as 20 times with a plastic-like leash or strap on April 30 at about 8:10 a.m. The dog all the while was screaming in pain according to the resident who posted an image. The man was not seen hitting the dog in the photo. He was talking to another man who had a German shepherd as well. The dog which is black has tan fur on its front legs up to the knees and tan rear legs.

The reporting party said she yelled at the man and then called Palo Alto police. Officers investigated but did not find the man or dog department spokesperson Lt. Con Maloney said. Residents remain determined to find and protect the dog. As of this week hundreds have posted comments on Nextdoor and some residents said they plan to meet with Palo Alto Mayor Tom DuBois later this week.

Palo Alto Animal Control officers and the Police Department are investigating the case. Anyone who has information about the incident or who sees the man and dog is asked to call Maloney at 650-329-2637.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvYml6YXJyby1iYW5raW5nLW1hbHdhcmUtdGFyZ2V0cy03MC1iYW5rcy1pbi1ldXJvcGUtYW5kLXNvdXRoLWFtZXJpY2Ev0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxlZXBpbmdjb21wdXRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9zZWN1cml0eS9iaXphcnJvLWJhbmtpbmctbWFsd2FyZS10YXJnZXRzLTcwLWJhbmtzLWluLWV1cm9wZS1hbmQtc291dGgtYW1lcmljYS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bizarro banking malware targets 70 banks in Europe and South America,"A banking trojan named Bizarro that originates from Brazil has crossed the borders and started to target customers of 70 banks in Europe and South America.

Once landed on a Windows system the malware can force users into entering banking credentials and uses social engineering to steal two-factor authentication codes.

The expansion

Bizarro is under constant development as its author keeps expanding the list of supporting banks and they modify it to improve anti-analysis protections.

Statistics from cybersecurity company Kaspersky shows that Bizarro’s targets are now customers of banks in Europe (Germany Spain Portugal France Italy) and South America (Chile Argentina Brazil).

The malware spreads through phishing emails that are typically disguised as official tax-related messages informing of outstanding obligations.

The download link in the message retrieves Bizarro as an MSI package. After being launched the malware downloads from hacked WordPress Amazon and Azure servers a ZIP archive with malicious components needed for the attack.

Bizarro functionality

After it starts Bizarro will terminate any existing sessions with online banking services by killing all browser processes. This forces the user to re-enter the bank account credentials allowing the malware to collect them.

The malware can also disable the auto-complete function in a web browser to capture login credentials when the victim types them manually.

Kaspersky researchers note that Bizarro’s core component is its backdoor functionality which supports over 100 commands most of them “used to display fake pop-up messages to users.”

The component becomes active only after the malware enumerates all windows to check for a connection to one of the supported banking sites.

Bizarro can receive the following types of commands from its command and control server:

fetch data about the victim and manage the connection status

allow control of the files on the hard drive

allow control of the mouse and keyboard

shut down restart or destroy the operating system and limit the functionality of Windows

log keystrokes

commands that enable social engineering attacks

The social engineering component

Using specific commands for the backdoor component Bizarro’s operators can trick users into providing the bank account login information by showing them message boxes or windows asking for login data or two-factor authentication codes.

Using specific commands for the backdoor component Bizarro’s operators can trick users into providing sensitive information by showing them custom message boxes or windows.

The messages vary from fake notifications requesting the details again or asking to enter a confirmation code to a bogus error informing that the system needs a restart to complete a security-related operation.

Another social engineering trick in Bizarro's hat is displaying JPEG images containing a target bank's logo and instructions for the victim.

Some of these messages may block access to the entire screen and hide the taskbar making it more difficult to start Task Manager.

Most of the images try to convince the victim that their system is compromised or needs an update or that security and performance components for the browser need to be installed.

The social engineering component expands to trick victims into installing on their phones a fraudulent banking app which enables the collection of credentials and sensitive codes from mobile devices.

Based on the commands supported by the trojan an attack scenario on a compromised computer starts with the victim accessing a banking website.

The keylogging function in the malware captures the account password and then fake messages are shown to collect the two-factor authentication code.

Cybercriminals can buy some time to prepare a fraudulent transaction by showing a fake alert from the bank that blocks access to the screen.

Kaspersky says that Bizarro is not the only banking trojan in South America that expands to Europe. Other malware has followed the same path recently namely Guildma (a.k.a. Astaroth) Amalvado Javali Melcoz and Grandoreiro. All of them were created developed and spread in Brazil and have expanded outside Latin America.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY25hLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1oYWNrZXJzLTQwLW1pbGxpb24tcmFuc29tLWN5YmVyYXR0YWNrLTIwMjEtNdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY25hLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1oYWNrZXJzLTQwLW1pbGxpb24tcmFuc29tLWN5YmVyYXR0YWNrLTIwMjEtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CNA Financial paid hackers $40 million in ransom after cyberattack,"Investors are pouring billions into cybersecurity startups.

CNA Financial reportedly paid hackers $40 million in March following a ransomware attack Bloomberg reported.

The report comes weeks after Colonial Pipeline paid its ransomware hackers $4.4 million.

Ransom costs from ransomware attacks have been increasing.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

CNA Financial one of the largest insurance companies in the US reportedly paid hackers $40 million after a ransomware attack blocked access to the company's network and stole its data according to a report from Bloomberg's Kartikay Mehrotra and William Turton.

CNA first announced the hack in late March stating that it had seen a ""sophisticated cybersecurity attack"" on March 21 that had ""impacted certain CNA systems."" To address the incident the company called in outside experts and law enforcement both of which launched an investigation into the attack.

But behind closed doors about a week following the ransomware attack CNA began negotiating with the hackers Bloomberg reported.

The hackers initially demanded $60 million in ransom. But following negotiations CNA paid them $40 million in late March which could be one of the largest ransomware hacker payments yet.

Bloomberg's report on CNA Financial's ransom payment comes just weeks after Colonial Pipeline – the US' biggest refined products pipeline – paid hackers $4.4 million following its own cyberattack which had caused gas shortages across the East Coast.

Colonial Pipeline's payout may be notably lower than CNA Financial's but the cost of ransomware attacks have been increasing. In 2020 the average ransomware payment increased 171% from $115123 in 2019 to $312493 in 2020 according to a report from cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. And earlier this year both Quanta an Apple supplier and Acer were targeted by ransomware group REvil which demanded $50 million from both companies.

However the FBI advises against paying a ransom and says doing so could instead encourage more hacks.

According to a May 12 update from CNA ""systems of record claims systems or underwriting systems where the majority of policyholder data is stored"" were not affected by the cyberattack.

A CNA spokesperson told Insider that the company isn't commenting on the ransom but that it had ""followed all laws regulations and published guidance including OFAC's 2020 ransomware guidance in its handling of this matter.""

The spokesperson also noted that a group called ""Phoenix"" was behind the attack. The ransomware used on CNA is known as Phoenix Locker a spin-off of another malware ""Hades"" created by Russian hacking organization Evil Corp Bloomberg reported.

The US Treasury Department last sanctioned Evil Corp in 2019 following the group's distribution of another malware. This sanction barred Americans from paying an Evil Corp ransom. However the CNA spokesperson noted that Phoenix ""isn't on any prohibited party list and is not a sanctioned entity.""

The market responded positively to the impressive jobs data. The S&P 500 index recovered from the mid-week sell-off and opened Friday’s session up 25 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced back and crossed the 34000 mark once again but remained below the recent peak.

Putting an end to speculation AT&T and WarnerMedia signed a $43-billion pact to combine the latter’s entertainment and sports assets with the global leisure business of Discovery in one of the largest deals in recent times that would create a new company.

In another tech deal the cloud communications platform Twilio agreed to acquire Seattle-based messaging app Zipwhip for about $850 million. Continuing its acquisition spree professional services firm Accenture bought management consultancy Homburg & Partner. The latest to join the M&A bandwagon was Snap which is buying AR display maker WaveOptics for more than $500 million.

The year 2020 has been regarded as the worst year to date for ransomware attacks (according to the US Justice Department)  with most people working from home and the pandemic bringing all of us online.

However while today ransomware attacks occur through files or emails that you download the first-ever ransomware attack was actually distributed on 5.25-inch floppy disks.



Ransomware on a floppy disk

The infected floppy disks were distributed to the mail attendees of the World Health Organisation AIDS conference in Stockholm in 1989 according to a report by the Atlantic. The disk claimed to be a computer-based questionnaire to help determine the risk of a patient contracting AIDS and managed to distribute 20000 copies in 90 nations.

A few days after the floppy disk was inserted (mostly after 89 times a PC was booted) the computers locked up with a red screen. The message appearing on their screens demanded them to send $189 in an envelope to a PO box in Panama.

The virus locked the contents of the victims’ computers and would unlock them only in return for a “licensing fee.” It encrypted the filenames rendering most computers unusable. Security researchers however soon shared antidotes to unlock the systems from the virus.



The ransomware creator was soon caught

The creator of this virus Joseph Popp an evolutionary biologist by profession (who was conducting AIDS research at the time) was soon apprehended and charged with multiple counts of blackmail. To this day he is regarded as the inventor of ransomware.

When arrested he allegedly claimed in court that he was going to use the money to donate to AIDS research. However another Guardian report highlighted that this aggressive move was a reaction to being rejected for a job opportunity with WHO.

The move comes after the company received a fair amount of backlash from both viewers and advertisers in the wake of the new trend on the platform.

Now those who stream via their hot tub will be put under the category “Pools Hot Tubs and Beaches” so it is clear to everyone. This decision also allows those advertising on the platform to designate if they want ads there or not.

Just a few days before the new designation the company took a number of ads off of those who fit into the hot tub streaming category. There was no warning about the decision and the company has since declared that a mistake on their end.

Twitch has had a long history of bias the company’s reaction to channels that stream sexual content are hard to ignore when other channels are suspended or banned for less.

A Twitch representative followed up by saying “We did not alert impacted creators at the time and we should have–our creators rely on us” and the company is now attempting to “restore ads where appropriate.”

One of the larger streamers on the platform Amouranth was hit with the ad suspension. Currently however her channel is back to showing ads with the hot tub streams no longer available to access.

In addition the company says that this does not mean it will change any of its current policies. There is no ban on hosting a stream in clothing that fits into a specific context such as a bathing suit at a beach.

The streaming giant elaborated further on this non- change in policy “Being found to be sexy by others is not against our rules and Twitch will not take enforcement action against women or anyone on our service for their perceived attractiveness.”

Of course these streamers in question are usually women who can often be subjected to sexual harassment from those on the platform. It is certainly one way to gain eyeballs but it does have risks for this very reason. The company hopes to minimize this form of harassment in the future.

Twitch also maintains that the new category is more of a short-term solution for advertisers and plans to implement further actions as part of more of a long-term strategy. The key for now is letting these advertisers opt out of having their ads on the more risque content.

Whether or not this will mean less of the trending hot tub streamers from popping up is uncertain. Now that the videos are not quite as front and center might make the appeal of wearing a bathing suit less appetizing for streamers.

Finally If there are fewer advertisers willing to have their ads placed in these streams there will be less revenue overall in the category and perhaps a decrease in the recent trend.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The buy now pay later trend has picked up steam in the past year or so and Affirm (AFRM 10.23%) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries. In this Fool Live video clip recorded on May 3 Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel CFP and Industry Focus host Jason Moser discuss whether Affirm is worth a look or if one of the fintech giants like PayPal (PYPL 1.00%) or Square (SQ 2.90%) might be a better way to invest.

10 stocks we like better than Affirm Holdings Inc.

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Affirm Holdings Inc. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of May 11 2021

Matt Frankel: Jen says ""If you had to pick one Square or PayPal and why? Also couldn't either or both of these companies do what Affirm is doing?"" We'll take them one at a time. Yes they can absolutely do what Affirm is doing. In fact PayPal is doing what Affirm is doing. PayPal has its own buy now pay later service right now that's really the biggest bear case against Affirm right now is that all these big fintech's could do the same thing they're doing in some cases use their tens of millions of loyal customers to build a following with it. If I had to pick one right now I would have to go with Square just because I see them as the biggest opportunity from here. I think that they have a lot of room to grow their business still whereas PayPal is not necessarily maxed out but they're definitely more of the mature company of the two. Payment volume through PayPal was roughly 10 times what it is through Square's network. Square has a lot more adjacent opportunities especially on the consumer side of it. Especially now they're a bank remember Square just got a banking charter. I just see them as a higher potential of the two right now I don't think you'll go wrong with either one. I do like that PayPal got into Affirm space with the buy now pay later service. I think there's quite a bit of potential there as well. But out of the two I will pick Square if I was well I already owned Square but if I was adding today.

Jason Moser: This goes into the next question from Dev who asks ""Affirm versus Afterpay? Affirm is a Fool recommendation please give us your opinion. I mean the thing that's always concerned me about these businesses. I'm not saying that they are bad investments don't get me wrong. The question that I have though that keeps me on the sidelines is it reminds me a lot of the whole Clubhouse with Twitter spaces thing in like Clubhouse is a feature versus like a platform. Remember when live streaming video came out and like the big deal was Meerkat and it was at South by Southwest I guess. I think were talking about how Meerkat is this big deal and whatever. Then Twitter (TWTR) goes and buys Periscope and just basically just puts Meerkat out of business they had to completely redo everything. It was like this feature had a really difficult time then competing with platforms that could just introduced that feature. You've got a lot of platforms out there that are able to introduce that buy now pay later feature no problem. I mean we're watching them do it. Then I don't know does that make something like an Affirm weren't after pay a good investment? Is that something that investors should be concerned about? For me personally I look at those companies and think well they better come up with something else because what they're doing is being incorporated into other platforms. I don't know it's not like they have some irreplicable product or service that they're offering because other platforms other bigger networks are already replicating it.

Frankel: Right now Affirm's big advantage is that they have some big accounts specifically Peloton (PTON 13.20%).

Moser: Yeah Peloton. It's right

Frankel: If they were to lose Peloton that's a pretty big risk having a lot of your revenue come from one source. If they were to lose Peloton I would know what the bull case would be for Affirm right now. That's just me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN255LmNvbS9mYWtlLWludm9pY2VzLXNjYW0taW52b2ljZS1zY2Ftcy1wYXlwYWwvMTA2ODYzODgv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3bnkuY29tL2FtcC9mYWtlLWludm9pY2VzLXNjYW0taW52b2ljZS1zY2Ftcy1wYXlwYWwvMTA2ODYzODgv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 On Your Side: How to spot fake invoices from scammers,"How to spot fake invoices from scammers

NEW YORK (WABC) -- There's now a warning about clicking on invoice attachments from companies you do business with.

Scammers are using a lot of popular sites that many of us use to get to you and your wallet.

Fake invoice scams have been around for years. But now they're getting a cyber-facelift.

They're getting more popular targeting small businesses and consumers using platforms like PayPal.

They're even spoofing consumer watchdogs like the Better Business Bureau in an effort to bilk bucks from you.

The bills look legit a PayPal invoice seemingly from the World Health Organization asking you to pony up $35.

In February automated telemarketing phone calls spiked hitting 4.6 billion nationwide. But 7 On Your Side has just the ticket to stop the spoofs.

And a spoofed bill from Amazon states it shipped your TV hoping you'll start paying on a whopping $2500.

Only problem is they're both fake. They are bogus invoices generated by cyber crooks all to separate you from your personal information or money.

First type of fake invoice scam is the click bait. The email seemingly has an invoice attached. But when you click on it malware is downloaded onto your system and this can lead to ID theft.

The next example is simple a phony bill from a legit organization. Watch for bad spelling and grammar one 7 On Your Side found had two typos.

The big takeaway is to beware of high pressure tactics emails warning you to pay up or else that's a big tip off of a scam.

Don't click on attachments unless you're 100% sure the email is legit.

And verify before paying anything.

At just seven years of age Jude and his family were dealt the devastating news that he had leukaemia a form of blood cancer. The young Leeds United fan was undergoing a second round of treatment at Sheffield Children’s Hospital during the virtual mascot experience after being invited by club captain Liam Cooper who had grown close with the family through his very own LC6 Academy.

Jude was due to begin football training with the LC6 Academy in 2020 but due to his diagnosis in February he was unable to do so and if there is one thing that Jude loves more than anything else it is football and Leeds United.

Following the experience a family friend Dan Fenwick wrote a book about Jude which tells a tale of him playing for his favourite team Leeds United and leading them to winning the FA Cup. All funds raised from the sales of the book will be donated to Sheffield Children’s Hospital the place that helped Jude to battle against his cancer diagnosis.

This is a children’s story but the deeper meaning is that it is all about Jude and his journey with the youngster going through more than most at such a young age and overcoming Leukaemia.

The author Dan Fenwick said: “I am so happy that I have been able to create this piece of work about this remarkable young man and his horrible battle with cancer.

“I have known Jude for quite a few years now and he has always been a great lad! It was a privilege that the family allowed me to create this to raise money for charity. The support from Leeds United and their fans has been incredible.”

The book is now available to buy via the friends and family/personal option on PayPal at the following link: https://www.paypal.me/bookforjude. The book is priced at just £7 and when you are paying on PayPal please include your delivery details in the notes section."

Richard Montañez 62 began working as a janitor for Frito Lay - a company owned by PepsiCo - back in 1976. He has long claimed that he pitched the idea for the Flamin' Hot Cheetos flavor by boldly calling up company execs in 1990.

Since that time Montañez- a Mexican-American who was raised in a California migrant camp - has become revered as an immigrant success story. He went on to become vice president of multicultural sales & community promotions for PepsiCo and spent four decades at the company.

He has additionally written a best-selling book about his remarkable tale and he commands up to $50000 for motivational speeches which include regular references what he claims is his role in creating the cult spicy chip. A biopic of his life Flamin' Hot is currently in the works and is set to be directed by Eva Longoria.

But last week a bombshell report from The Los Angeles Times alleged that Montañez had made up most of his story. The paper spoke with multiple sources who disputed that the former janitor invented the popular product.

Frito Lay is quoted in the report as saying: 'None of our records show that Montañez was involved in any capacity in the Flamin' Hot test market.

'We have interviewed multiple personnel who were involved in the test market and all of them indicate that he was not involved in any capacity... The facts do not support the urban legend.'

Montañez subsequently spoke with Variety saying he was disappointed that Frito Lay publicly doubted his story.

'I was their greatest ambassador' he stated. 'But I will say this you're going to love your company more than they will ever love you keep that in perspective.

However on Friday Frito Lay's parent company PepsiCo released a new statement praising Montañez for his contribution to their business - while not disputing their earlier claim that he hadn't been involved in creating Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

'A great deal has been recently discussed about the origin of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. The information we shared with the media has been misconstrued by some which resulted in confusion around where we stand a range of emotions among our employees and consumers and a strain on our valued friendship with Richard Montañez and the Latino community' the statement read.

PepsiCo have released a statement in support of a former janitor Richard Montañez who claimed he invented their Flamin' Hot Cheetos flavor - just days after they said he was not at all involved in the creation of the product. He is pictured in 2017

Montañez- a Mexican-American who was raised in a California migrant camp - has become revered as an immigrant success story. A second book about his rags-to-riches tale is set to be released next month (poctured)

'Far from being an urban legend Montañez had a remarkable 40-plus-year career at PepsiCo and made an incredible impact on our business and employees and continues to serve as an inspiration today' the statement continued.

'His insights and ideas on how to better serve Hispanic consumers were invaluable and directly resulted in the success of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. To be clear we have no reason to doubt the stories he shares about taking the initiative to create new product ideas for the Cheetos brand and pitching them to past PepsiCo leaders.'

The statement additionally claimed that there were 'different work streams tackling the same product without interacting' and that Montañez may possibly have had some part in the invention of Flamin' Hot Cheetos without their awareness.

Eva Longoria and others involved in Montañez's biopic are similarly standing by him without being able to verify whether or not he actually invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

The film's screenwriter Lewis Colick told Variety that 'enough' of the story seems true.

'We're not in the documentary business' he stated defending his film project.

Longoria also retweeted a post from a Latino civil rights advocate which stated: 'A big thank you to @PepsiCo for their strong statement on how our friend Richard Montañez' inspired influenced and invigorated the company for more than four decades. Our stories matter and Richard's is a special one. #FlaminHotFacts'.

However the LA Times are doubling down on their initial report.

'Frito Lay parent PepsiCo has a new statement responding to our story about the origins of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. It affirms our reporting' the paper's deputy business editor Jeff Bercovici tweeted.

The original LA Times story - titled 'The man who didn't invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos' - was published last weekend with the paper speaking with former colleagues and executives at Frito Lay who called into question Montañez's story.

In particular one woman Lynne Greenfeld said that she was put in charge of developing the brand and came up with the Flamin' Hot name and product idea.

'It is disappointing that 20 years later someone who played no role in this project would begin to claim our experience as his own and then personally profit from it' she told the paper.

Flamin' Hot - the biopic of Montañez's rags-to-riches tale - is currently in the works and is set to be directed by Eva Longoria

Montañez subsequently spoke with Variety saying he was disappointed that Frito Lay publicly doubted his story

Montañez has claimed that as a janitor he rang the chief executive and pitched the idea for Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

Yet Frito Lay said its records show he was not a janitor when Flamin' Hot was born. He had been promoted to machinist operator by October 1977 shortly after his hiring.

Greenfeld joined the company in 1989 and was tasked with finding a product that appealed to spicier tastes and could rival the flavor-filled snacks that were selling well in the mid West.

Six of the former employees remember inspiration coming from the corner stores of Chicago and Detroit - not from California where Montañez worked.

Fred Lindsay a salesman for the Chicago region remembers clearly working to develop the snack.

'The funny thing is I heard maybe a year ago that some guy from California was taking credit for developing hot Cheetos which is crazy' Lindsay told The LA Times.

'I'm not trying to take credit; I'm just trying to set the record straight.'

By August 1990 test versions of Flamin' Hot were launched in Chicago Detroit and Houston in response to local spicy chip brands that Frito Lay workers noticed would fly off shelves. By early 1992 they were on sale nationwide.

Montañez's version of events does not fit the timeline.

Montañez's tale is that he felt empowered to invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos after watching a motivational video from Roger Enrico the CEO of the company that encouraged all Frito-Lay workers to 'act like owners' and take charge of the business.

Yet Enrico did not start work until the beginning of 1991 - by which point the product had already been invented and tested.

Montañez claims that he called Enrico to pitch the idea and that Enrico flew out to Rancho Cucamonga California weeks later to witness his pitch in person.

Enrico died in June 2016 aged 71 in a snorkeling accident in the Cayman Islands.

Al Carey the only senior executive to support Montañez's version of events conceded that there were issues with some details and said that Enrico was not in attendance at the infamous meeting.

'Of course stories grow and the longer we get away from the date the stories evolve' Carey said.

But he insisted Montañez did invent Flamin' Hot.

'I'll bet Richard's added a little flavor to it' Carey said.

'The product that we know today as Flamin' Hot Cheetos was definitely not out in the market' before his meeting with Montañez Carey said.

'That product was developed by those guys in the plant.'

While Frito Lay said Montañez was not involved in the creation of the Flamin' Hot parent company PepsiCo are now defending him

Yet the LA Times spoke with 20 people who worked at the Frito Lay divisions responsible for new product development 32 years ago and none recall Montañez's meeting with Enrico and coming up with the mega-selling product.

'If that story existed believe me we would have heard about it' said Ken Lukaska who worked as a product manager for the core Cheetos brand when Flamin' Hots were rolling out nationally.

'This guy should run for office if he's that good at fooling everyone.'

Montañez certainly played a role in marketing for the company and enjoyed an impressive professional trajectory that ultimately saw him become a director at the brand.

Montañez began telling his Flamin' Hot story in the early 2000s and retired in 2019

Roberto Siewczynski worked on the Sabrositas test market in 1994 as an outside consultant and remembers Montañez being deeply involved in the process.

He said Sabrositas' marketing campaign aligns with what Montañez describes in his memoir for Flamin' Hot and concludes that the two stories became intertwined.

'I did go to Rancho Cucamonga' said Siewczynski.

He told The LA Times he was surprised to learn that the Sabrositas project was being led by production and distribution workers not the marketing department as a community-driven campaign focused on the Latino market in Los Angeles.

'It was 'Hey the plant really wants to do this; Richard really wants to do this' and they cut out a lot of the traditional management.'

Montañez began telling his story in the early 2000s and Greenfeld heard of it in 2018.

She was asked by the company's lawyers about the Flamin' Hot name and told them she definitively came up with it herself.

In 2019 when Longoria's film was in early discussion Frito Lay got in touch with the production company to warn them Montañez's story was not quite as it seemed.

Longoria is proceeding with the film however and casting has been completed.

Frito-Lay has made conflicting statements about the origins of Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

Parent company PepsiCo credits former exec Richard Montañez as one of the people involved.

But Frito-Lay told the LA Times they cannot find evidence of Montañez's work.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The humble origins of Frito-Lay's Flamin' Hot Cheetos could be a lie.

Richard Montañez a motivational speaker credits himself as the creator of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Montañez has crafted a career built upon the story of how he came up with the idea as a janitor at a California Frito-Lay plant in 1976 after immigrating to the US from Mexico.

Montañez has said in interviews that he put chili powder on a Cheeto and told the CEO of Frito-Lay his idea. The product has since become a one of America's favorite snacks and CNBC reported Montañez eventually became an executive at PepsiCo the parent company of Frito-Lay. Actress Eva Longoria is directing a movie based on Richard Montañez's story.

A post shared by Richard Montanez (@hotcheetosrpm)

But a new Los Angeles Times report claims Montañez did not invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos according to employees at Frito-Lay and refutes claims made by Montañez.

Lynne Greenfeld who was a junior snack food professional at Frito-Lay said she came up with the name ""Flamin' Hot Cheetos"" and created the product beginning in 1989 per the LA Times. The product entered test markets in Chicago Detroit Cleveland and Houston starting in 1990.

Employees at Frito-Lay said they could not recall Montañez meeting with company executives to pitch his idea. The LA Times also notes Roger Enrico – the former CEO of Frito-Lay who Montañez claims to have pitched Flamin' Hot Cheetos to – did not start as chief executive until six months after the products reached test markets.

Frito-Lay which the LA Times said never publicly refuted Montañez's claims until recently told the paper Montañez was not involved in any part of the Flamin' Hot Cheetos development.

But Frito-Lay did not deny Montañez's involvement in creating Flamin' Hot Cheetos to NPR which ran an episode on the product shortly before LA Times story published.

""He was a part of it. Yes. Sure"" a Frito-Lay spokesperson told NPR's Sarah Aida Gonzalez. Frito-Lay confirmed the existence of a meeting between Montañez and two company executives in California to NPR but later walked back their claim after ""additional facts were brought to light"" Gonzalez said in a tweet.







-Sarah Aida Gonzalez (@GonzalezSarahA) May 17 2021

Montañez has stood by his story and said Frito-Lay does not have documentation of his involvement because he was a janitor.

""Nobody was telling me 'This is how executives work.' I wasn't a supervisor I was the least of the least"" Montañez told Variety. ""I think that might be one of the reasons why they don't have any documentation on me. Why would they?""

In a May 21 statement to Latin Heat PepsiCo said they credit the launch and success of Flamin' Hot Cheetos in part to Richard Montañez.

""Richard is an important part of PepsiCo's history and the success of the company"" the company said. ""We regret the confusion that has come from the recent speculation but most importantly we want Richard to know he is valued and cared for among PepsiCo's employees and we only wish him happiness and success.""

Pulpex is a joint venture between Diageo (which owns brands like Johnnie Walker Smirnoff and Guinness) and Pilot Lite (a venture management company). Last year Diageo announced a cardboard bottle for its Johnnie Walker brand as early as 2021. With this in mind the two companies are focusing on developing a high-speed production line which is expected to be operational in 2022.

To produce these bottles and containers Stora Enso uses sustainably sourced formed fibre product manufactured by pressing various wood-based pulps into a three-dimensional shape in a moulding machine.

By using Stora Enso formed fibre material Pulpex will produce paper bottles for various global brands including homecare and personal care products to liquid foods alcohol and non-alcohol beverages.

Such fibre-based bottles and containers would enable a significantly lower carbon footprint of packaging compared with glass or PET. The customizable Pulpex bottle allows for embossing colouring and labelling to fit brand needs.

“This cooperation marks an important step in bringing to market a truly sustainable alternative to plastic bottles and containers while offering end-user qualities that match those of traditional packaging” explains Sohrab Kazemahvazi SVP Formed Fiber at Stora Enso.

In addition to Diageo Unilever Pepsico GSK Consumer Healthcare and Castrol have also joined Pulpex in a global consortium. Each company is committed to using Pulpex technology for its brands with the goal of producing 750 million paper bottles each year.

Unlike Ecologic Brands’ bottles - recently acquired by Jabil Inc. - or classic TetraPack bricks bottles designed by Pulpex can enter paper recycling streams directly without the need to separate their different components.

In recent years other consumer goods and packaging companies have tackled the challenge of creating paper-based bottles with the aim to reduce plastic consumption.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3R0aXNoZmFybWVyLmNvLnVrL2FyYWJsZS8xOTMxNzMwOS5hcmFibGUtcmVnZW5lcmF0aXZlLWZhcm1pbmctLS1ncm91bmRicmVha2luZy1ncmVlbndhc2hpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arable: Regenerative farming – groundbreaking or greenwashing?,"I ask because I can’t decide myself whether it’s a new and exciting paradigm-shifting approach to the way we run our businesses or if it’s nothing more than an up-cycling of some traditional practices by companies and organisations keen to give themselves a fresh coat of 'greenwash'.

Like a lot of things I guess the movement first began in the US – and it only seems to be a few years ago the term ‘regenerative agriculture’ first began to hit the headlines.

But over the course of those few years these practices now find themselves being widely touted as offering the solution not only to climate change but also to pretty much everything which is currently wrong with agriculture.

If you would believe some of its more vociferous adherents regenerative practices have the power to restore the balance between human beings and nature offering a solution big enough to pull our beleaguered planet back from the precipice upon which it is currently precariously perched.

It is an area which harbours strong opinions. Some are buying into the idea while others remain sceptical of some of its claims – and it an area which can provoke heated debate. While it seemed to have its origins in a grass roots movement the raising of its profile has been suspiciously precipitous in recent years.

For this movement has been well and truly thrust into the lime-light by everyone from small-scale farmers all the way through large-scale agribusiness and the practice has even become the latest marketing buzzword in the corporate world too with companies like McDonald’s Pepsico and even a number of leading clothing manufacturers all getting caught up in the scramble to pledge that they will source their goods from farms adopting regenerative practices.

But despite this meteoric rise to consumer consciousness there seems to be one little problem lying at the heart of this growing movement.

That is the fact that – certainly as far as I can ascertain – there is no certification body to oversee adherence to the practice; no widely accepted and recognised set of standards; and hence no way of auditing compliance by anyone claiming to be adopting the approach.

So with innumerable newspaper and magazine articles books documentaries and even a Netflix film on the subject it’s more than a little surprising that this slight issue hasn’t been raised.

Now it can’t be denied that some aspect of the approach probably have the makings of a promising idea. Those touting the system claim that agricultural land can help tie up carbon deep under the ground offsetting the disastrous climate effects of burning fossil fuels – and that potential promise is a central part of its appeal.

This is leading some of its proponents to claims that it’s wrong to settle for sustainability when the practices they preach go one step further and redress the environmental damage meted out by humanity.

Min-till and no-till drilling are seen as 'regenerative' farm practices but are some other measures not just 'teaching your granny how to sook eggs'?

But I stumbled upon a recent research paper which looked at how regenerative agriculture was defined across several hundred academic journal articles and dozens of websites devoted to the practice.

They found that only half of research articles that used the term supplied any sort of definition and while organisations promoting the approach were more likely to do this the details varied dramatically.

Most but not all of the sources surveyed said that 'regenerative' was about improving soil health or sequestering carbon – but there was no widespread agreement on how this should be done.

For some the term meant using no-till practices or planting cover crops. For others it was about integrating livestock with crop production or even improving animal welfare practices.

The study found that for yet another 'branch' it was about improving human health or food access or food safety.

While some said it was about supporting small-scale systems others said the focus should be on improving the social and economic well-being of communities regardless of farm size.

Some said it was about improving yields some said it was about increasing profit while others focused on the environmental benefits.

But maybe we should cut them some slack here because it took the organic movement decades to come up with an accepted set of standards and even with that there are points of contention which remain between some of the different schemes in different parts of the world.

While there might be no overseeing body for regenerative agriculture as noted above there seems to be some broad agreement around the areas of making use of cover crops reducing tillage integrating livestock and their manures into arable systems and making use of crop rotations. All of this has a focus on looking after soil health.

Of course it can’t be ignored that these principles have a fair old similarity with a lot of traditional practices. I think that’s what rankles me just a wee bit with the regenerative movement – it seems to be laying claim to a series of traditional practices many of which are still alive and well in various parts of the world including mixed farming in Scotland – and repackaging them as something new.

The worst of it is that we’ve largely been encouraged or forced through simple economics to move away from these sustainable practices by the urgings of advisors consultants and the big companies involved in manufacturing fertilisers and sprays. And that's all in order to meet the needs of the increasingly multi-national food groups and supermarkets – the self-same set of groups which are now trying to sell them back to us!

One of the big food groups which has publicly nailed its colours to the regenerative agriculture mast is Pepsico. It recently announced that it will spread the adoption of these practices across 7m acres – which is approximately equal to PepsiCo’s entire agricultural footprint. It estimated the effort will eliminate at least 3m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade.

As well as producing cola Pepsico also own Walkers crisps and Quaker Oats the latter of which we supplied for a number of years.

I asked David Wilkinson the company’s senior director of European agriculture how compliance with regenerative practices would be audited and if there was a certification body or an accepted and recognised set of standards for regenerative farming he replied: “There isn’t currently such a body however we are advocating for the establishment of industry-wide regenerative agriculture standards and measurement.

“In the absence of such standards we will measure progress towards the 'Positive Agriculture' goals by tracking acres and people engaged in the initiative and over time the impact toward outcomes including: building soil health and fertility; sequestering carbon and reducing emissions; enhancing watershed health; increasing biodiversity; and improving farmer livelihoods.”

He recognised that farming was a ‘hyper-local’ business and that crops were grown in different ways in different countries – and that allowances need to be made for that:

“This presents an exciting challenge to work with farmers to design bespoke solutions which will work for their businesses. We’re exploring how we create the toolboxes and capabilities to build knowledge with all our farmers sharing that through a virtual farmer network and then helping them choose what works in practice for them” said Wilkinson.

He added that the company was also engaged with leading organisations like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to develop a method for setting science-based targets for water that considered the benefits of regenerative and resilient farming systems and practices on water quality and water quantity.

So who knows the regenerative movement might be onto something – but like a lot of practices which suddenly find themselves the centre of attention it needs to make sure that it gets its core principles sorted out and doesn’t make the mistake of being swallowed up by its own publicity.",,,

With little fanfare the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave Pfizer permission this week to store its COVID-19 vaccine in a typical refrigerator for one month -- freeing the vaccine from the need to be shipped in cumbersome boxes stuffed with dry ice.

Among authorized COVID-19 vaccines Pfizer's vaccine was notorious for its ultra-cold storage requirements. Now as the only vaccine authorized for children ages 12 to 17 this new flexibility could dramatically accelerate the effort to vaccinate America's teens and adolescents.

""The ability to store Pfizer vaccine in refrigerators for a period of time is great news as this makes the vaccine more readily available to the public because community clinicians like me are able to get store and deliver vaccinations to help us reach the last mile have more flexibility in distribution plans and reach areas where vaccines may be harder to access in a timely manner"" said Dr. Jay Bhatt an internist in Chicago and an ABC News medical contributor.

Since the early days of the vaccine race scientists at both Pfizer and Moderna have fixated on storage temperature. Both vaccines rely on a molecule called messenger RNA or mRNA which is extremely fragile. This meant distribution sites would have to be limited and the cost and difficulty of shipments would be high.

When the vaccines were authorized last December both required ultra-cold temperatures for long-term storage. But Moderna proved to the FDA that its vaccine was stable for a month in cooler temperatures -- such as a standard refrigerator. Pfizer's vaccine meanwhile could only be kept in a fridge for five days meaning this vaccine was often earmarked for use in cities where medical centers had access to deep-freeze storage.

John Thys/Pool via Reuters

Now Pfizer's new convenient storage requirements break down one more barrier in reaching wider portions of the population.

Experts said the Pfizer vaccine will now have better local access with greater flexibility for walk-in appointments and primary care access to vaccine supply. Meanwhile there will be less concern about the vaccines going to waste. And for adolescents and teens -- who now comprise more than a quarter of reported daily vaccinations -- the simplification in storage requirements brings further opportunities to vaccinate in pediatrician offices and school settings.

Alongside the change in cold storage Pfizer is also preparing to distribute smaller packages of doses -- a box of 450 -- in addition to the prior size of 1170. This flexibility means that smaller clinical settings that support harder to reach populations may be in a better position to receive shipments.

""Allowing both Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines to be stored at refrigerator temperatures and to be distributed in smaller quantities will make a tremendous impact on both access and equity of vaccine distribution. These changes mean that the vaccine can be delivered more easily in people's neighborhoods on mobile vans and importantly at community health centers"" Dr. Katherine Gergen Barnett vice chair of primary care innovation and transformation and the program director in the department of family medicine at Boston Medical Center told ABC News.

The science of ultra-cold

It took decades of scientific research to invent mRNA vaccines and figure out how to store them at a reasonable temperature. The journey was beset by challenges.

First it was difficult to get mRNA into a cell; the body quickly degraded it. Scientists overcame those hurdles by using synthetic RNA that the body's immune system doesn't recognize and encasing that material in lipid nanoparticles. These strands of genetic code in the COVID-19 vaccine carry instructions that the human cell uses to manufacture the spike protein which sits on the surface of SARS-CoV-2.

If the RNA strand bends it can spark a reaction that cuts the message off and there is a loss of function. To slow degradation scientists keep the vaccines at low temperatures. The lower the temperatures the slower the molecular movements and the lower the chance of damaging reactions. For an mRNA vaccine to work the structure of the mRNA as well as the fat bubbles encasing it must be injected intact.

Now as science continues to evolve new versions of even more stable mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 seem to be on the horizon. And experts are hopeful mRNA could be used to develop vaccines for HIV influenza Zika and rabies all of which will benefit from the discoveries of today.

""This important move to bring vaccines more locally removes some barriers to access -- people can receive the vaccine in their homes do not have to take extra time from work can receive the vaccine from people they trust -- and ultimately is a tool in creating greater health equity"" Gergen Barnett said.

According to a tweet from LAUSD Superintendent Austin Beutner the program will build on other relief efforts that the district offered throughout the pandemic which included ""130 million meals 40 million school supply items 500000 students with computer and internet access [and] 1.3 million COVID tests.""

""What we're trying to do is to make sure our students have access in a place they know they trust"" Beutner told NBC4 in an interview on Thursday. ""Young adults need agency.""

Where Can My Child Get Vaccinated?

According to a community update given by Beutner on May 17 the mobile team will visit ""about 250 school sites"" to ensure each student has the chance to get vaccinated at the location closest to home.

There are also permanent vaccination sites at the following schools:

Burbank Middle School: 6460 N Figueroa St Los Angeles 90042 Carson High School: 22328 S Main St Carson 90745 Crenshaw High School: 5010 11th Ave Los Angeles 90043 Elizabeth Learning Center: 4811 Elizabeth St Cudahy 90201 Fremont High School: 7676 San Pedro St Los Angeles 90003 Gage Middle School: 2880 E Gage Ave Huntington Park 90255 Garfield High School: 5101 E 6th St East Los Angeles 90022 Hollenbeck Middle School: 2510 E 6th St Los Angeles 90023 Jefferson High School: 1319 E 41st St Los Angeles 90011 Lincoln High School: 3501 N Broadway Los Angeles 90031 Maclay Middle School: 12540 Pierce St Pacoima 91331 Manual Arts High School: 4131 Vermont Ave Los Angeles 90037 Markham Middle School: 1650 E 104th St Los Angeles 90002 Monroe High School: 9229 Haskell Ave North Hills 91343 Panorama High School: 8015 Van Nuys Blvd Panorama City 91402 Santee Education Complex: 1921 Maple Ave Los Angeles 90011 South East High School: 2720 Tweedy Blvd South Gate 90280 Stevenson Middle School: 725 S Indiana St Los Angeles 90023 Washington Preparatory High School: 10860 Denker Ave Los Angeles 90047

Those permanent clinics are ""in neighborhoods which have been most impacted by the virus"" according to the community update.

When Will the Vaccinations Take Place?

The efforts will begin on Monday May 24 and will last 13 days. The program will be repeated again over the summer according to Beutner.

""We want to start vaccinating students during this school year while teachers staff and students are still in schools"" the community update said adding that the mobile vaccination clinics ""will visit each school on a predetermined schedule"" to provide vaccines to students and ensure they have all had the chance to get vaccinated closest to home.

That schedule is available on the LAUSD website.

The summer program will provide a second opportunity for students to get their first dose if they do not get their vaccine during the push starting on May 24.

What Kind of Vaccine Will Be Offered?

All students taking part in the program will receive the Pfizer vaccine.

LAUSD has been offering Moderna vaccines to those adults who previously registered to received a COVID-19 vaccine at a LAUSD site according to the LAUSD website.

The only vaccine that is currently approved under emergency use authorization by the FDA for use on children younger than age 18 is the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna has released preliminary data that states their vaccine is safe on children ages 12 to 17 according to AAP News but has not yet received emergency use authorization for children from the Food and Drug Administration.

How Will Second Doses Work?

According to a spokesperson from LAUSD all students who get their first dose during the vaccination program starting May 24 or during the repeat program over the summer will automatically get a notification for their second dose appointment.

The mobile clinics for their second dose will be back at the same school site where they received their first vaccine the spokesperson said.

Will Vaccines Be Required for Students in the Fall?

It depends on when the FDA moves COVID vaccines from the ""emergency use authorization"" status they have right now to full approval for use.

Once that occurs Beutner told NBC4 on Thursday it is ""likely"" students will be required to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

""Right now it's a coalition of the willing"" he explained with students teachers and other members of the LAUSD community voluntarily getting their shots. Eventually however COVID vaccinations will likely join vaccines against measles and mumps and tests for tuberculosis as a requirement for attendance.

How Do I Register My Child for a Vaccine?

LAUSD asks that parents register for their child's appointment by calling the Family Vaccination Hotline at 213-328-3958 by visiting lausd.net or through the Daily Pass app.

An LAUSD spokesperson said that no matter how the appointment is scheduled all students ages 12 through 16 need a family member present with them during their vaccination.

Students ages 17 and 18 can get vaccinated with just a note from a parent or guardian Beutner told NBC4 on Thursday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvdi51ay9nb3Zlcm5tZW50L25ld3MvdmFjY2luZXMtaGlnaGx5LWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1hZ2FpbnN0LWItMS02MTctMi12YXJpYW50LWFmdGVyLTItZG9zZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vaccines highly effective against B.1.617.2 variant after 2 doses,"Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant is similar after 2 doses compared to the B.1.1.7 (Kent) variant dominant in the UK and we expect to see even higher levels of effectiveness against hospitalisation and death.

The study found that for the period from 5 April to 16 May:

the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant 2 weeks after the second dose compared to 93% effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 variant

2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were 60% effective against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant compared to 66% effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 variant

both vaccines were 33% effective against symptomatic disease from B.1.617.2 3 weeks after the first dose compared to around 50% effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 variant

The analysis included data for all age groups from 5 April to cover the period since the B.1.617.2 variant emerged. It included 1054 people confirmed as having the B.1.617.2 variant through genomic sequencing including participants of several ethnicities. Data published on Thursday 20 May for vaccine effectiveness covered the period since December for those aged over 65.

The difference in effectiveness between the vaccines after 2 doses may be explained by the fact that rollout of second doses of AstraZeneca was later than for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and other data on antibody profiles show it takes longer to reach maximum effectiveness with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

As with other variants even higher levels of effectiveness are expected against hospitalisation and death. There are currently insufficient cases and follow-up periods to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes from the B.1.617.2 variant. PHE will continue to evaluate this over the coming weeks.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:

This new evidence is groundbreaking – and proves just how valuable our COVID-19 vaccination programme is in protecting the people we love. We can now be confident that over 20 million people – more than 1 in 3 – have significant protection against this new variant and that number is growing by the hundreds of thousands every single day as more and more people get that vital second dose. I want to thank the scientists and clinicians who have been working around the clock to produce this research. It’s clear how important the second dose is to secure the strongest possible protection against COVID-19 and its variants – and I urge everyone to book in their jab when offered.

Dr Mary Ramsay Head of Immunisation at PHE  said:

This study provides reassurance that 2 doses of either vaccine offer high levels of protection against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant. We expect the vaccines to be even more effective at preventing hospitalisation and death so it is vital to get both doses to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging variants.

Minister for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawi said:

The companies which together developed the first vaccine to be authorized for use in the United States and Europe made the announcement at a global health summit in Rome co-hosted by the European Union’s executive arm and Italy.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said they expect to provide a billion of the doses this year and another billion in 2022.

It was unclear whether the deliveries would take place through the UN-backed COVAX program which aims to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 shots for low-and middle-income countries or if countries would get the doses at a reduced price directly from the companies.

Bourla said his company last year adopted a three-tiered pricing policy guaranteeing that low-income countries get the shots at cost and to have middle-income nations pay about half the price wealthier nations are charged.

Earlier this week the COVAX effort suffered a major setback when its biggest supplier the Serum Institute of India announced it would likely not export any more vaccines until the end of the year due to COVID-19 crisis on the subcontinent.

As vaccination campaigns continue to progress in the Western world poorer countries are struggling to acquire supplies. The UN Security Council expressed concern this week about the small number of doses that have reached Africa.

Last week World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged rich countries to donate their vaccines before immunizing younger populations including children. Experts warn that allowing the virus to spread unchecked anywhere in the world could lead to the emergence of potentially dangerous variants.

During Friday's global health summit in Rome Italian Premier Mario Draghi said that nearly 1.5 billion vaccine doses have been administered in over 180 countries worldwide. Yet only 0.3% were in low-income countries while richer countries administered around 85%.

“The differences in the vaccination rates are staggering"" Draghi said at the event which drew representatives from the Group of 20 industrial and emerging market nations and the heads of international organizations. ""Not only are these disparities unacceptable they are also a threat so long as the virus continues to circulate freely around the world it can mutate dangerously and undermine even the most successful vaccination campaign.”

To address inequalities and contain the pandemic the head of the World Trade Organization said on the eve of the summit it's also crucial to diversify vaccine manufacturing and to have more production taking place in Africa and Latin America. The European Union raised many of the same points WTO Director-General Okonjo-Iweala made specifically looking to increase manufacturing production in Africa.

“Today Africa imports 99% of its vaccines and this has to change"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “And therefore team Europe is launching an initiative with African partners to develop vaccine production in Africa. The initiative will develop a number of regional hubs distributed across the continent and it will draw on the full toolbox of team Europe including 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) of investment.”

Despite a recent call by the United States to waive COVID-19 vaccine patents as a way to increase supplies participants at the summit were expected to insist that intellectual property rights were an important tool to boost vaccine production.

But EU parliament member from Italy David Sassoli said that sharing patents is a necessity during the health crisis.

“The entire international community must take shared responsibility. This is why we support the call to negotiate a new global treaty to strengthen the common system for monitoring and responding to epidemics” he said.

Sassoli’s views are not widely shared; there is a lack of consensus among EU countries on a temporary waiver of patent rights for COVID-19 vaccines. EU officials have argued that waiving patents would yield no short-term or intermediate improvement and could even have a negative impact.

Draghi said Italy is open to the idea on the condition that the any waiver measure is “targeted and time-limited and does not undermine incentives for pharmaceutical companies to innovate.”"

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld asked a federal appeals court on Thursday to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion saying he didn't commit a crime.

If the convictions are allowed to stand attorney Yaakov Roth told a three-judge panel during oral arguments it could expose every elected official in the country to prosecution for accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld a former Cincinnati city councilman was found guilty of the charges in 2022 and sentenced last year to 16 months in prison. He's five months into that sentence now. But he is appealing his convictions and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Thursday.

The roughly 40-minute hearing took place in a courtroom packed with Sittenfeld supporters as well as attorneys interested in the outcome of the appeal which partly centers on what is corrupt when it comes to a politician accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld himself was not in the courtroom.

Roth began his argument by pointing to amicus briefs filed by 16 former federal public corruption prosecutors as well as a bipartisan group of former attorneys general and federal judges.

All of them Roth said are trying ""to tell this court that something has gone wrong.""

Judges question both sides

The judges − John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy − continuously asked questions of both sides throughout.

Many questions focused on whether Sittenfeld's actions were sufficient to be considered crimes. The judges also asked about topics that were raised repeatedly throughout the trial and in post-trial court filings.

Some questions centered on whether there was clear and unambiguous evidence of an exchange of money for official action − a quid pro quo.

At one point Nalbandian pointed out that Sittenfeld had promised to ""deliver the votes"" and get a ""veto-proof majority"" of City Council to support a development project in exchange for a $20000 donation to his political action committee.

Why couldn't the jury conclude that was evidence of corruption? he asked Roth.

Roth responded that prosecutors had strung together Sittenfeld's statements ""to make it into something it's not.""

Judges focus on conversation with developer

Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Singer spent much of his 15 minutes of argument time responding to questions from the judges.

Two judges asked specifically about a recorded conversation between Sittenfeld and a local developer during which they talked about supporting Sittenfeld's then-planned mayoral campaign.

As Sittenfeld and the developer Chinedum Ndukwe talked about campaign donations Sittenfeld said: ""You don't want me … to be like 'Hey Chin like love you but can't.'""

Prosecutors at trial said Sittenfeld was threatening to withhold support for the project unless Ndukwe contributed. But Roth argued that the statement wasn't sufficient evidence of a crime and said it seemed as if prosecutors had stopped focusing on it.

During arguments Thursday Nalbandian asked Singer if prosecutors were ""running away"" from the ""love you but can't"" comment.

Singer said the statement was one part of a ""corrupt solicitation"" that involved multiple statements. It was ""evidence the jury could consider"" he said.

What's next

A decision is not expected to come for some time possibly not until after Sittenfeld completes his prison term.

Roth on Thursday asked the court to consider releasing him from prison while it considers the appeal. The judges did not indicate whether they will consider that. The decision impacts Sittenfeld's future because a felony conviction prevents him from holding public office ever again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9maW5hbmNlLzIwMjQvZmlubGV0ZS1vZmZlcnMtcGctdmVyc2lvbi1vZi1vbmx5ZmFucy10aHJvdWdoLWF0aGxldGUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLTEyMzQ3NzgyNTUv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvMjAyNC9maW5sZXRlLW9mZmVycy1wZy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLW9ubHlmYW5zLXRocm91Z2gtYXRobGV0ZS1pbnZlc3RpbmctMTIzNDc3ODI1NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finlete Offers ‘PG Version of OnlyFans’ as Pro Investing Grows,"Rob Connolly’s first athlete-related start-up was Meetlete a sports-star version of Cameo. Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Collisions with deer and moose can be deadly both for the animal as well as the driver. Those signs are there to heighten your alertness and are vital to limiting accidents with animals. Unfortunately for a driver on the Maine Turnpike there was no warning to the horrifying incident that took place near Exit 19 in Wells when they came face to face with a bald eagle on the road.

WARNING: THE VIDEO EMBEDDED BELOW COULD BE TOO GRAPHIC FOR SOME

Shared on Reddit by Meat_Boye the video is short and shows the unfortunate collision between a driver and a bald eagle on the highway. it appears that the bald eagle got caught in a draft on a very gusty day. The eagle ended up low near the road and based on the video there was simply nothing the driver could do to avoid the collision with the majestic bird.

If you can handle rewatching the video you'll noticed the driver swerves between two lanes in an attempt to avoid the bald eagle. Despite the ugly ending for the bald eagle this collision could have been much worse for the driver and/or other drivers had the highway been more congested at that very moment.

Chip Ganassi Racing flexed its muscle Saturday during Crown Royal Armed Forces Qualifying for the 105th Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge as Scott Dixon led all four of the team’s cars into the Firestone Fast Nine Shootout with the fastest qualifying run on the first attempt overall of the day.

There also was drama at the opposite end of the field as 2018 Indy 500 winner Will Power was relegated to Last Chance Qualifying on Sunday after his two runs were too slow to make the top 30.

Six-time and reigning NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Dixon was the first driver on track when qualifying started at noon (ET) after his team earned the first spot in the qualifying draw Friday night and he delivered in the best track and air conditions of the five-hour 50-minute session. Dixon produced a four-lap average speed of 231.828 mph in the No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda and his car number stayed atop the iconic Scoring Pylon for the rest of the day despite 58 attempts to topple it.

“You forget how stressful this is” Dixon said. “It’s the first time I’ve ever gone first. It’s pretty interesting. Huge credit to everyone on the PNC Bank Grow Up Great car.

“It was a fairly smooth run. I made a mistake on Lap 2 which probably cost us a tenth or two from the average.”

2008 Indianapolis 500 winner Dixon will make the last attempt in the Firestone Fast Nine Shootout which determines the NTT P1 Award winner for pole and the starting order for the first three rows as the nine fastest cars from today start in inverse order in the one-shot format. The Shootout takes place from 3-3:45 p.m. on the 2.5-mile oval and will be televised live on NBC and Peacock.

Dixon will be the favorite to earn his fourth Indy 500 pole but the powerful Ganassi team will have four chances to take the coveted top spot. CGR drivers Tony Kanaan (third 231.639 No. 48 The American Legion Honda) Alex Palou (seventh 231.145 No. 10 NTT DATA Chip Ganassi Racing Honda) and Marcus Ericsson (ninth 231.104 No. 8 Huski Chocolate Chip Ganassi Racing Honda) also made the Shootout.

“Tomorrow will be a different day; it's going to be different conditions” Dixon said. “Hopefully all four of us can hit it right.”

But Ganassi’s day lost some of its sparkle at 3:35 p.m. when Palou crashed in Turn 2 while making his second qualifying attempt. Palou didn’t withdraw his first run preserving his spot in the Shootout but still was trying to improve his position when the rear of his car got loose and made heavy right-side contact with the SAFER Barrier inflicting significant damage.

Palou climbed from his car without injury but the Ganassi team will face a long night repairing the car for the Shootout on Sunday.

Other drivers participating in the Shootout are Colton Herta (second 231.648 No. 26 Gainbridge Honda) Ed Carpenter (fourth 231.616 No. 20 SONAX Chevrolet) Rinus VeeKay (fifth 231.483 No. 21 Bitcoin Chevrolet) three-time “500” winner Helio Castroneves (sixth 231.164 No. 06 AutoNation/SiriusXM Honda) and 2014 Indy winner Ryan Hunter-Reay (ninth 231.139 No. 28 DHL Honda).

Cloud cover broke shortly after the first trip through the original 35-car qualifying draw and the sunshine raised track temperatures nearly 25 degrees decreasing traction and engine efficiency. That prevented any successful attempts at bumping into the Fast Nine from multiple drivers after the first run through the draw but there was plenty of suspense and tension at the back end of the grid in the final hour.

2014 series champion Power will be one of the five drivers trying to take one of the three last-row spots during Last Chance Qualifying which takes place from 1:15-2:30 p.m. and will be televised on NBCSN and Peacock. Power winner of 62 poles in his INDYCAR SERIES career failed to record a speed in the top 30 in two attempts in the No. 12 Verizon 5G Team Penske Chevrolet.

Power’s first run at 1:21 p.m. averaged 229.052 and ended up outside the top 30. But he withdrew that attempt to jump a long line of cars in the “normal” lane and make his second attempt from the “fast” lane ensuring he got another shot. That run at 5:33 p.m. 17 minutes before the end of qualifying averaged 229.228 and also wasn’t fast enough.

“You need to be scientist to work this one out” Power said. “I guess we have to go tomorrow. We gave it our best shot today. I think if we just do a conservative run tomorrow we should be OK.”

Joining Power in the Last Chance Qualifying will be Sage Karam (No. 24 DRR-AES INDIANA Chevrolet) Charlie Kimball (No. 11 Tresiba/AJ Foyt Racing Chevrolet) Simona De Silvestro (No. 16 Rocket Pro TPO/Paretta Autosport Chevrolet) and RC Enerson (No. 75 Top Gun Racing Chevrolet).

Dalton Kellett exhaled most deeply among the drivers toward the rear of the field as he avoided the Last Row Shootout and will start 30th in the No. 4 K-Line Insulators/AJ Foyt Racing Chevrolet.

A 30-minute practice for the five Last Chance Qualifying participants will take place from 11-11:30 a.m. Sunday followed by a 30-minute session for Firestone Fast Nine Shootout participants from 11:30-noon. An open practice will follow the Last Chance Qualifying and Shootout from 5-7 p.m. All three of those sessions will be broadcast on Peacock.",,,,,,,,,

But families should still do some comparison shopping before choosing a plan advisers say.

“It’s still the best option to save substantial amounts of money” said Scott Beaudin principal of Pathway Financial Advisors in South Burlington Vt.

State-sponsored 529 plans offer accounts that can be used to save and invest for college. More recently plans allow families to save on other types of educational expenses like private kindergarten-through-grade 12 tuition and even apprenticeships. Money deposited in a 529 account grows tax-free and is withdrawn tax-free when spent on eligible expenses. (There is no federal tax deduction for 529 contributions but many states offer tax breaks.)

Some states began offering college savings programs as early as the late 1980s but federal legislation in 1996 and 2001 helped expand 529 savings accounts nationally. Now 49 states (Wyoming is the exception) and the District of Columbia offer 529 savings plans — named for a section of the federal tax code.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxjZmMuY29tL25ld3MvMjE1MzgyMC9sZWljZXN0ZXItY2l0eS0tZmJzLWFubm91bmNlLXJlY29yZC1uZXctcHJpbmNpcGFsLWNsdWItcGFydG5lcnNoaXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leicester City & FBS Announce Record New Principal Club Partnership,"Leicester City has signed a new three-year agreement with the global online trading company FBS as its principal club partner.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Business deals and birthdays. But after a colon cancer diagnosis in his mid-40s he began donning red socks every morning. He wore them with suits and khakis even shorts.

It was a shtick — he loved a good shtick — but one reflecting his belief that each day is worth celebrating.

Each person too. As CEO of Universal Hospital Services Dovenberg wrote sweet limericks for retiring employees. As a father he dressed up for date nights with his daughter.

""Dave had a knack for making people from all areas of his life realize that he valued them"" said Jean Dovenberg his wife of 50 years. ""He made people understand that they were important. It was an incredible gift.""

A cancer survivor and CEO mentor and volunteer Dovenberg died May 10 after a stroke. He was 76.

At Robbinsdale High School he was a bright student. But his parents didn't have the means to pay for college said Jean who met Dave in 1964 when they were camp counselors. His father's boss and World War II shipmate offered to fund Dovenberg's education at Gustavus Adolphus College. Dovenberg pledged to pay it forward.

David Dovenberg

After earning his master's degree in economics from the University of Minnesota he worked at Prudential Insurance Co. In 1988 he became chief financial officer at the Bloomington-based Universal Hospital Services now Agiliti which rents movable medical equipment to hospitals.

""He certainly knew the financials"" said Margaret Radke longtime adviser to his executive leadership team. ""But he understood that people were the heart of the business.""

As chairman president and CEO he trekked to the company's 60-plus offices for face-to-face meetings. He remembered employees' birthdays and kids' names. He gave people Lucite desk ornaments of tiny red socks — a reminder that ""you have the freedom to choose your response to life's struggles"" as Radke put it.

During tough moments including a successful effort in 1998 to recapitalize the company Dovenberg could become somber or stressed Radke said. ""But I never saw Dave in a sour mood. He never felt sorry for himself.""

It's a lesson he took from his cancer surgery at age 44 which left him with a colostomy. That year in a reflective essay he vowed that ""from now on I will pick more daisies."" He wished to be sillier more relaxed more limber.

""Financial success and security have been paramount sometimes at the expense of health and happiness"" he wrote. ""Oh I have had my mad moments and from now on I will have more of them; in fact I'll try to have nothing else just moments one after another instead of living so many years ahead.""

Thanks in part to his loud easy laugh ""you wanted to be around him"" said Bob Strickland a friend since working together at Prudential. ""He was the center of attention — without ever being egotistical.""

A Wayzata resident he volunteered and donated often anonymously encouraging his grandkids to fill a Target cart with Christmas gifts for the less fortunate.

To raise money for the American Cancer Society he earned pledges for a charity golf event by soliciting silly dares according to an article in Minnesota Golfer. He golfed a hole in mittens another in a hat adorned with a foot-long stuffed fish. On one hole he stopped to sniff each flower.

""It was always about bringing joy"" said his daughter Kirsten Murphy. ""He wasn't just going to golf in the Longest Day of Golf — he was going to wear goofy outfits and golf an entire hole with a putter.""

A ""lousy"" golfer Dovenberg chaired the golfing event. A ""terrible"" fisherman he brought his son Robert and the men in his family on a fishing trip to Canada each year. His laugh echoed down the golf course and across the lake.

A funeral will be held 10 a.m. Monday at St. Philip the Deacon Lutheran Church in Plymouth with a visitation at 9 a.m.

The report builds on the global framework set out in the authors’ recent publication Net-zero central banking: A new phase in greening the financial system and applies its approach to the specific priorities and mandates of EU central banks.

Main messages

Climate neutrality is a key pillar of the European Union’s Green Deal programme together with strengthening resilience to physical shocks and ensuring that the transition process is fair and just.

The first signs that EU central banks are recognising the imperative of alignment with net-zero are beginning to emerge. A comprehensive approach is now required not least as part of the European Central Bank’s strategy review.

To make this happen the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) with the ECB at its helm needs to mainstream net-zero across all ESCB operations.

There is a compelling two-fold rationale for doing this: first net-zero is the best way of minimising the risks of climate change to the stability of the EU economy and financial system; and second EU central banks and supervisors need to ensure that their activities are coherent with the EU’s and member states’ climate neutrality policies.

Recommendations for upgrading EU central bank and supervisor approaches in line with climate neutrality

Strategy: EU central banks and supervisors need to develop a climate neutrality roadmap with long-term expectations and near-term actions. This would include the promotion of close liaison between policymakers and central banks. The mission statement of the ECB should be updated to include the EU’s climate neutrality objective as part of this. Prudential regulation: Prudential supervisors in the EU should make climate neutrality a core element of supervisory practice at micro and macro levels aligning supervisory expectations and prudential instruments with net-zero. This would involve requiring all regulated financial institutions to submit net-zero transition plans. Prudential capital requirements should also reflect financial institutions’ exposure to climate risks. Scenarios: Forward-looking scenarios used by EU central banks and supervisors need to become more consistent with a climate neutrality pathway to limiting warming to 1.5°C and complemented with short-term outlooks. Monetary policy: The ESCB needs to consistently integrate climate neutrality into monetary frameworks and models to adequately account for the impacts of climate change on macroeconomic outcomes. In addition central bank instruments and policy portfolios need to become operationally aligned with net-zero. Portfolio management: Sustainable and responsible investment practices in all European central bank portfolios should include a climate neutrality target and central banks should each publish a transition plan to achieve this. Just transition: EU central banks should assess the implications of net-zero for jobs and livelihoods and explore policy options to mitigate potential downside sectoral and regional consequences. International cooperation: Climate neutrality needs to be incorporated into the way that EU central banks operate within key international financial and regulatory frameworks and processes. The EU’s central banks have the potential to be global leaders in climate-neutral central banking.

As the effects of the hack mounted the company shut down the pipeline and that led to a spike in the price of gasoline as well as days of widespread fuel shortages. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency. DarkSide reportedly walked away with a five-million-dollar ransom but receiving the payout appears to have come at a cost. On May 14th DarkSide’s site went down and the group said that it has lost access to many of its communication and payment tools—as a result of either retaliation from the U.S. or a decision by the members who fund the organization to pull the plug themselves.

DarkSide is a so-called ransomware-as-a-service enterprise meaning that it does not actually perform the labor of carrying out cyberattacks. Instead it provides affiliated hackers with a range of services from handling negotiations to processing payments. It had a blog and a user-friendly interface for hackers to upload and publish stolen information. When DarkSide débuted on Russian-language cybercrime forums last August its launch announcement sounded like a tech entrepreneur’s pitch deck. “We created DarkSide because we didn’t find the perfect product for us” it read. “Now we have it.” It set out a sliding fee scale ranging from twenty-five per cent of ransoms worth less than half a million dollars to ten per cent of those worth five million or more.

Ransomware as a service like the modern tech economy as a whole has evolved to account for a high degree of specialization with each participant in the marketplace providing discrete skills. An operation such as DarkSide’s attack against Colonial Pipeline begins with an individual or team of hackers known as “individual access brokers” who penetrate a target company’s network. From that point another hacker moves laterally to the domain controller the server in charge of security and user access and installs the ransomware code there. (DarkSide among its many services has offered its own brand of malware for locking and extracting data.) Once a victim’s servers have been breached and its computer systems frozen the hackers hand things over to the operators of a ransomware-as-a-service outfit who manage everything else including determining a ransom value communicating with victim organizations and arranging the particulars of payment. “That’s the stuff you as a hacker don’t want to deal with” Mark Arena the C.E.O. of Intel 471 a private cyberintelligence firm said. “You don’t have the patience or the social skills.”

On May 10th Biden said U.S. intelligence believes that DarkSide is located in Russia even if there is “no evidence” that links it to the Russian state. Like many revenue streams in the cybercrime underworld ransomware as a service is largely though not entirely dominated by Russian-speaking hackers with roots in Russia and other former Soviet states. (There are plenty of exceptions such as North Korea’s state-run hacking teams who specialize in online bank theft.)

The reasons for this situation go back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the nineteen-nineties when highly competent engineers programmers and technicians were suddenly left adrift. Decades later the story hasn’t changed much: younger generations of Russians have access to specialized educations in physics computer science and mathematics but have few outlets to realize those talents at least not for the kinds of salaries available to programmers in say Silicon Valley. “And what do they see when they go online? That it’s possible with their knowledge and skills to earn millions of dollars just like that” Sergey Golovanov the chief security expert at Kaspersky Lab a cybersecurity company based in Moscow said. “A certain percentage of these people decide it’s worth breaking the law.”

Such a career can look all the more attractive given that the risks seem rather small at least if you focus on Western targets. Although Russian law-enforcement bodies periodically mount operations aimed at domestic cybercriminals they generally turn a blind eye to those who use Russia as a base for infiltrating foreign networks. That is partly a function of legal jurisdiction and investigative wherewithal. If there’s no victim on Russian territory who can show up in person to file a police report and offer evidence for a criminal trial then there isn’t much for the authorities to pursue. “Even if Russia law enforcement was so inclined there would be nothing to investigate” Alexey Lukatsky a noted cybersecurity consultant in Moscow said.

To insure that they don’t run into trouble on their home turf most ransomware-as-a-service sites prohibit the targeting of companies or institutions in Russia or within the territory of the former Soviet Union. “Hackers have a rule: don’t work on the .ru domain” Golovanov said. In DarkSide’s case part of its malware code scanned for languages installed on the target workstation; if it detected Russian or another language common to post-Soviet countries it did not deploy and erased itself from the machine.

But there is also one further very important reason why cybercriminals may feel relatively free to operate from inside of Russia. Russia’s security services are tempted to see hackers who target Western corporations governments and individuals less as a threat than as a resource. In 2014 the F.B.I. indicted a Russian hacker named Evgeniy Bogachev on charges of allegedly stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from bank accounts across the globe; American prosecutors asked their Russian counterparts for coöperation. Rather than arrest Bogachev however Russian authorities used his breaches to hunt for files and e-mails on devices belonging to government employees and contractors in the United States Georgia and Turkey. As the Times wrote the Russian state was in effect “grafting an intelligence operation onto a far-reaching cybercriminal scheme sparing themselves the hard work of hacking into the computers themselves.”

In a 2012 policy paper titled “Beyond Attribution” Jason Healey the director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council proposed assessing state responsibility in hacking attacks on a continuum ranging from “state-prohibited” to “state-integrated.” It is unclear exactly where the DarkSide attack against Colonial Pipeline falls on that line or what Biden meant when he said that Russia “bears some responsibility to deal with this.” So far the publicly available evidence suggests a categorization in Healey’s taxonomy of “state-ignored” in which a “national government knows about the third-party attacks but as a matter of policy is unwilling to take any official action.”

For its part the Kremlin has rejected any suggestion that it carries some blame for not doing more to rein in the activities of groups like DarkSide. “Russia has nothing to do with this” Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. But accusations of Russian involvement in major hacking operations have at this point become commonplace. Just a month ago Biden sanctioned Russia for the SolarWinds breach in which at least nine separate federal agencies and a hundred private companies had their networks compromised by Russian intelligence services. “In Russia we are used to allegations that we hack everyone and everything” Lukatsky told me wryly.

Meanwhile the Russian-language cybercrime forums that historically functioned as a marketplace for DarkSide have banned the group from their portals. The word ‘ransom’ “has become dangerous and toxic” one administrator wrote noting that the last thing Russian criminal hackers and their associates want is to create problems for the Kremlin. “Peskov is forced to make excuses in front of our overseas ‘friends’—this is nonsense and a sign things have gone too far.”

But no one expects the practice to go away. A number of the largest ransomware-as-a-service outfits announced that they will move to operate in “private” mode ceasing to advertise on the dark Web and accepting only affiliate hackers whom they know and trust. They have also said that they will take a more active role in vetting and approving targets ahead of time. As for DarkSide itself it will likely regroup and rebrand as a new product—a very tech-world sort of recovery from a public flameout. “Such people don’t remain out of work forever” Dmitry Volkov the chief technology officer of Group-IB a Moscow cybersecurity company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvYmlrZS1zaGFyaW5nLXNoaWZ0cy1pbnRvLW1vcmUtbWFuYWdlYWJsZS1nZWFyLTIwMjEtMDUtMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breakingviews - Bike sharing shifts into a more manageable gear,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/bike-sharing-shifts-into-more-manageable-gear-2021-05-24/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvYmlrZS1zaGFyaW5nLXNoaWZ0cy1pbnRvLW1vcmUtbWFuYWdlYWJsZS1nZWFyLTIwMjEtMDUtMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Located in The Hollow region of Hersheypark Comet is best known for delighting generations of riders 42"" and taller (Reese's height category and above) during Springtime In The Park summer and Hersheypark In The Dark.

The modified double out-and-back classic wood coaster has two 24 passenger trains aptly named ""Mork's Comet"" and ""Halley's Comet."" The ride experience begins as soon as the train leaves the station and immediately climbs 96 feet up the chain lift hill. The coaster then rumbles down the first 47-degree drop and flies back up the next hill to make a swooping 180-degree turn that reveals a stunning view of The Hollow. Comet dips back down towards Spring Creek and sends riders on a series of twisting turns and hair-raising hills. A handful of airtime-filled bunny hills give riders a final thrill before arriving back at the station. Comet reaches a top speed of 50 miles per hour during its 3360-foot journey that lasts 1 minute 45 seconds.

HP Elite Folio specs Price: $1889

CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen2

GPU: Qualcomm Adreno 690

RAM: 16GB

Storage: 256GB

Display: 13.5-inch 1920 x 1280-pixels

Battery: 16:21

Size: 11.75 x 9.03 x 0.63 in

Weight: 2.9 pounds

The HP Elite Folio is packed with innovative solution-solving tech — not gimmicks — that substantiates its $2000 price tag. It also gives the Energizer Bunny a run for its money; it lasted a jaw-dropping 16 hours and 21 minutes on a charge. I haven’t tested a laptop that offered a 16-hour runtime since the Samsung Galaxy Book Flex 15  so the Elite Folio’s vitality threw me for a loop.

Not only does the Elite Folio have the endurance of an Olympic champion but it breaks records like one too. The Elite Folio is the world’s first business convertible with a spectacular pull-forward mechanism. The feature lets you transform the display into a digital easel so you can get your Bob Ross on. The Elite Folio comes with an awesome stylus — a plus for users who have an affinity for digital note taking and doodling.

It may sound like I’m raving about the Elite Folio but the truth is it’s not for everyone. If you’re a professional content creator with an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription don’t bother — this Windows-on-ARM HP convertible won’t meet your high-performance needs.

HP makes it clear that the Elite Folio is for on-the-go business users who want a premium funky laptop that can manage all their light day-to-day tasks such as web browsing emailing and Zoom calls. You’re paying a premium for HP’s innovative display its compact form factor and integrated fast-charging stylus — not industry-leading performance.

HP Elite Folio pricing and configurations

The HP Elite Folio starts at $1786 and comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 CPU Qualcomm Adreno 690 graphics 8GB of RAM 256GB of NVMe storage and a 13.5-inch 1920 x 1280-pixel display.

My review unit costs $1889 which bumps the specs up to 16GB of RAM.

HP Elite Folio design

I took my first whiff of the Elite Folio and melted into olfactory heaven. “This smells so damn good!” I said. Wrapped in what HP calls “vegan leather” a fancy name for pleather the Elite Folio emanated that fresh new car smell that I love. Not only does the Elite Folio look premium but it smells like it too — like a wealthy businessman wearing earthy woody cologne.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

If you spotted an unopened Elite Folio lying around you’d never in a million years think it’s a laptop. It looks like an antique leather-bound journal filled with memoirs from your great-great grandfather but little do you know that technological marvels lie within.

The HP logo on the center of the lid is subdued allowing the onyx pleather-coated chassis to shine. Open the laptop and you’ll find ultra-narrow side bezels. Top bezel is slightly thicker to accommodate a 720p webcam. Its chin is thin sporting a miniature silver HP logo. Below the chin you’ll find a stylus sleeping soundly in its silo. Unfortunately you’ll have to awake it from its slumber when you blast the Bang & Olufsen speakers that flank the backlit keyboard.

The deck mimics the onyx shade of the lid giving off a stern professional appearance. If you carry this laptop around people will know that you mean business. At first glance this HP laptop may seem traditional but there’s a whole fiesta hiding within the display which I’ll dive into later.

The Elite Folio weighing 2.9 pounds and measuring 0.6 inches of thickness is slightly heavier than its lightweight competitors: the LG Gram 14 2-in-1 (0.7 inches 2.5 pounds) and the Microsoft Surface Pro X (0.3 inches 1.7 pounds)

HP Elite Folio ports

The HP laptop has two USB 3.2 Type-C ports: one on the left and another on the right. Also on the right is a headset jack. Unfortunately the HP doesn’t have an SD card slot nor a USB Type-A port . The latter is understandable because the Elite Folio is too thin to accommodate thicker ports.

The Elite Folio has a poor variety of ports so if you need more I/O options check out our best USB Type-C hubs and best laptop docking stations pages.

HP Elite Folio display

HP killed it with the Elite Folio’s innovative display . Although the 13.5-inch Elite Folio is compact HP maximized its screen real estate by offering a panel with a 3:2 aspect ratio. The display — serving up an 88% screen-to-body ratio — is more tall than wide so the Elite Folio doesn’t sacrifice display spaciousness for portability.

I watched the Venom: Let There Be Carnage trailer on the Elite Folio’s 1920 x 1280 display and I was impressed with the detail. During a creepy close-up of actor Woody Harrelson I spotted the green veins behind his semi-transparent eyelids as he closed his eyes performatively. Tom Hardy’s tiny white chin hairs contrasted well with his scruffy black goatee. However the colors aren’t as punchy as I would have liked. A scene with Venom unleashing his beastly wrath lacked vividity. Most videos are optimized for 16:9 displays so keep in mind that you’ll often find some letterboxing on this screen.

The Elite Folio covers 71% of the DCI-P3 color gamut  which is less than the average premium laptop (84%). The Gram 14 (77%) and the Surface Pro X (74%) offer more coverage but not by much.

The Elite Folio outputting 390 nits outshone the average premium laptop (389 nits) on our brightness test by a hair. It also bested the Gram 14 (306 nits) however the Surface Pro X has the most brilliant display with 420 nits of brightness.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

The Elite Folio has a Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.25 (closer to 0 is better). This isn’t on par with the Surface Pro X (0.22) but it beats the average premium laptop (0.27) and the Gram 14 (0.3).

The HP convertible is also equipped with a snazzy touchscreen which responded quickly to my zippy gestures including pinch-to-zoom rapid-fire scrolling and swiping right to revisit previous pages.

HP Elite Folio pull-forward feature

The Elite Folio is the world’s first pull-forward business convertible laptop. So what exactly is the Elite Folio’s standout feature? Well you could detach the display from its traditional position and rest it in the middle of the deck optimizing the screen for streaming scribbling notes drawing and more. It’s a transformable easel right at your fingertips.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

The advantage of easel mode over other postures is that it gives you easy access to the touchpad. I launched Netflix’s The Start-Up in easel mode and for the first time ever I didn’t have anxiety about smudging the screen — I simply used the touchpad to replay shocking scenes turn on captions pause the show and more.

Elite Folio users who want to use easel mode should make sure that the display rests snugly in the magnetized space between the spacebar and the touchpad. If not they’ll find the screen to be too unstable while they’re sketching and jotting down notes.

It’s worth noting that transitioning the screen back to clamshell mode is an ungraceful awkward experience. Pushing it into position requires putting a lot of weight onto the device so you have to hold the laptop in place while the display scrapes past the keys and settles into clamshell mode.

You can also convert the Elite Folio into tablet mode. As I played around with this posture it helped me appreciate easel mode. Its titled angle similar to an artist’s canvas is the best position for digital drawing and note taking. I no longer have to hunch over a flat tablet to doodle like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

Still even in tablet mode the Elite Folio is superior to other convertibles on the market because it eliminates one of my biggest pet peeves: feeling those pesky exposed keys under my fingers.

HP Elite Folio pen

The Elite Folio comes with a stylus called the HP Elite Slim Active Pen which is nestled in a silo located above the function keys. HP also placed a nano SIM garage on the right side of the silo a useful feature for users who need reliable internet connection while they’re on-the-go. The Elite Folio is 5G compatible and equipped with Wi-Fi 6.

The stylus garage ensures that your pen stays charged while you’re not using it so whenever you’re ready to take notes or scribble you’ll know it’s powered up and ready to go. Even if you squander the battery life it can fast charge in just 30 minutes.

The Elite Slim Active Pen fits snugly between my pointer finger and thumb like it was tailor-made for me. It’s comfortable and ergonomic with its long flat design; it reminds me of Microsoft’s Surface Pro Slim Pen.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

As I played around with the pen on Whiteboard the pen strokes were smooth and seamless. There was virtually no lag. The Elite Slim Active Pen offers 4096 degrees of pressure sensitivity and uses Wacom’s AES 2.0 technology. The stylus’ buttons are all configurable via the Pen Settings app so you can have convenient access to your favorite functions.

HP Elite Folio audio

The Elite Folio is equipped with a Bang & Olufsen-tuned quad-speaker system. I tested them by blasting The Weeknd’s “Save Your Tears.” As the music turned up to max volume I was pleasantly surprised by its amplification. Don’t expect MacBook Pro -quality speakers though. The louder the song got the grittier it sounded. Unfortunately there’s no tuning software you can use to tweak the audio to your liking.

Still the Folio’s top-firing speakers are decent enough for an enjoyable Spotify jam session or a fun dive into Noise Cancelling podcast episodes.

HP Elite Folio keyboard and touchpad

Keep in mind that the 13.5-inch HP Elite Folio is a laptop designed for portability. If you have massive hands you may not feel comfortable with Elite Folio’s compact keyboard. (Check out our best 17-inch laptops page if you want something more spacious.) However if you commute often the Elite Folio sports a travel-friendly keyboard that won’t have your elbows brushing up against strangers on the train.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

I tapped away on the Elite Folio’s keyboard which has 1.3 millimeters of key travel. I can’t sing its praises enough. It’s got ultra-clicky keys and satisfying tactile feedback that I wasn’t expecting on such a compact device. On the 10FastFingers.com test I typed at 88 words per minute which is slightly higher than my 85-wpm average.

My typing experience was so fluid and rhythmic you’d think I had owned the Elite Folio for years. On top of that the keys are impressively quiet. If you’re hiding in a closet from a knife-wielding murderer — and all you have is the Elite Folio — you could email someone for help without betraying your location. If you prefer a less maniacal use case the Elite Folio is ideal for considerate office professionals who don’t want to disturb their fellow co-workers.

The 4.2 x 2.6-inch touchpad is just right: not too slick and not too resistant. Its coating felt plush against my fingers as I swiftly executed Windows 10 gestures  like pinch-to-zoom and two-finger scrolling.

HP Elite Folio performance

The Elite Folio is packed with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 chip  which has its pros and cons. On the plus side running Windows 10 on ARM offers jaw-dropping battery life that many Intel-equipped laptops can’t compete with. On the downside don’t expect top-of-the-line industry-leading performance with this SoC. Temper your expectations please.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

There are also some app compatibility issues because the Elite Folio runs on 32-bit Windows. Our lab tester couldn’t run our standard suite of tests including HDXPRT 4 and Handbrake. She also couldn’t run Sid Meier’s Civilization VI: Gathering Storm for graphics benchmarks. Bummer!

I tortured the Elite Folio with 30 Google Chrome tabs running content-heavy sites such as The Daily Mail. I fired up a new Google Doc to test the Elite Folio’s 16GB of RAM . As I began typing away there was a few seconds of lag but the HP eventually got with the program and kept up with my fast-moving fingers.

The Elite Folio with a score of 3115 didn’t snatch first place on the Geekbench 5 overall performance test but it didn’t fall dead last either. It lost to the average premium laptop (4063) and the Gram 14 (3286 Intel Core i7-10510U’s CPU) but it crushed the Surface Pro X (3077 Microsoft SQ2).

On the file-transfer test the HP’s 256GB SSD duplicated 25GB of multimedia files at a rate of 666.5 megabytes per second. That beats the average premium laptop (624.7 MBps) and the Surface Pro X (267.2 MBps 256GB SSD) but it couldn’t keep up with the Gram 14 (745.9 MBps 1TB SSD).

The Elite Folio is optimal for on-the-go business users with light productivity (e.g. internet browsing taking notes writing research papers communicating on Slack etc.). However if you’re a stickler for laptops that offer lightening-fast load times while juggling several CPU-heavy programs the Elite Folio isn’t for you.

HP Elite Folio battery life

The HP Elite Folio nearly snatched M1-based Apple MacBook Pro ’s fourth-place position on our laptops with the best battery life list. The MacBook Pro lasted 16 hours and 32 minutes and the Elite Folio was just 11 minutes short of that runtime.

On the Laptop Mag battery test which involves continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness the Elite Folio lasted 16 hours and 21 minutes. The Gram also did well on our battery test but it could not dethrone the Elite Folio with its 14-hour runtime. The Surface Pro X is the loser among the three; it tapped out after just 9 hours and 24 minutes. Womp womp.

HP Elite Folio webcam

The Elite Folio’s 720p webcam is housed on the top bezel and as expected there’s nothing special about it. Despite the vibrant hues in my testing room colors looked washed out on the camera. The picture quality also lacks detail and sharpness. On the plus side it picked up the delineation between my curls.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

Poor webcam quality is standard across the laptop industry so don’t think you can find a better camera on another notebook (except the Surface Pro X). The camera is fine for Zoom calls with friends and family but if you need a more professional-looking setup you’re better off buying an external webcam.

The HP Elite Folio heat

We tested the HP Elite Folio’s thermals on our heat test (15 minutes of a fullscreen HD video) and its underside can get a little toasty.

The touchpad (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and the center of the keyboard (92 degrees) hovered well below our 95-degree comfort threshold but the bottom — the hottest area of the HP laptop — climbed to 98 degrees.

HP Elite Folio software and warranty

The Elite Folio runs on Windows 10 Pro (32-bit). As mentioned Windows on ARM can’t run some of your favorite apps that are built for the 64-bit architecture. You can run 32-bit applications but you may experience a performance hit because they have to be emulated.

HP Elite Folio (Image credit: Future)

Sifting through HP’s preinstalled software it’s light on bloatware . There are a few useful apps including HP’s QuickDrop which lets users instantly send files photos videos and URLs to other devices. You’ll also find a handful of familiar apps such as Your Phone Xbox Sticky Notes and OneNote .

The HP Elite Folio comes with a one-year limited warranty. See how HP fared on our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands special reports.

Bottom line

The question isn’t “Would I recommend the Elite Folio?” but “Who would I recommend this HP marvel to?”

The quintessential Elite Folio user is an on-the-go busy bee with light day-to-day tasks such as emailing web browsing and hosting Zoom calls. They get a kick out of all the “oohs and aahs” they get while using the pull-forward feature. On their off days they enjoy doodling and sketching while the HP device is in easel mode. They love that their pleather-bound laptop which looks like a large fancy journal can hide in plain sight. Most importantly they don’t have to worry about being tethered to an outlet because the Elite Folio can last for more than 16 hours on a charge.

HP is transparent about the fact that the Elite Folio is not a powerhouse laptop for graphics-intensive CPU-hogging activities. Its app incompatibility issues may be a dealbreaker for some prospective buyers. If you’re a professional content creator you’re better off checking out our best laptops for video editing and photo editing pages.

Still although the Elite Folio wasn’t No. 1 in our overall performance test its benchmark scores were just behind the first-place winner: the Intel-equipped LG Gram 14 . That isn’t half bad. Not to mention that it also crushed the Microsoft Surface Pro X by a landslide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9uZXdzL29wcG8tcmVubzUtYS01Zy1zcGVjcy1ub3ctb2ZmaWNpYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPPO Reno5 A 5G specs now official » YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews,"OPPO has recently unveiled its latest smartphone in Japan the Reno5 A 5G.

WWE will be returning to the road from July 16th according to a new report as the company begins its touring schedule once again as the world emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sports Illustrated has reported that the company will resume life on the road on July 16th with SmackDown in Houston at the Toyota Center. Recently rumours had circulated that Fox was keen for WWE to get back in front of live fans in line with other sports in the US.

The Money In The Bank pay-per-view will follow on Sunday the 18th of July emanating out of Dickies Arena in Fort Worth Texas. The next night will see Raw take place inside the American Airlines Center in Dallas. These shows will be the first in what is reported to be a 25-city touring schedule that runs through to Labor Day [6th of September].

In a news update from Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer it is reported that the sixteen-time world champion John Cena could be set to make a return to the WWE ring with it being under discussion within the company.

Cena’s last WWE appearance came in the cinematic Firefly Fun House match at WrestleMania 36 in 2020. In the unique match Cena fell to apparent defeat after falling victim to The Fiend Bray Wyatt’s mandible claw.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bkElHv7EQ4

WrestleMania 37 saw the return of fans to Raymond James Stadium where over 25000 of them attended each night. But prior to that the last time WWE held a show in front of fans was Raw on the 9th of March in Washington DC. On that night the fans in the Capital One Arena witnessed the main event of the Authors Of Pain Murphy and Seth Rollins defeating The Street Profits and The Viking Raiders.

With a return to touring in front of live fans this news will also spell the end for the WWE ThunderDome. The company had used screens to show fans watching at home in lieu of a live crowd. The ThunderDome has been housed in the Amway Center Tropicana Field and most recently the Yuengling Center in Tampa Florida.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9wYXVsLW9sc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEwMzM5MDA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Olson Obituary (1967 - 2021) - Hartford CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/paul-olson-obituary?id=10339007 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9wYXVsLW9sc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEwMzM5MDA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhbmNhc3RlcmVhZ2xlZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1LzIzL2ZhaXJmaWVsZC1jb3VudHktbWFycmlhZ2VzLWFuZC1kaXZvcmNlcy1tYXktMTAtMTQvNTE2MjQzNTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fairfield County marriages and divorces May 10-14,"Staff Report

He married his first love Beverly and had three beautiful daughters Sandra Laura and Marilyn. As a young electrician Ray worked on the Dewline up north he was very proud of that. He moved to Bracebridge built a home founded Bracebridge Rent-All in 1967 until it sold in 1986.

Apparently the official Razer store on Chinese Tmall is already taking preorders on its desktop systems equipped with RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti graphics cards.

Razer pre-built system with RTX 3080 Ti Source: Razer

On Tmall systems with RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti are now available for preorder. The offer isn’t quite straightforward and the description does not always appear to match the specifications. It looks like the product page has been updated partially. In any case there seem to be RTX 3080 Ti 12GB and RTX 3070 Ti 8GB options listed which would match rumored specs of these new upcoming Ampere graphics cards.



The first system is offered in many configurations with up to 8-core Ryzen 9 5900X CPU X570 motherboard and RTX 3090 graphics. The RTX 3080 Ti appears to be an option for the premium and quite an expensive system which has a starting price of 22999 RMB (around 3500 USD). A configuration with an X570 motherboard costs 3885 USD. For comparison a system equipped with a slightly better ASUS ROG STRIX motherboard and RTX 3090 graphics is listed at 39999 RBM (6217 USD). In other words there is a 2331 USD difference between RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 Ti build.

Meanwhile the two configurations with RTX 3070 Ti graphics can be preordered for around 2100 USD with Ryzen 5 5600X and for 2331 USD with Ryzen 7 5800X.

There are some obvious mistakes in the description which might be a result of copy-posting the RTX 3080 pre-built page. For instance in some places the RTX 3080 Ti is listed with 10GB which is obviously incorrect. However it is fact that most custom models of RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3080 will look identical because these cards are to feature (more or less) the same board design and similar power requirements. So naturally we will be seeing many OEMs listing wrong specs

The listing does not appear to be a mistake both systems are advertised in multiple places in the official Razer China store on Tmall:

Pricing:

Ryzen 9 5900X B550 RTX 3080 Ti: 22999 RMB (3575 USD)

Ryzen 9 5900X X570 RTX 3080 Ti: 24999 RMB (3885 US)

Ryzen 9 5900X X570 RTX 3090: 39999 RMB (6217 USD)

Ryzen 5 5600X B550 RTX 3070 Ti: 13499 RMB (2098 USD)

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti are perhaps two of the worst kept secrets in the gaming hardware realm. The two Ampere SKUs have been rumored for months and recently we've been able to pin down exact announcement and launch windows for both cards.

Now it looks as though Razer's Chinese arm has jumped the gun by making the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti available in its preconfigured desktop systems. Systems are currently available for preorder on Razer's official store on the Tmall e-commerce platform. The listings were first discovered by @harukaze5719 on Twitter.

There are multiple configurations available including an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X system with 16GB of DDR4-3200 memory an ROG Strix B550-A motherboard an 850W 80PLUS PSU and one of NVIDIA's newfangled GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards (in this case with 12GB of GDDR6X memory).

For those that don't mind stepping down a rung or two on the performance ladder there's a Ryzen 5 5600X configuration with a B550 M-ATX motherboard 16GB of DDR4-3000 memory a 750W 80PLUS PSU and the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti (8GB GDDR6X).

The memory specs for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti match up with previous leaks that we've seen. The former will be the most potent of the two of course with a total of 10240 CUDA cores. The latter however will feature ""only"" 6144 CUDA cores. Both cards will outperform their GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 counterparts but the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti should be within earshot of the flagship GeForce RTX 3090 when it comes to performance -- and with a lower price tag.





However we all know that finding either a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or GeForce RTX 3070 Ti -- outside of prebuilt systems from OEMs -- will be next to impossible at whatever MSRP NVIDIA gives them at launch. With the current GeForce RTX 30 Series cards going for two to three times their MSRP depending on the model we don't have high hopes for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti.

It's rumored that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti will be officially announced on May 31st during an NVIDIA Computex 2021 keynote address. The cards will then go on sale on June 3rd and June 10th respectively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9hY2VyLW5pdHJvLTUtYW41MTUtNTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Acer Nitro 5 (AN515-54) review,"Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.

Acer Nitro 5 (AN515-54) specs Price: $999

CPU: Intel Core i7-9750H

GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060

RAM: 16GB

Storage: 256GB SSD

Display: 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 144Hz

Battery: 7:06

Size: 14.3 x 10 x 1.0 inches

Weight: 4.85 pounds

The Acer Nitro 5 a budget gaming laptop under $1000 is a carefully curated rig that makes the right concessions to attract bargain-hunting gamers. Acer wanted to offer consumers a decent graphics card at a wallet-friendly price so it sacrificed a premium build quality and a bright colorful display to make room for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU.

The Nitro 5 isn’t for bougie gamers — I’m talking to you pretentious players who wouldn’t touch an all-plastic laptop with a ten-foot pole fancy folk who believe dim displays are for peasants and CPU snobs who only use the latest processors. These types would balk at the thought of using this gaming rig. This Acer laptop is for down-to-earth gamers who are willing to accept a few trade-offs in favor of a better discrete graphics card.

If you turn your nose up at lackluster screens odd keyboard layouts and cheaply built gaming rigs you may not be satisfied with the Nitro 5. However if you’re a sucker for crimson-and-onyx motifs impressive mid-range GPUs and decent VR performance at an affordable price the Nitro 5 is an excellent choice.

Acer Nitro 5 price and configuration options

The Acer Nitro 5 starts at $829.99 and comes with a quad-core Intel Core i5-10300H CPU an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti GPU with 4GB of VRAM 8GB of RAM a 256GB NVMe SSD and a 15.6-inch 144Hz display.

My review model costs $999 and comes with the same storage and display but swaps out the processor graphics and memory for a hexa-core Intel Core i7-9750H CPU an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 6GB of VRAM and 16GB of RAM respectively.

Acer Nitro 5 design

The Acer Nitro 5 looks like it’s been ripped from Optimus Prime’s robotic build and welded into a badass gaming rig with an eye-catching red-and-black motif. A glossy but subtle Acer logo sits in the center of the onyx-coated lid. The lid features two textures: a smooth fingerprint-attracting black center flanked by a funky hexagonal-pattern design.

An attractive red hinge with the word “Nitro” connects the display to the deck. Acer adorns the Nitro 5 with red-trim accents around the keyboard keys and touchpad. The Nitro 5’s chassis is made out of plastic — and it shows. If you press down on the lid you’ll notice some flex and a lack of sturdiness. The palm rest is more solid than the lid but certainly still feels cheap. One of the trade-offs you’ll make with this budget gaming laptop is build quality.

Acer tries to distract you from the display’s ultra-thick bezels with visually pleasing bevel-edge corners but there’s no ignoring the Nitro 5’s chunky frames. The gigantic chin is the largest bezel sporting a glossy Acer logo. The Nitro 5 has four rubber feet on each corner making room for a large edge-to-edge ventilation grill.

At 4.9 pounds and 14.3 x 10 x 1 inches the Acer Nitro 5 is lighter than its three budget gaming rivals: the Asus ROG Strix G15 (5.3 pounds 14.2 x 10.8 x 1 inches) Dell G5 15 SE (5.5 pounds 14.4 x 10 x 0.9 inches) and the Lenovo Legion 5 (5.4 pounds 14.3 x 10 x 0.9 inches).

Acer Nitro 5 ports

The Acer Nitro 5 has an OK stock of ports .

On the left side you’ll find a Kensington lock slot  an RJ45 Ethernet port an HDMI 2.0 port a USB Type-C port and two USB Type-A ports . On the right side you’ll discover a headset jack and another USB Type-A port.

The Nitro 5 does not have Thunderbolt 3 support a microSD card slot nor a mini DisplayPort. If you need more ports we recommend checking out our best laptop docking stations and best USB Type-C hubs pages.

Acer Nitro 5 display

The Nitro’s 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080-pixel display looked surprisingly sharp and detailed as I watched The Mauritanian trailer on YouTube. I could spot every wrinkle and pore on Benedict Cumberbatch’s face. I could make out the cute tiny freckles that populate Shailene Woodley’s cheeks. However Jodie Foster’s striking blue eyes and red lips could have been bolder and more vivid on the Nitro 5’s display. Still the Acer laptop offers a satisfactory visual experience.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

I played Hitman 2 navigating through a Colombian jungle to take down a drug cartel. I loved how the display accurately showed Agent 47’s transition from the muggy wilderness — cloudy with a misty haze — to a less humid environment with muddy streets and run-down brick homes. Of course being that the Nitro 5 is equipped with a 1080p screen it won’t win any awards but I was pleased with the game’s visuals on Nitro 5’s IPS display.

I hope you don’t sit near a bright window — Nitro 5 is pretty darn dim. The Acer laptop’s display emanates only 245 nits of brightness  which is dimmer than the average budget gaming laptop (271 nits). The ROG Strix G15 (251 nits) G5 15 SE (301 nits) and Legion 5 (287 nits) are all brighter than the Nitro 5 but not by much.

The Nitro 5 also covers 45% of the DCI-P3 color gamut which is eight percentage points less than the 53% category average. The ROG Strix G15 covers 1% more of the DCI-P3 color space than the Nitro 5 (46%). The G5 15 SE takes the crown as having the most colorful display (77%). The Legion 5 fares the worst with an embarrassing color-coverage score of 40%.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

With a Delta-E score of 0.33 the Nitro 5 is less color accurate than the 0.3 score of the average budget laptop (the closer the score is to zero the better). The Nitro 5 is also less color accurate than the G5 15 SE and Legion 5 which share a Delta-E score of 0.26 but the Acer gaming rig defeated the ROG Strix G15’s score by a hair (0.34).

Acer Nitro 5 keyboard and touchpad

Meh! I’m not a big fan of the Nitro 5’s less-than-impressive keyboard. But admittedly it has some positive aspects so let’s start there. The oft-used keys in PC gaming (i.e. the W A S D and arrow keys) are outlined with a thick red trim to help them stand out on the keyboard. There is one additional key outlined in red: a dedicated “N” key located within the top-left corner of the full-sized numpad to quick-launch the NitroSense app for fan control.

The keyboard’s island-style red-and-black color scheme panders to my personal tastes — I have a weakness for crimson-and-onyx motifs. I even love the red backlighting which has four brightness tiers. Unfortunately if you’re not a fan of red-backlit keys you’ll be disappointed to know that the Nitro 5 doesn’t feature customizable RGB-key lighting so you’re stuck with red. You can always turn off the red backlight but the dark-red symbols superimposed on black keys are a tad difficult to see.

While I love how the keyboard looks I cannot stand how it feels. I hated typing on this laptop so much I angrily gave up on it while typing this review in Google Docs . I scored 84 words per minute on the 10fastfingers.com typing test which is a slight regression from my typical 85-wpm typing speed. One of the Nitro 5’s biggest offenses is its shortened Shift key — an issue I addressed in 2020 laptop trends that must die . Capitalizing letters is a pain in the rear; instead of landing on the Shift key I often ended up on the up-arrow key which sent the blinking text cursor flying to another paragraph. Another gripe I have with the Nitro 5 keyboard is its poorly placed power button — I am not a fan of power buttons integrated into the keyboard sorry.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

The Nitro 5’s 4.2 x 3.1-inch touchpad is fine offering a satisfactory clicking experience. It’s also responsive to Windows 10 gestures  like two-finger scrolling and three-finger tabbing. However when I don’t have a gaming mouse handy I prefer touchpads with dedicated left-and-right buttons. While playing Dishonored 2 I found myself landing on the wrong side of the touchpad causing me to accidentally fire my pistol and alert nearby enemies of my presence. I had to run for my life — so much for stealth gameplay.

Acer Nitro 5 audio

The dual speakers tuned by Waves MaxxAudio are on the left and right corners of the bottom chassis. I played Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas” on Spotify and wished the sound was slightly louder — the Christmas classic didn’t fill my large testing room.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

The holiday jingle sounded a bit flat and congested as it emanated from the oddly placed bottom-firing speakers. There is a Waves Maxx Audio app to tweak the audio to your liking. There are several presets including Gaming General Gaming FPS Gaming Sports Movies Music and Voice. I played around with all six profiles — none of the presets enhanced the audio but the Gaming Sports profile sounded the worst adding too much grit and rasp to the smooth-sounding holiday jam.

While playing Dishonored 2 on the Nitro 5 I preferred the Gaming General preset which provided well-balanced sound for both the characters’ voices and the background music. Dishonored 2 is one of those games where you’ll need to rely on sound to detect whether an enemy is nearby and of course being that the Nitro 5 is a budget gaming laptop it won’t offer a surround-sound experience. Overall the speakers are simply OK.

Acer Nitro 5 gaming graphics and VR

The Nitro 5’s graphics are powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 2060 GPU and 6GB of VRAM  which is a great graphical engine for a budget gaming laptop.

Cranking up the graphics settings to Ultra I crept through a beautiful abandoned mansion in a fantasized English city in Dishonored 2. I loved that I could make out the different textures in the mansion from a wooden ceiling fan to the off-white marble floors. I could also spot some nifty ray-tracing details including a soft realistic glow from a leather chair located near a light source and a bright glare from a painting placed inside a glass frame.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

On the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark (Highest 1080p) the Nitro 5 hovered around 52 frames per second which outpaced the budget gaming laptop average (36 fps). The ROG Strix G15 powered by an Nvidia GeForce RTX 1650 Ti GPU  fell short against the Nitro 5 (40 fps). The G5 15 SE armed with an AMD Radeon RX 5600M GPU also fell short of the Acer gaming rig (45 fps). The Nitro 5 finally met its match with the Legion 5. Powered by a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti  the Lenovo laptop offered the same score as the Acer laptop (52 fps).

The Nitro 5 averaged 67 frames per second on the Grand Theft Auto V benchmark (Very High 1080p) which crushed the 48-fps category average. The ROG Strix G15 could only muster 44 fps. The G5 15 SE and the Legion 5 also failed to reach the Nitro 5’s glory with just 56 and 64 fps respectively.

On the Metro Exodus benchmark (Ultra 1080p) the Nitro 5 climbed to 47 fps beating the 36-fps category average. The ROG Strix G15 only offered 30 fps. The G5 15 and the Legion 5 came close to the Nitro 5 with 46 fps and 42 fps respectively but the Dell and the Lenovo laptops couldn’t surpass Acer.

When we ran 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra the Nitro 5 (3696) crushed the category average (2919) the ROG Strix G15 (2197) and the Legion 5 (3180) but the G5 15 SE killed the Acer’s winning streak with a knock-out score of 4360.

If you’re wondering whether the Nitro 5 can handle VR you’ll be happy to know that the Acer gaming rig slew the VRMark Orange Room benchmark with a score of 7116 sailing past the average budget gaming laptop (5415). The Nitro 5 also defeated the ROG Strix G15 (5259) the G5 15 SE (7237) and the Legion 5 (5013).

Acer Nitro 5 performance

The Nitro 5 packs 16GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7-9750H CPU (a mid-tier processor that is a generation behind as of this writing). The Acer laptop managed to juggle 45 Google Chrome tabs and three YouTube videos without a hitch.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

Despite its obsolete CPU the Nitro 5 served up a score of 5435 which beats the category average (4696) and the Core i7-10750H processors inside both the ROG Strix G15 (5168) and the Legion 5 (5325). However the Nitro 5 couldn’t keep up with G5 15 SE’s AMD Ryzen R7 4800H CPU which outputted a spectacular score of 7715.

The Nitro 5 took 11 minutes and 41 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p on our HandBrake benchmark failing to surpass the category average (11:25). The ROG Strix G15 (10:28) G5 15 SE (6:43) and Legion 5 (10:05) were quicker than the Acer gaming rig.

When we ran the file transfer test the Nitro 5’s 256GB SSD duplicated 4.97GB of multimedia files in 18 seconds at a transfer rate of 301 megabytes per second. This is a tinge faster than the category average (285 MBps). The Nitro 5 also beat the 512GB SSDs inside the ROG Strix G15 (129 MBps) and the Legion 5 (200 MBps). However the Acer laptop couldn’t keep up with the G5 15 SE (452 MBps) which also sports a 512GB SSD.

Acer Nitro 5 battery life

The Nitro 5 has decent battery life for a budget gaming laptop.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

The Acer gaming rig lasted 7 hours and 6 minutes on the Laptop Mag battery test (continuous surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness) which outlasted the average budget gaming laptop (6:56). The Nitro 5 also has more endurance than the ROG Strix G15 (5:11). The G5 15 SE (7:14) and the Legion 5 (7:13) lasted 8 minutes and 7 minutes longer than the Nitro 5 respectively.

Acer Nitro 5 camera

On the top bezel of the Nitro 5 is a 1280 x 720-pixel camera that is as grainy as an ‘80s homemade video.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

This camera looks like a visual sprite displaying fizz via its overwhelming video noise. The webcam could not capture the individual strands of my frizzy hair that was pulled up into a bun looking like a messy blob. My brown complexion appeared to have odd green undertones. If you plan on broadcasting your gameplay on Twitch or YouTube this webcam will stifle your streaming career. Check out our best webcams page for cameras with better video quality.

Acer Nitro 5 heat

After gaming for 15 minutes the Nitro 5’s underside reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit which is slightly above our 95-degree comfort threshold. The center of the keyboard and touchpad hit 107 and 77 degrees respectively. The hottest location of the laptop is the underside near the vents which climbed to 119 degrees.

Acer Nitro 5 (Image credit: Future)

After playing a 15-minute 1080p YouTube video the Nitro 5 remained relatively cool under the hood showing off the advantage of its plastic chassis. The Acer laptop’s center (88 degrees) touchpad (76 degrees) and underside (87 degrees) all hovered below the 95-degree comfort threshold. Again the hottest location was the underside (near the vents) reaching 91 degrees.

Acer Nitro 5 software and warranty

The Nitro 5 features the NitroSense app which allows you to monitor and manage the laptop’s performance battery and fans.

You’ll also find Acer properties such as Acer Product Registration which offers discounts and exclusive offers Acer Collection S an app store and Acer Care Center a platform that runs system updates tuneups and diagnostics.

You’ll discover some typical Windows 10 bloatware apps  including Candy Crush Friends and Farm Heroes Saga.

The Nitro 5 comes with a one-year limited warranty. See how Acer performed on our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Laptop Brands .

Bottom line

The Acer Nitro 5 is a solid budget gaming laptop with competition-beating frame rates and VR score. However there is one laptop that consistently kept outperforming the Nitro 5 during our testing: the Dell G5 15 SE .

The $829 G5 15 SE kicked the $999 Nitro 5’s butt. The AMD-equipped Dell gaming rig sports a punchier display more storage zippier file-transfer and video-editing rates and better overall performance.

On the plus side the Nitro 5 crushed the G5 15 SE — and its other rivals — when it comes to gaming frame rates offering an average of nine more frames than the Dell laptop. It also surpassed all of its competitors on the VRMark Orange Room benchmark.

If decent VR performance and higher frame rates appeal to you get the Nitro 5 but if you prefer a better display a blisteringly fast CPU and more storage at a sub-$1000 price tag the G5 15 SE is the better option.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS10cmV0aXJlLWtlcGxlci1ncHUtYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlLWdlZm9yY2UtZ3R4LTYwMC03MDAtc2VyaWVzLXI0NzAtZHJpdmVycy_SAWhodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9udmlkaWEtdHJldGlyZS1rZXBsZXItZ3B1LWFyY2hpdGVjdHVyZS1nZWZvcmNlLWd0eC02MDAtNzAwLXNlcmllcy1yNDcwLWRyaXZlcnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA To Retire Its Kepler GPU Architecture ‘GeForce 600 / 700 Series’ With R470 Drivers,"NVIDIA is going to retire its Kepler GPU architecture which has been supported since 2012 with the release of its R470 series drivers.

NVIDIA Kepler GPU Architecture To See Its Retirement With R470 GeForce Drivers

As reported by Phoronix the NVIDIA R470 series drivers are labeled as LTSB (Long-Term Support) for the Kepler GPU series and as such will maintain support for the said architecture for 3 years after which it would be retired along with the GPUs. The NVIDIA Kepler GPU architecture has been supported for generations but as time goes by older GPU architectures are removed from official support lists.

NVIDIA ended driver support for its Fermi (GeForce 400 / 500 Series) back in 2018 moving it to legacy status. The same is expected to happen with the Kepler-based GeForce 600 / 700 series when NVIDIA moves beyond R470 drivers. The last DRV drivers (regular driver release branch) are going to ship for the next few months before a new driver/feature brand is introduced & support finally ends for the Kepler generation.

Looking back at Kepler the GPU architecture brought NVIDIA back in the fight with mainstream chips competing against flagship parts from AMD. NVIDIA also focused a lot on efficiency which made it win in latter generations such as Maxwell and Pascal. The Kepler series did take a huge blow when AMD fired back with its Hawaii GPUs in 2013 but lept back in the game with Maxwell a year later. The following chart from NVIDIA shows the CUDA and driver support plan for current GPU architectures:

While these specs are standard fare in most gaming monitors today HP has a few tricks up its sleeves for differentiating the Omen 25i from the majority of the competition. The Omen 25i offers Dynamic Crosshairs that can be customized in 248 ways for optimum visibility and they can automatically switch colors depending on the scene. There's also the Edge Precision feature for enhancing the edges and Shadow Vision to bring out details in darker areas of the scene without overexposing the brighter ones.

HP said that the Omen 25i is the world's first monitor with a built-in Game Remastered mode. Game Remastered applies added color saturation and adaptive sharpening filters to lower resolution old school PC and console games to make them look better. All these features can be accessed and controlled via the Omen Gaming Hub.

The HP Omen 25i gaming monitor will be available in July for a starting price of US$349.99.

Middle school counselor Mady Horn and high school business teacher Amy Craghead presented on behalf of the committee.

Horn shared anonymous comments from a salary survey with board members. She noted while many of the teachers enjoyed working at North Callaway some had to work side jobs to make ends meet due to low pay and most were concerned with the lack of competitive salaries with other school districts in the area.

""If people are looking at leaving they're looking at leaving because of salary"" Horn said. ""A lot of these comments do seem negative but these people like teaching here and it's where they want to be.""

Horn and Craghead explained the committee's recommendations to the board include extending the steps on the salary schedule to 33 years increase base pay by $1500 and also increase the step increments to $500 a year and $1000 a year for teachers entering their 10th 20th and 30th years with the district.

""The reality is the proposals we are making are not going to impact things immediately"" Horn said. ""We want to give (teachers) something to look forward to.""

In other new business Thursday night board members unanimously voted to accept three bids for a project and two services. The first was a bid of $329250 from Missouri Builders for the high school roof.

The board also approved a bid for trash pickup from Republic Services for $620 a month starting July 1. Board members then gave their OK to a bid from Atkins - the district's current vendor - for $471 a month for pest control.

The board unanimously approved two resolutions on L.J. Hart and Co. prepayment options. The first authorized the redemption of $200000 principal amount of general obligation funds Series 2015 and authorizing the publication of notice of redemption.

The second resolution authorized the redemption of $540000 principal amount of general obligation refunding bonds Series 2017 and authorizing the publication of notice of redemption.

The board on Thursday night honored high school physical education teacher and head football coach Don Boulware who is retiring at the end of the school year. Boulware - a 1973 North Callaway graduate - spent 27 years in education.

""I haven't met a guy who has a better heart than Don Boulware - he cares about kids"" High School Principal Brian Jobe said. ""I would challenge anyone to say otherwise.""

At the corner of Simcoe and Verdun streets sits the second-oldest grocery store in Lafayette.

Guidroz Food Center has a butcher's section with a line of people wrapped around the interior waiting to buy boudin or a plate lunch. A few aisles with rice and canned goods fill the inside and in the corner a handful of fresh produce.

The area where Guidroz supplies groceries is a food desert — defined as ""neighborhoods that lack healthy food sources"" according to U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Guidroz Food Center opened in 1959. Guidroz butcher Terry Bueas 68 grew up in north Lafayette during this time. He's watched new life be introduced and smothered out over the years.

A butcher for almost 50 years Guidroz Food Center helped Bueas keep a job in his neighborhood after the Winn-Dixie closed about seven years ago. With the closure of most grocery stores in his neighborhoods he's seen an increase of people coming to Guidroz.

""This is my own neighborhood"" he said with a smile on his face. ""It’s changed a lot. There’s growth here — in the store in the neighborhood with more people.""

The neighborhood store recently got a grant from McComb-Veazey Community House to expand its produce section.

McComb-Veazey Community House an organization and farm in north Lafayette through its partnership with Habitat for Humanity received $85000 from Republic services to invest in four businesses — Guidroz Food Center Northside Vegan Nina Creole and Black Cafe.

The influx of support for local grocers and restaurants is in response to the pervasive food desert in north Lafayette. However the closure of grocery stores in predominately Black neighborhoods was a decades-old issue the community has faced due to local government traffic plans and disinvestment in growth.

Structural segregation laid out in the 1960s led to corrosive inequality in food available and life-elevation opportunities in north Lafayette.

'These highways effectively serve as moats'

Generations have seen their north Lafayette neighborhoods emptied. The first transportation scar was the railroad. The Evangeline Thruway again bisected and economically starved the communities it ran through.

The opening of Guidroz Food Center was closely followed by the Evangeline Thruway being identified for possible upgrading to interstate standards in 1968. In 1987 the Interstate 49 connector received congressional authorization and funding.

Any hesitancy to develop on the northside was now permanent. The initial 1990 plan had the six-lane connector run roughly along the same route as the thruway. A route in 2015 proposed having the 5.5-mile corridor loom overpopulated parts downtown past St. Genevieve Catholic Church through the LaPlace McComb-Veazey and Freetown neighborhoods to end up near the Lafayette airport.

The 2015 Evangeline Corridor Initiative suggested ""redesigning"" Super 1 now one of the few grocery stores within two miles of LaPlace McComb-Veazey and Freetown neighborhoods and replacing it with ""new commercial amenities"" that ""spurs higher economic return on investment opportunities.""

In a 2016 Daily Advertiser article opponents of the connector said ""the same logic that divided the community with construction of Evangeline Thruway in the 1960s is being used to push the I-49 connector through the heart of the city.""

Those feelings have been exacerbated as stores job opportunities and quality of life are bled from the area.

""In a lot of ways we build these highways that effectively serve as moats"" Kevin Blanchard executive director of the Lafayette Public Trust Financing Authority working to combat the disinvestment in north Lafayette said. ""That's led to this giant emptying out. So much uncertainty for so long where people aren't sure like 'Should we be putting money into this place or not? What will it look like in five years?'""

North Lafayette's food desert years in the making

The visual impacts of the disinvestment started with Piggly Wiggly in the early 2000s.

""It was triggered really by the Piggly Wiggly closing before the Albertson’s"" Tina Bingham executive director for the McComb-Veazey neighborhood said. ""Where there was a Piggly Wiggly there's a beauty supply shop now. So you can go and get beautiful hair weaves and everything but you can't get any meat fresh produce or anything.""

Tina Bingham - McComb-Veazey Homegrowers Community Garden. Friday May 14 2021. SCOTT CLAUSE/USA TODAY Network

Then Albertsons closed Feb. 2012 with company officials stating the location could not make enough of a profit to be sustainable according to a 2014 Advertiser article. The location is now Willow Charter Academy at Northgate Mall.

Then Walmart closed its doors in March 2019 — now going to be Completeful a shipping fulfillment service.

The latest to fall is Shoppers Value at Four Corners in Feb. 2020 which replaced the Winn-Dixie and before that it was Piggly Wiggly the first store to close.



Lafayette Public Trust Financing Authority created a map showing the grocery stores closed in Lafayette and the areas impacted.

Now the areas north of University Ave are stuck in the food desert cycle. The grocery store closing is a disparaging catalyst.

The first ripple of food concerns occurred when Albertson's closed. Residents began wondering where they were supposed to get their groceries. Compounding factors of time income and transportation led people to turn to corner stores for answers Bingham said.

""We start looking at the convenience stores like 'So where are the groceries in here?' And then you see that there's no real access to anything"" Bingham said. ""People are buying junk food with food stamps just to feed their family because they don't have transportation. Or they don't have the time. They’re going between jobs and they don't have transportation. So it’s like 'Do I get my taxi driver to stop at Walmart or take me to work so that I can pay the bills to get back home?' There's all these decisions that people are juggling.""

When documenting food deserts the USDA takes into consideration three main characteristics: income level distance to supermarkets and vehicle access.

The 2019 USDA map of food deserts shows the majority of north Lafayette's population is not within a half-mile of a grocery store or has access to a vehicle — especially daunting considering the thruway people have to cross has a high number of fatalities.

This map shows ""low-income census tract where more than 100 housing units do not have a vehicle and are more than 1/2 mile from the nearest supermarket or a significant number or share of residents are more than 20 miles from the nearest supermarket"" highlighted in yellow.

Public transportation gives access to some full-service grocery stores but time spent en route impacts the choices — type of food bought getting a babysitter opting out of a shift at work — customers are forced to make.

Of those living in the census tracts designated as food deserts over half of the residents are racial minorities according to population estimates.

Despite the emptying of stores there hasn't been an emptying of people. Lafayette Public Trust Financing Authority mapped four grocery stores north of University Ave. Below University Ave. is 19 grocery stores.

Scars of Segregation

""Low-income people still eat. Low-income people still need to get groceries"" Blanchard said. ""It's not that there aren't people there the way there were in the past. But it's a lot of the other drivers that when you place up against this longtime environment of disinvestment that it cascades.""

North Lafayette wasn't built on box brand businesses. Mom-and-pop grocery stores like Guidroz Food Center were every few blocks. The small family-owned and run stores were created from community necessity Bingham said.

From her childhood Bingham recalls the neighborhood stores and their sense of community within. Her grandfather owned numerous stores in Fightinville and her father's family along with other families grew produce from their McComb-Veazey backyards.

""My family was always really connected to the land. Always growing different things"" she said. ""We knew where food was. Food was very accessible. It was more of a community the community really came together.""

But as time went on the corner grocery stores closed. Fewer people had jobs that allow for discretionary spending. Residents weren't able to give back to their local businesses having to travel to cheaper large brands to get essential items bypassing their neighborhood convenience store.

With just a handful of scattered grocery stores on the north side of Lafayette residents are leaving their communities to get essential items causing an investment vacuum.

""When they walk to work they don’t have to leave the community. You see more of that money cycling and recycling back into the community. All of our money leaves the community even the stores. All of that leaves our community"" Bingham said. "" ... And as long as we keep driving over there we'll never see any of that stuff happening here.""

'We have a major problem'

The historic disinvestment on the north side of Lafayette is not new. It's talked about in local government and organizations. But creating change with those talks rarely happens Bingham said.

""I think we have a lot of conversations in Lafayette. We have a lot of plans but we don't have a lot of action that comes along with those plans or capital dollars and investments to go along with those plans too"" Bingham said. ""So I like to see something that will actually come into some kind of action. Not just a catalyst for the sake of being a catalyst. A catalyst that really is impacting the community that we can start moving forward in the near near future.""

Bingham has formed one of those catalysts with McComb-Veazey Community House. She created it in 2019 after noticing the food desert wrapping its treacherous fingers around her home.

Her first step was feeding people in her community with her garden. The garden quickly graduated to a community farm now supplies a bi-monthly market and generates income.

""We're just trying to use food in different ways to activate the community and conversation active new business and entrepreneurship and just help to rebuild our food system"" Bingham said.

McComb-Veazey Community House also acts as a ""living room"" where the community gathers to reconnect and preserve McComb-Veazey — one of the oldest neighborhoods in Lafayette — where generations have been raised and reside.

There's no shortage of plans coming from within communities in north Lafayette. But the northside lacks funding. While waiting for capital developers or city development comes in and wipes away a community's plans for something the developers can afford instantly not taking into consideration what the area has been working on or needs.

""We want to start getting ahead of the curve"" Bingham said. ""We've been very reactive … to a lot of things that were happening within our community. And the only way to flip that is for us to be more proactive and for us to say ... 'Where are we going to go up from this?' You can't keep spiraling back down. So let's put a pin on some of the things that we know isn't really healthy and benefiting us and say 'How do we start getting to the next step?'""

Kevin Blanchard is the new chief development officer of the Lafayette Consolidated Government. Paul Kieu The Advertiser

Lafayette Public Trust Financing Authority is working to ensure capital investments that are supportive of community efforts in traditionally underserved areas. The big picture Blanchard said is lowering the number of people identified in the census tracts as low income or low access by a third in the next five years.

The trust through a recent fellowship plans on prebaking solutions for north Lafayette by forming a pipeline of deals for capital investment. The group is not going to build a grocery store clap and walk away Blanchard said.

""You don't get to a problem like this overnight. And it's not just one thing. And there's not just one fix"" Blanchard said. "" ... We have a major problem. Half of the city is in a food desert. So like how do we start to address that ... because this is a really good example of what happens when you're not making investments.""

Resources are the only way to fix it Bingham said. Communities can have ideas for every block of their neighborhood but without resources and allies that push purposefully disadvantaged areas into conversations onto policy levels north Lafayette will be left ""spinning and not going nowhere.""

Not conscious thought anyway. In those moments when he has the ball at his feet and the goal in his sights even after all these years even when he can lay claim to being the most complete most ruthless most polished striker of his generation he is not thinking.

Or more to the point: He is not aware of himself thinking. He is not weighing options rifling through possibilities selecting the best of them. Thinking takes time and there is no time. “There is not even half a second to think about what to do or how to do it” he said.

And yet he is thinking. Or more to the point: He is learning. He is absorbing information analyzing it filing it away.

There was a moment in his game for Bayern Munich against Borussia Dortmund in March when the ball fell to Lewandowski on the edge of the penalty area. He took a touch and a shot. It was not by his own admission “perfect.” His effort flew over the crossbar. Lewandowski turned away in disappointment ruing an opportunity wasted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy91dGFoLWF0dG9ybmV5LXJvYmVydC1qLWRlYnJ5LWRpZXMtYXQtODUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah Attorney Robert J.

The Poland striker is already second on the all-time scorers list in the Bundesliga with 277 goals now behind only Mueller’s 365. Mueller set the previous record in the 1971/72 season with 40 goals which Lewandowski equalled last week.

Lewandowski missed more than half a dozen clear scoring chances in the game and looked set to miss out on the record with Augsburg determined not to let him add to his tally and snatch the record away from Mueller a youth idol of Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl.

But the Pole was not to be denied and in the final minute when keeper Rafal Gikiewicz spilled a Leroy Sane shot the forward rounded the keeper to score.

With coach Hansi Flick and several players of the old guard — Javi Martinez David Alaba and Jerome Boateng — bidding farewell to the club and 250 invited fans in the 75000-seat arena it was an emotional afternoon for Bayern with the championship long wrapped up.

It did not take long for the hosts to take the lead with Augsburg’s Jeffrey Gouweleeuw stabbing the ball into his own net from a Serge Gnabry cutback in the ninth minute. Gnabry then headed in their second goal in the 23rd after Gikiewicz had saved a point blank effort by Lewandowski.

A minute later Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer denied Daniel Caligiuri from the penalty spot before Joshua Kimmich launched a 20-metre missile to make it 3-0 for the hosts.

Kingsley Coman also got onto the scoresheet scoring two minutes before the break with his low crisp shot whizzing past Gikiewicz.The visitors came to life midway through the second half scoring twice with Andre Hahn and Florian Niederlechner. But it was Lewandowski who had the last say.

X’s half-brother Corey Pack filed the suit against Bernard last week claiming that she has been shuffling money from the estate to multiple shell companies. Pack’s attorney Robert Stok says that the “fraudulent transfer complaint seeks to recover assets being transferred from the probate estate by XXX’s mother Cleo Bernard in order to deprive our client Corey Pack of a recovery if he’s successful in his efforts to secure his inheritance rights either under his late brother’s trust or will.”

According to the lawsuit Brown has a 50 percent stake in the estate while Pack and another of X’s half-brothers have only 25 percent interest.

This lawsuit is the second of its kind in a matter of months. Bernard was sued back in June by Pack’s mother Jodi Kavney who says that her son was entitled to a fair share of XXXTentacion’s estate. Kavney noted that an alleged deal made with the mother of XXX’s son pushed Pack out of the estate. She was hoping to recover assets she said were “improperly and surreptitiously transferred.”

XXXTentacion’s estate is valued at over $50 million though the new lawsuit does not detail how much money his mother was hiding. Bernard has denied all allegations.

The move signals the return of a significant slice of downtown Seattle’s economy where some waterfront businesses plan staffing around the cruise schedule. But significant questions remain about exact safety protocols the cruise lines will enforce.

Princess Cruises Holland America Line and Carnival Cruise Line said Thursday they would resume cruising to Alaska for a partial season starting in July for passengers who have proof of vaccination.

Princess Cruises will sail seven-day cruises from July 25 through Sept. 26. Sales will begin on May 21.

Holland America Line will resume seven-day cruises to depart on Saturdays from July 24 through Oct. 2.

Carnival will depart weekly from July 27 to Sept. 14. Most trips will be seven-day cruises with one eight-day trip that has one additional stop.

Norwegian Cruise Line has also started selling tickets for August sailings from Seattle to Alaska the Associated Press reported Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Royal Caribbean Group which includes Royal Caribbean Celebrity Cruises and Silversea said the company would release more details soon but “we couldn’t be more excited to sail in Alaska this summer.”

Proof of vaccination will be required the companies said Thursday. Decisions about masks social distancing and precise quarantine procedures are still to come.

Cruise ships became early emblems of the pandemic when outbreaks aboard ships last year stranded crews and passengers on board for weeks. This spring the CDC has been working on guidelines to allow cruise ships to resume operations.

For Seattle-Alaska sailings the Port of Seattle will craft agreements with the cruise companies outlining safety protocols including arrangements in the event of an outbreak on board “so it’s not a burden on the local government and community resources” said Stephanie Jones Stebbins the Port of Seattle’s maritime director.

The resumption of sailing is made possible by the recent passage of the Alaska Tourism Restoration Act which will temporarily allow cruise lines to bypass Canada.

Many large cruise lines run ships that are registered outside the United States and because of that are typically required to stop at a foreign port when traveling between two U.S. ports. (Cruise critics say the companies register outside the country to avoid taxes labor laws and environmental regulations.) With Canada closed to cruise ships that rule stood in the way of Seattle-to-Alaska trips.

After passage in the U.S. Senate last week the U.S. House of Representatives approved the fix Thursday. The news set off a string of cruise lines announcing their plans to resume sailing to Alaska.

The return of cruises marks a sea change after a year of pandemic shutdowns.

“It’s a really important step toward the economic recovery of our region. So many people’s livelihoods depend on tourism and the cruise business” said the Port’s Jones Stebbins.

Before the pandemic shutdown the cruise industry was credited with generating about $894 million in local revenue and contributing to 5500 jobs each season according to estimates.

“Awesome!” exclaimed Erin Andrews when informed of the announcement Thursday.

Andrews who owns indi chocolate in Pike Place Market said cruise passengers who stop in to shop or take chocolate classes are “really significant to our business.”

“We definitely felt the impact of not having the cruises come through” she said. “It was part of the impact of COVID.”

Not everyone will welcome the return. Cruises have been a flashpoint for environmental concerns in Seattle.

“We realize we need to reduce our use of fossil fuels and need to do so quickly. After a break like we’ve had to jump back into a leisure activity that is so fossil-fuel intensive… does seem like going backwards” said Stacy Oaks a member of Seattle Cruise Control a coalition opposing a new cruise terminal in Pioneer Square. “Unfortunately we didn’t get to use this pause to think about how we could have more responsible tourism.”

The Port has pointed to its plan to provide cruise ships with shore power to allow them to turn off diesel engines at the dock. The new terminal was delayed last year when the pandemic took a bit out of the Port’s budget.

The federal bill allowing cruise lines to bypass foreign ports Oaks said “doesn’t seem like it benefits people as much as cruise companies.”

The cruise lines did not immediately provide details of their hiring plans for the new season which will be shorter than a typical summer cruise season in Seattle.

Beyond requiring passengers to be fully vaccinated the companies are still working through final coronavirus protocols with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Holland America Line President Gus Antorcha.

“My hope is it will be very close to what people remember in terms of their experience on board” Antorcha said.

Crewmembers working aboard Holland America ships will be required to be vaccinated he said.

Carnival Corp. which owns Princess Holland and Carnival said it would provide customers “advanced detailed information about protocols in place at the time of departure as full details continue to be updated in collaboration with medical and science experts and government authorities.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1L2hlcmUtYXJlLXRoZS1jcnVpc2UtbGluZXMtYWN0dWFsbHktb3BlcmF0aW5nLXJpZ2h0LW5vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here Are The Cruise Lines Actually Operating Right Now,"With many cruise lines announcing start ups this spring and summer a number of lines are already back in service.

During a recent stand-up show a comedian roasted an audience member who reported working for the Biden administration.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

On that day ""a configuration change was made as an emergency fix at the network tier which was designed to address a functional gap in preparation for an upcoming maintenance activity"" Salesforce said.

Salesforce use the Berkely Internet Name Daemon (BIND) software.

A change was made to enable DNS resolution between an existing Salesforce Australia data centre and a new Hyperforce environment set to undergo maintenance using a script.

The script which Salesforce says has been used in the past three years without ill effects used an internal method called Metazone change.

This deploys new configuration data through a DNS zone transfer but in the May 12 incident the script did not behave as expected.

A UNIX operating system KILL command did not wait long for the BIND named process to exit cleanly or to remove a process identification (PID) file.

On restart the named startup script checks for an existing PID to determine if an instance is already running.

If the script finds a PID file it exits immediately and as a result the named DNS server process did not restart.

Salesforce said the script failure had global impact because the Metazone changes were deployed to named servers across all its data centres worldwide.

Many named services failed to restart causing widespread disruption for Salesforce customers.

A lack of automation with safeguards for DNS changes to protect against unforeseen incidents was a contributing factor for the outage along with insufficient guardrails to enforce the change management process.

Saleforce's Sales Service Marketing Commerce Government and Experience Clouds all became inaccessible for users along with Heroku Pardot and Industries.

Adding to Salesforce customers' woes the status.salesforce.com site experienced such high traffic that it too became unavailable.

Customers were also unable to log support cases due to multi-factor authentication problems.

Salesforce has apologised for the outage and has put a moratorium in place for all DNS change across the company.

The script that triggered the outage has also been removed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYnJpZGdlLmpwL2VuLzIwMjEvMDUvc2VjYWktbWFyY2hlLWpweTE1MG0tZnVuZGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Secai Marche nabs $1.4M to extend food supply chain connecting farmers with F&B in Asia,"In 2020 startup investment in Brazil reached US$3.5 billion up 30% from the previous year while the number of unicorns in 2020 increased by 3 to 14. Meanwhile that in Japan reached US$4.32 billion and the number of unicorns increased by Spider alone to 7 during the same period. This indicates that Brazil has produced unicorns at about twice the rate of Japan so far and last year despite having experienced one of the worst pandemic situation in the world.

Mitsuru Nakayama founder and CEO of Brazil Venture Capital (BVC) has been forced to stay inside Japan due to the pandemic but been busy to remotely support startups which are typically located on the other sdide of the planet. Thanks to the efforts of newly joined partners and associates in Brazil and Peru the firm’s investment activities are keeping going well. BVC announced its second fund with a targeted final size of 1 billion yen in December and has reached its first close and disclosed the names of their investors and two invested startups.

Most of the fund’s investors are angels in Japan as follows (except for those who don’t want to be named):

Shintaro Okuno — Managing Partner and Head of Tokyo Bain & Company

Haruo Amano — Executive Vice President Hennge

Soki Ohmae — Co-Founder and Representative Partner Drone Fund

Ken Soga — President SGcapital

Shota Kawaminami — Executive Officer HENNGE

Tatsuya Matsuoka — President Japan Medical Support Institute

Second Fund’s portfolio 1: Digital Restaurants sees a spree.

In late April Europe-based Taster announced it has secured 27 million euros. The startup wants to call themselves a digital restaurant brand rather than a ghost restaurant or a cloud kitchen operator because they dare not just providing cooking resources behind third-party brands but trying to build new brands themselves. The sales in Paris of Europe’s leading food delivery operator Deliveroo recently showed a consolidation of Taster brands was ranked in third place following McDonald’s and Burger King.

Pedro Neira Ferrand a four-time serial entrepreneur from Peru launched Digital Restaurants. Approved to join renowned entrepreneur support networks like Endeavor and Founders Network he had been running a Latin America-focused dating app called MiMediaManzana (already shut down) prior to the current startup.

Digital Restaurants has partnered with MCK Hospitality an operator behind the Japanese-Peruvian restaurant chain Osaka being operated in major Latin American cities and is now operating several digital restaurant brands like Lucky’s Crispy Chicken Poke for the People and Black Burger. Currently the company is only serving Peru but it may be easier for them to expand into other markets in South America where MCK has been running their operations.

Second Fund’s portfolio 2: Mono is an Colombian answer to neobank.

In our previous interview with Nakayama he said that many local people are experiencing fewer access to financial services in Latin America while financial infrastructure is in place. If any startup can use the infrastructure to provide innovative services which are too cumbersome for conventional banksto provide it could be a huge market out there. One example is ContaSimples an investee from BVC’s first fund. The Brazilian startup currently serves 13000 customers planning to triple it by the end of the year. In late last year they secured a US$2.5 million funding led by Brazil’s FinTech-focused VC firm Quartz.

We can guess that Mono is a Colombian answer to ContaSimples. It’s seeing a high growth by issuing credit cards to entrepreneurs and sole proprietors with no credit history but high demand for card payments in their business. All four of Mono’s founders have previously worked at fintech startups including the two who has been selected in a Y Combinator-qualified startup (tpaga selected for the YC S17 batch).

A growing number of startups from the fintech industry are joining the unicorn club in Latin America including local neobanks like Brazil’s Nubank and Argentina’s Uala we well as payments startups like Uruguay’s dLocal and Mexico’s Clip. What is more many of these unicorns have common in terms of having got SoftBank Vision Fund as an investor. SoftBank tends to invest in the middle or later stage it is interesting to note that BVC is able to reach out to potential unicorns in the early stage.

BVC has also informally agreed with four Brazilian startups to invest in them from its second fund shortly. The first fund launched in August 2016 has invested in 12 companies so far and Nakayama told us that they would see some exits from that portfolio pretty soon. The first fund’s portfolio includes bxblue (automated payroll loans) ContaSimples ARPAC (drone technology for efficient pesticide spraying).

A 148.5-carat Tiffany & Co. aquamarine was part of a prized collection of Tiffany gems and gemstones that was seen by millions of visitors at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair.

In 1894 the entire collection was purchased from Tiffany & Co. for $100000 and donated by Harlow Niles Higinbotham President of the World’s Fair to start Chicago’s premier natural history museum.

In 2009 Tiffany experts set the aquamarine in a platinum and gold brooch embellished with white diamonds and named the piece the “Schlumberger Bow.” Today the company offers jewelry under their Tiffany Schlumberger tradename to clients around the world.

When LVMH the world’s largest luxury group completed its $15.6 billion acquisition of U.S. based global jewelry brand Tiffany & Company in January this year it marked the largest purchase of a luxury company in history. The latest LVMH earnings report emphasizes the importance of this acquisition and highlights the global popularity of the 184-year-old Tiffany & Co. Brand which was founded in 1837. This is no surprise to Chicagoans as Tiffany is a brand that has now been celebrated and formally exhibited in Chicago to millions of viewers for more than 125 years. But we will begin this story in 1889 in Paris France when Tiffany showed a major collection of gems at the Paris Exposition.

Tiffany & Co. Exhibits Around the World

Paris 1889 – At the Paris Exposition of 1889 tens of thousands of visitors flocked to view a remarkable Tiffany & Co. exhibition not previously before seen. After the immense exhibiting success and after the closing of the Paris Exposition it was the goal of Charles Lewis Tiffany founder of the company and his gem and jewelry team to keep this gem collection together for the educational benefit of the greater public. Tiffany a member of the board of the American Museum of Natural History approached a fellow Museum trustee mogul and avid collector James Pierpont Morgan who agreed to buy the collection for $15000 [2] and maintain it. Morgan would eventually donate this group of gems to the American Museum of Natural History as the Tiffany-Morgan Collection where it remains an important component of the collection today.

Chicago 1893 – At the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 a second and equally acclaimed Tiffany gem and jewelry collection was formed and exhibited. The collection was prominently exhibited in the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building at the Chicago World’s Fair and the exhibits again drew great crowds and admiration.

Tiffany received national and international coverage for the collection’s triumphant exhibition at the Chicago World’s Fair. The Jewelers Review a publication from the time wrote in August 1893 regarding the exhibition that “Enthusiasts watching the endless throngs crowding around the Tiffany diamonds at the Fair have declared that were any single exhibit to be chosen for a special grand prize as the greatest international exposition the world has ever seen the Tiffany diamonds would know no rival” [3].

The photo was featured in the article “The Tiffany Exhibit at the World’s Fair” in the publication The Illustrated American issue dated May 20 1893. According to John Loring acclaimed Tiffany & Co. historian the set featured in the photo “contained 147 aquamarines all cut at Tiffany’s gem cutting shop from the same crystal to assure a uniform color and the set also contained 1848 diamonds.” [4]

Again Charles Lewis Tiffany was proud of the tremendous crowds and positive news coverage that his firm experienced in Chicago in 1893. In a brochure published by Tiffany & Co. that year the house declared “The testimonials…from the thousands of daily visitors the almost unlimited generous comments of the press and the valued technical reviews by art writers at home and abroad have all been so overwhelming that the house accepts them not in the spirit of a personal compliment but as a graceful tribute…” [6] The brochure goes on to state what is and was the vision that has resulted in making the Tiffany brand as popular today in the world as any jewelry brand that Tiffany’s aim was “to excel the past and to retain by real merit the approval of the public” [7].

Tiffany was determined to ensure that the public at large would again as in New York continue to have access to the remarkable jewelry and gemstones exhibited in Chicago. As the World’s Fair was ending “prominent Chicagoans wanted to convert the fair’s collection into a permanent natural history museum” [8]. Just a short time after the close of the Fair in October 1893 Harlow Niles Higinbotham agreed to buy the entire Tiffany gem exhibit for the princely price of $100000 [9]. This collection would continue to be permanently exhibited over the next 125 years at the Field Columbian Museum which would later become the Field Museum of Natural History; the collection would grow to include hundreds of specimens.

The acquisition of the Tiffany gems made possible by Higinbotham received national coverage. The New York Times reported at the time that it “forms one of the most interesting exhibits that has been gathered abroad” [10] and that the Higinbotham donation “was one of the most important additions that has been made to the Museum” [11]. The article highlighted standout pieces that were part of the collection including a stunning Sun-God opal which “is carved in such a delicate way to show the face of the Aztec Sun God.” Other highlights that were part of this exhibition and remain exhibited today include a 154-carat beautiful green peridot and a collection of golden yellow sapphires the largest weighing 102.2-carats.

The opal was displayed at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair and is part of the collection that Higinbotham purchased. In addition “this Opal was mined in Mexico by the Aztecs in the sixteenth century and eventually found its way to the Field Museum in 1893 where it has remained ever since.” [12]

With Higinbotham’s funding secured the gems and gemstones did stay in Chicago and were moved to and installed in the new Field Columbian Museum which was housed in the former Palace of Fine Arts Building of the Chicago World’s Fair in Jackson Park. The gems opened at the Field Columbian Museum on June 2nd 1894 where they remained until 1921.

The entire Tiffany-Higinbotham display was moved in 1921 to the new Higinbotham Hall in the current Museum building and completely reinstalled in 1941 with “new and highly improved types of exhibition cases on bases of attractive English harewood with view-glasses supported by framework of bright polished bronze…The reconstructed hall with its colored window of Tiffany glass opposite the entrance provides a setting worthy of the beauty of the gems and other ornamental objects in the collection.” [14]

Higinbotham’s Role and Legacy

Harlow Niles Higinbotham was well-positioned to step up and fund the purchase of the entire collection and thus to make Charles Tiffany’s dream of permanent public access for his achievement a reality. His rise from farm boy to civic leader was very rapid even by the standards of fortune building in 19th century America. His family came west to Northern Illinois from New York state in the 1830s. They bought farmland built a mill and settled at New Lenox 40 miles southwest of central Chicago where he was born in 1838. Higinbotham became one of the “merchant prince” leaders of the gilded age in Chicago and was a major philanthropist having made his fortune as a partner in Marshall Fields’ dry goods empire. During the Chicago fire of 1871 he was credited as having used his quick wit and leadership instincts to save the firm millions by quickly moving the finest silks and other of the most valuable inventory and irreplaceable financial records from the path of the inferno to his carriage house in New Lenox. Higinbotham married Rachel Davison in 1865 when he returned from serving as an officer in The Civil War. According to scholar and literary critic Harriet Monroe’s 1920 memoir of Harlow Niles Higinbotham an interesting fact is that Higinbotham was with Lincoln in the White House on March 8th 1864 when the president who Higinbotham knew well promoted Grant to the rank of commanding general of the Union Armies.

During the planning of the Fair Higinbotham served as a trustee and in 1892 he was made president of the Exposition. He was president of the Field Columbian Museum from 1898 until 1908.

When Museum benefactor Marshall Field died in 1906 it was revealed that his will included $8000000 in funding for a new building to replace the original (and at that point crumbling) location in Jackson Park. At the time Harlow Niles Higinbotham was serving as president of The Field Museum; having closely worked together on the Fair Higinbotham immediately hired Daniel Burnham to work with him to design the new structure. By January 1907 the first plans (shown above as a blueprint) were presented to the public. The Chicago Tribune wrote that the plan showed promise of “a structure which will be unlike anything ever built in Chicago with the exception of the World’s Fair buildings” [15]. Construction of the stately multimillion square foot marble-clad structure” which cost an exorbitant $6750000 [16] was completed in 1920 and opened in May 1921.

From the opening day of the new building the Tiffany Gems in Higinbotham Hall were a top attraction. One hundred years ago this month on May 2 1921 hundreds of guests flocked to stand in line for their maiden visit. The Chicago Tribune (which at the time was owned and published by Higinbotham’s son in law Joseph Medill Patterson (“The Captain”) and Patterson’s cousin Robert R. McCormick (“The Colonel”)) described the new Museum’s inaugural exhibits with great praise which has continued to the current day.

Continued Higinbotham-Patterson-Crane Collecting and Support Over Three Centuries

Support for The Field Museum by members of the Higinbotham family has now continued over three centuries. Most significantly perhaps was the major donation of a second major collection of Tiffany & Co. gems by Higinbotham’s daughter Florence Higinbotham Crane in 1941. Mrs. Higinbotham Crane was the wife of Richard T. Crane Jr. heir to the Chicago elevator plumbing industrial and aerospace fortune and a long-serving trustee of the museum. The donation included a 97.5-carat imperial ruby topaz which is the largest of its kind in any museum and a stunning 341-carat faceted aquamarine shown in photos below.

Beyond the magnificent gemstones that Mrs. Crane donated to the Field Museum the family’s philanthropy continued with their focus on advancing the museum’s scientific research. There is an entire hall dedicated to larger American mammals which in 1942 was named Richard T. Crane Jr. Hall [18] after Mrs. Crane’s husband. The Cranes’ son Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane funded and donated the use of his yacht “The Illyria” for the Field Museum’s “Crane Pacific Expedition” which took place in 1928-1929 throughout the Pacific Ocean [19]. The expedition prioritized marine research and enabled many Field Museum scientists and specialists to participate. In addition donations were made by Higinbotham’s son Harlow Davison Higinbotham who collected art and artifacts in South America for both the World’s Fair and as donations for the Field Museum.

In the current generations a great-grandson Harlow Niles Higinbotham and his wife Susan have also served on the board of trustees and as well as head of fundraising committees and events; their children are seventh-generation Chicagoans who will support the museum and its scientific mission well into the future.

In writing this article it was imperative to see these gems and gemstones in person and visit and support one of city’s most well-known institutions. A photo simply does not capture the gemstones’ magic radiance and I highly encourage you to do as I did and visit the Tiffany-Higinbotham-Crane exhibit. I personally crave authenticity and cherish craftsmanship in the brands I align with today and these gemstones show the highest level of expertise in the way they were sourced assembled and faceted by Tiffany and displayed to this day by the museum. They remain incomparable to anything you might find in the market today.

As I opened with Louis Vuitton I will close with it. My next article will feature the stories of the Higinbotham-Patterson-Crane family’s and friends’ global travels with their hand-made expertly crafted and beloved Louis Vuitton trunks purchased in Paris as early as the 1880s.

STX,Seagate Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vc2VhZ2F0ZS1leG9zLTJ4MTQtbWFjaC0yLTUwMG1icHMtaGFyZC1kcml2ZS1sYXVuY2hlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seagate Exos 2X14 Mach.2 500MBps Hard Drive Launched,"Seagate has a new drive with a new generation of technology that will bring big gains to the hard drive space. The Seagate Exos 2X14 Mach.2 may sound like the branding for a razor (e.g. the Gillette Mach 3 first released in 1998 that many STH readers use.) Still this new hard drive has a new dual actuator design that effectively doubles the performance of hard drives.

Seagate Exos 2X14 Mach.2

We will get to specs below but the key innovation here is that instead of a traditional single actuator design the Seagate Exos 2X14 Mach.2 14TB drive is effectively two logical 7TB drives each serviced by an independent actuator. This allows the heads to move independently over media.

In these screenshots you can see the two actuators moving independently as they access the rotating media.

This is Seagate’s art on the technology where one can see the two actuators at different angles.

Between using the SAS3 12Gbps interface which offers dual-port access and this new technology Seagate says that it can see in the 1.75-1.9x increase over a single actuator design. Putting this into perspective it also says that a single hard drive can support over 75% more video streams which is an important workload for Seagate’s customers as video storage on hard drives is less expensive than on SSDs.

Overall Seagate says this drive is capable of over 500MB/s of sequential performance which is much higher than traditional single actuator drives. That is important since 10K and 15K RPM drives have become less viable with NAND flash taking over 2.5″ and next-gen form factors aimed at performance. Hard drives need to maintain a $/TB advantage over SSDs yet the performance is limited by slower new recording technologies to get more density and the impracticality of increasing spindle speeds in 3.5″ form factors. Having dual actuators makes getting more performance at the same spindle speed feasible.

Unlike many other drive technologies this is only being launched as a single drive with either 4K or 512b block size variants instead of multiple capacity points.

Seagate Exos 2X14 Mach.2 Key Specs

Here are the key specs from Seagate on the drive:

Something we wanted to point out again is the “Capacity per Logical Unit” line which is 7TB. This drive has two 7TB logical units for 14TB total. This follows the dual actuator design but is a big shift for hard drives.

These are meant to be data center drives rather than consumer/ NAS drives. We did not see pricing but we expect Seagate is getting a premium on these drives.

Final Words

Modern PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSDs can hit 7000MB/s. PCIe Gen5 SSDs will be hitting the market in 2022 at around 14000MB/s so the hard drive folks know that the golden era of SATA III/ SAS2 SSDs is over and performance workloads are on SSD going forward. Still with data being stored on hard drives and a lot of data being stored on hard drives some portion of the market will want more performance from each device which is why going from the 250-300MB/s to 500MB/s range is important.

Hopefully this technology becomes widely adopted and integrated into more drives as volumes ramp. That will help the lower-cost storage increase performance at a much faster rate than we have seen over the past decade.

While SSDs have become the standard for workstations and laptops used for business HDDs are mostly used in data centers since they are capable of storing large amounts of data for cheap. Seagate's latest however takes things a little further. The Mach.2 comes with multi-actuator tech that aims to speed up the rate at which data is transferred without sacrificing storage capacity.

Traditional HDDs have one actuator with both read and write heads. Seagate's Mach.2 has two actuators to double both their sequential and random read/write speeds. The company has been working with Microsoft since the end of 2017 to develop its multi-actuator tech and it looks like the collaboration has paid off. The Mach.2 has a sustained transfer rate of 524MB/s which is faster than the Exos 15E900 making this HDD the fastest in the world right now.

The Seagate Mach.2 Exos 2X14 comes with a 14TB capacity. The drive is basically two 7TB HDDs fused together in a “hermetically sealed helium-filled 3.5-inch chassis”. The HDD features a spindle speed of 7200 RPM a 256MB multisegmented case and a single-port SAS 12GB/s interface. When plugged into a data center server the host system will view the Mach.2 as two logical drives that can be addressed independently. As TechRadar points out the sequential read/write speeds of Seagate‘s new HDD are so fast that it can “even rival some inexpensive SATA/SAS SSDs at a far lower cost-per-TB”.

However the Mach.2's speed comes at a cost of higher power consumption. The Exos 2X14 drive consumes 7.2w in idle mode and up to 13.5 under heavy load. This amount of power is higher than the standard 12W that's usually recommended for 3.5-inch HDDs. But data centers can leverage Seagate's PowerBalance capability to reduce this power consumption though it might lower sequential read/write speeds by about 50% and random read/write speeds by about five to 10%.

The Seagate Mach.2 is listed on the site but it is not going to come to the open market any time soon and for now it is available to select customers.",,,,,,,,,

Parking Garage

K&D Group CEO Doug Price told News 5 soon after his company bought the building that the garage is getting a major facelift to be ready to take on additional parking once Sherwin-William’s new headquarters project removes a large portion of three major surface parking lots next door.

“All new lighting elevators are being redone it’ll be repaired on the outside so you won’t see that ugly cement block splotch thing all over the place” said Price.

Berardi+Cleveland Renderings show what 55 Public Square and its new restaurant could look like from West 3rd Street.

The garage could also eventually house a large video board that would be visible around Public Square and from his restaurant’s rooftop deck.

New Restaurant Space

Price says the roughly 10000 square feet of restaurant space well-known as the former John Q’s Steakhouse will be activated again.

The space could help bridge the gap between the east and west sides of Downtown Cleveland and will be right across the street from the thousands of Sherwin-Williams employees who could one day work across the street.

Berardi+Cleveland New renderings show what 55 Public Square could look like once K&D's $80 million renovation project is finished.

A rooftop just one story off the ground is still likely to have a good view of Public Square and the surrounding streets because Price says he expects the segment of Sherwin-Williams’s headquarters that will be on the parking lot immediately off Public Square will not be too tall.

“This building in front of us will only be two stories” said Price pointing out of the windows in 55 Public Square’s lobby. “According to what I’ve seen so 55 keeps its real high profile in the square.”

55 Public Square

The remaining office tenants are relocating to higher floors where new office space will be built freeing up lower floors for 156 new apartment units.

Of the 156 apartments around 100 of which will be 525 square feet intended for younger residents looking to live downtown as the rental price per square foot continues to increase.

Kevin Barry Three parking lots on the top-right of the picture are slated to be turned into Sherwin-Williams' new headquarters. 55 Public Square is the reflective building they surround.

“Everywhere we have those style units they’re in extremely high demand because of the coast” said Price. “We’ll be at $1000 to $1100 on those units.”

Rent for a two-bedroom apartment in other buildings just a few blocks away on Euclid Avenue can be as high as $2400 per month.

However fewer know that on the other side of the table savvy sellers have an equally important mantra: ""Lighten lighten lighten.""

""We've long known that if you want to appeal to the greatest number of buyers use light colors"" said Annie Elliot project manager for New Again Houses a fix-and-flip company based in Tennessee with franchises in 11 states. In that role Elliot has managed nearly 300 house flipping projects.

""In 95% of the homes I tackle darkness is a big problem"" Elliot said when we talked recently about the power of light. ""Dark interiors feel depressing and make spaces feel smaller"" she said.

""Lighter more open spaces feel happier"" she said. ""They also look cleaner bigger and more inviting.""

Knotty problem — “This was a really dark home” said Annie Elliot project manager for New Again Houses. “The nicotine-stained knotty-pine walls made you felt like you were living inside a woodchipper.” (Courtesy of Jessany Willis)

To bust through the darkness so her projects will appeal to the widest range of buyers Elliot applies a variety of fixer tricks to brighten and lighten interior spaces.

For instance she always chooses a light neutral palette often painting interior walls pale gray and kitchens and baths calming shades of blues and greens. She also often paints over wood paneling — gasp! — and old brick moves not everyone agrees with.

""Painting over wood raises a lot of eyebrows"" she said. When she asks her Instagram followers to weigh in on whether to paint over wood walls in a house she's fixing up or leave them the results are usually 50-50.

Although some believe painting over any finished wood is sacrilege I agree with Elliot that with some important exceptions painting wood can be a smart move. For instance when my husband and I bought our Happier Yellow House it had a brown wood front door which one designer I talked to really loved but I didn't. We painted it Sherwin Williams Jalapeno (a dark orange) and I have not regretted it.

Bathroom refresh — Nothing about this bathroom’s dark blue walls curtain-covered windows and dated brown vanity invite you in. (Courtesy of Jessany Willis)

""If people only see the after and don't know what is underneath they love it"" she said. ""It's making that initial decision to paint over wood that's hard.""

Exceptions include hardwood floors log homes fine furniture and historic wood walls and ceilings in good condition. Elliot also hesitates to paint wood kitchen cabinets because the paint finish often doesn't hold up to the use. Since replacing cabinets is expensive ""if the kitchen layout is good and the wood cabinets in good condition we find it's often better to leave the cabinets and lighten up other surfaces"" Elliot said. She may put in a white subway-tile backsplash lighter counters and more light fixtures.

That's not to say we should all seek white on light interiors. Strong colors definitely have a place and used tastefully can be amazing. ""I love a dark wall color in the right room"" Elliot said ""particularly in rooms that have high ceilings and a lot of natural light.""

To simplify this here's how I think of interior color: When designing or fixing up our homes we all pretty much want the same thing to inspire oohs and ahhs from those who enter including ourselves. When you walk into a room filled with saturated color you say ""ooh."" When you walk into one filled with the light neutrals you say ""ahh."" When selling a house you want more ahhs than oohs but you still want both.

Bathroom refresh — A new white vanity and sink white beadboard panels ceramic floor tiles updated faucets fixtures and hardware and walls repainted Sherwin Williams Dutch Tile Blue all uplift the space and eliminate that cave-like feeling. (Courtesy of Jessany Willis)

And that is as scientific as I am going to get about that.

Even if you're not planning to put your house on the market looking at your house through the eyes of a professional flipper can steer you toward making improvements that will make your home more enjoyable now and closer to sale ready when that day comes.

So whether you're fixing to sell or dwell here are a dozen ways Elliot and I came up with to lighten and brighten your home:

◼️ Outside remove or cut back bushes or trees blocking natural light from coming in.

◼️ Add a skylight or windows or enlarge existing ones. While you're at it clean the glass and refresh screens.

◼️ Remove heavy window treatments. Cover windows with white or off-white sheers use light-colored blinds or shutters for light control and privacy. If you do hang drapes have them frame rather than cover windows.

◼️ Add white wainscoting or moldings.

◼️ Install white or light tiles on floors in bathrooms and laundry rooms and on kitchen backsplashes.

◼️ Paint walls in light soft neutrals.

◼️ Hang decorative mirrors which reflect and amplify light.

◼️ Install more light fixtures put in brighter bulbs and put outlets on a dimmer.

◼️ Keep large furnishings light; add color with rugs pillows and art.

◼️ Replace dark cabinets with light ones where economical.

◼️ Cover wood floors with lighter-colored area rugs.

◼️ Declutter. Clean surfaces whatever their color make you say ""ahhs.""

The largest shopping mall operator in the United States which owns 13 locations in Massachusetts is adjusting its face mask rules.

Simon Property Group which has shopping centers malls and retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico said Friday in locations where there is no state or local jurisdictional mask mandate visitors who are fully vaccinated may enter without a face mask or face shield.

""If you are not fully vaccinated please wear a mask"" Simon said.

Massachusetts will drop its face mask mandate for fully-vaccinated people on May 29 which will bring the state in line with current guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Non-vaccinated individuals in Massachusetts will be advised to continue wearing face masks and to continue distancing in most settings which is also in line with the CDC's guidance.

""I think people are misinterpreting thinking that this is a removal of a mask mandate for everyone. It's not"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

""In terms of the honor system people have to be honest with themselves. You're protected if you're vaccinated you're not if you're not vaccinated"" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky

Simon Property Group currently owns the following shopping centers malls and retail properties in Massachusetts:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy90aGUtcGl6emVyaWEtaXNsaXAtYTE0MTQy0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2RheS5jb20vYW1wL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy90aGUtcGl6emVyaWEtaXNsaXAtYTE0MTQy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Pizzeria opens 3rd Long Island location in Islip,"When Cliff Weinstein and Paul Saccoccio met at a soccer tournament when they were around seven years old there was no way they could imagine that one day they'd conspire on pizza topped with Thai chili sauce or a thick airy pie with three kinds of cheese baked into the crust.

Thirty years later though that's just where the two longtime buddies have found themselves as they unveil the third location in Islip of The Pizzeria their rapidly expanding string of eateries. Clad in subway tile and wooden accents with gas ovens and front cases full of vividly colored pie The Pizzeria also counts locations in the Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove and in Bayport; and if all goes to plan by the end of the summer they'll open another in Bay Shore.

""I always thought we would do something together"" said Saccoccio 38 who has long run Gino's Pizzeria of Ronkonkoma alongside his father Gino (who founded the shop in 1976) uncle Dominick and brother Marco. When he was approached by the shopping mall operator Simon Property Group which was looking for a mom-and-pop eatery ""I thought 'it's time'"" he said.

Serendipitously Weinstein 39 had recently sold a technology business and was looking for the next project. Together with Saccoccio's brother Dan Saccoccio they signed a lease for a spot in the Smith Haven Mall food court and built the look feel and recipes for The Pizzeria a sort of pizza 3.0 concept that combines staples such as cheese slices and garlic knots (albeit petite ones) with gas-fired specialty pies like Detroit-style and vodka margherita pizza.

Like everyone else they were blissfully unaware of what was to come in the form of COVID-19. When The Pizzeria finally opened in the mall in July the food court seating was closed ""and malls were in triage mode"" said Saccoccio.

""As the year went on the foot traffic came back and people appreciated that we brought authentic pizza back into the mall"" added Weinstein.

Late in 2020 the partners had the opportunity to take over Tony's Pizzeria in Bayport and opened a second Pizzeria in December. It was there that the Bakeri pie was born a sort of hacked Detroit-style pie that uses a round baking dish instead of the traditional rectangular pan and whose dough takes more than a day to proof. Three kinds of cheese are baked into the crust one version of which also sports vodka sauce pepperoni and basil and rises to a cloudlike level of fluffiness. ""It's not practical it's not efficient but …"" Saccoccio said as Weinstein whipped out a phone video of the moment Saccoccio realized they had perfected the pie. As he bites into a slice Saccoccio's eyes widen and he makes rapid-fire gestures of glee.

The $24.95 pie is not on the official menu at either Islip or Bayport but there are a few for sale each day to those who know to ask for it. There are myriad other pies to choose from as well: regular pies ($19.95) such as cheese and pepperoni — a cheese slice is $2.95 — and $24.95 specialty pies such as The Honey Pep with pepperoni and a hot-honey drizzle; a pie improbably topped with Thai chili sauce and another with meatballs and burrata.

Heroes like one with prosciutto mozzarella tomatoes and basil on focaccia start at $9.95 and there are. pastas (baked ziti penne with broccoli et al) and entrees such as chicken Francese and eggplant Parm plus calzone Buffalo-style garlic knots and other snacks. ""We wanted a simple and confident menu"" said Saccoccio adding that Kenny Keane a CIA-trained chef who works in Bayport helped hone the menu. So far Weinstein and Saccoccio have hired 25 to 30 people between the three locations and Weinstein credited the group's partner-contractor DJT Development of Holtsville as enabling them to do quick turnarounds on the spaces they take over. (The Islip location takes over the Main St. space where Pizza Parm used to be).

Beer and wine are on tap in Bayport and Islip and a full bar is under construction in Bay Shore which will also have outdoor seating. ""We'd like to do our version of Negroni"" Weinstein said but the rest of the cocktails are still in development.

Though Saccoccio has grown his pizza purview beyond Gino's and branched into new recipes The Pizzeria still uses the dough that his father taught him to make — and Saccoccio said his dad has developed a ritual for each new iteration of The Pizzeria. ""My father comes in to each location the day before we open helps me prep and helps me make the first pie"" Saccoccio said. ""We make the pie together. It's his way of saying 'good luck.'""

Lauren Barry was nervous people would forget about her.

The owner of The Elder Bread known for its breads and doughnuts had closed operations at LangLab earlier this year along with Violet Sky Chocolates owner Hans Westerink and Mandy Krause of pastry business Love and Macarons. The group of entrepreneurs said they hit an impasse with the High Street building owners and decided it was time to go in their own direction creating a brief lapse of when customers could regularly access their goods.

But people didn’t forget with many regulars asking of plans and updates on where and when to get their favorite bread chocolate and macarons.

“It’s pretty neat to see (customers) around town and they are like ‘holy cow how are you doing?’” said Barry. “You don’t realize like the relationships and what you mean to people and your impact on people. It’s a good feeling.”

Now the group has opened The Cloud Walking Collective at 1215 E. Mishawaka Ave. near the South Bend Farmer’s Market. Structured similarly to the business model at The Dainty Maid building the new collective allows for each business to still run as its own while also allowing collaboration with one another. In addition to the three businesses Westerink will also open coffee business Cloud Walking Coffee with Meg Stevens running operations creating a structure of four-core businesses that will also welcome other entrepreneurs artists and musicians to share the space.

“It’s basically just like a collaborative space as the foundation of it” Westerink said. “We’re the four core businesses but we want to bring in other people our friends that are artisans or chefs or musicians and have them participate in the space.”

The idea stemmed from working together inside the collaborative space at LangLab with Westerink describing it as a “breath of fresh air for South Bend.” It also encourages local creatives to interact with one another in a collaborative effort without having to worry about a large overhead cost.

“It’s a collective where you’re not tied down so it wouldn’t stop you from doing your own thing if you wanted to but then you also have a home” Wersterink said.

“I can’t do it on my own at least as a whole establishment” Barry said. “The four core businesses together make sense like chocolate pastries bread and it brings a lot to the table.”

For months the group has transformed the former Merriman’s space into a kitchen and cafe space that is now open for popup events on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Natural light floods into the space thanks to large overhead skylights.

Customers will be able to purchase coffee bread macarons pastries and chocolate all in one space and under one purchase with owners streamlining payment operations. However for the time being customers must walk to the back of the building as the front still remains under construction. Westerink hopes construction will be complete by the end of summer and then they will be able to expand their days and hours of operation with plans to offer more food options such as pizza and tacos and other events as well.

“We definitely want it to be more than a place where it’s just a cafe” Barry said.

Cloud Walking Collective is open Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Keep up to date with weekly offerings from each business on their social media pages.

Heaven and Earth Floral Shop items auctioned off

Longtime flower business Heaven and Earth in South Bend remains closed with many of its items listed at a liquidation auction last week.

In June 2019 owner Dani Graf took out a loan to purchase the business from longtime owner Cathy Catanzarite before the coronavirus would cause thousands of businesses to shutter across the country less than a year later.

According to court documents filed in December 2020 Graf defaulted on the loan and as of last October owed more than $127000.

During an interview in February Graf said she intended to get through the proceedings and reopen the business but noted a lot still depends on legal proceedings.

“I’m going to do everything I possibly can to make sure this business keeps going” she said. “And I need to get back to work. This has all been such a mess.”

However in April court documents show Graf failed to appear and a judge ruled in favor of creditor Centier Bank ordering the flower business owner to pay the outstanding restitution. Items like the flower shop’s van coolers and furniture were then advertised on Kraft Auction Service’s social media page for a liquidation sale where bidding closed May 18 and pickup was scheduled for the next day.

Property records show Catanzarite still owns the property at 143 S. Dixie Way in Roseland.

Graf did not immediately respond to The Tribune’s request for comment in light of the recent judgement.

Low or non-existent consumer demand reduced spending and stay-at-home orders crushed many businesses.

Even after the economy slowly started to reopen social distancing norms kept most consumers away from the markets. This resulted in many companies going bankrupt including some big names.

Here are 10 big companies that went bankrupt due to the COVID-19 pandemic last year.

Ten companies that went bankrupt due to COVID-19

Last year companies from almost all industries including clothing retailers travel companies oil producers and more filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. For our list of 10 big companies that went bankrupt due to the COVID-19 pandemic we have only considered popular household names.

A point to note is that filing for bankruptcy doesn’t inherently mean that the company will shut down.

Rather it is more of a financial restructuring. Here are 10 big companies that went bankrupt due to the COVID-19 pandemic last year (the list is in no particular order):

1. NPC International Inc.

This company may not be a household name but it does have a household connection. NPC International is the largest franchisee of Pizza Hut restaurants. It opened the first Pizza Hut in 1962. NPC operates over 1200 Pizza Hut and more than 385 Wendy’s stores across the U.S. It is the second-biggest franchise operator in the U.S. NPC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July.

2. Hertz

Hertz struggled after the drop in travel due to the pandemic last year. The company’s used car sales also witnessed a significant drop.

This forced the car rental company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 22. Hertz had about $20 billion in debt last year. The company is working on selling most of its fleet to pay its creditors.

3. CMX Cinemas

CMX Cinemas filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 25 2020. This chain of movie theaters with dine-in options is owned by Cinemex Holdings.

The company won the court’s approval to sell the chain to an affiliate and pay up to 15% of unsecured claims. CMX Cinemas entered the U.S. market in April 2017 and soon was in the top-10 circuit in the North American market.

4. Rubie’s Costume Company

This company that makes costumes wigs and other festive gear filed for bankruptcy on April 30 2020. Rubie’s claims to be the biggest designer and maker of Halloween costumes in the world.

This company got new ownership after its Chapter 11 bankruptcy and became Rubies II LLC. Prior to this it was a family-owned and operated business that has been in existence for about seven decades.

5. Brooks Brothers

Founded in 1818 this classic suit brand filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 8. In August a joint venture of Simon Property Group and Authentic Brands Group won court approval to acquire Brooks Brothers for $325 million.

The new owners of this centuries-old brand promised to keep at least 125 Brooks Brothers stores running. Even before the pandemic Brooks Brothers was considering a potential sale.

6. J. Crew

This preppy retailer filed for bankruptcy on May 4. J. Crew has already been struggling over the last few years due to the decline in mall traffic and the rise of online retailers.

The pandemic made it even tougher for the retailer to meet its debt commitments. After the bankruptcy filing all J. Crew lenders agreed to convert about $1.7 billion of the company’s debt into equity.

7. J.C. Penney

Founded in 1902 this retailer filed for bankruptcy in May 2020. The pandemic was not the only reason the retailer filed for bankruptcy. J.C. Penney was already struggling due to competition from Amazon and Walmart.

Following bankruptcy the company reached a deal to sell most of its retail and operating assets to Brookfield Asset Management and Simon Property Group.

8. Gold’s Gym

This company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 4 2020. Gold’s Gym owns and operates over 700 gyms in the U.S. and internationally.

Gold’s Gym International was auctioned off in a court-approved auction process to Berlin-based RSG Group for $100 million. RSG Group owns the ultra-popular McFIT brand in Europe.

9. Chesapeake Energy

The massive reduction in energy demand following the pandemic last year forced this Oklahoma City-based company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2020. The company had more than $9 billion in debt and $1 billion in maturities and interest.

Chesapeake emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year after removing $7.7 billion in debt from its balance sheet. The company will now focus more on natural gas than shale.

10. Virgin Atlantic

Virgin Atlantic filed for Chapter 15 protection on August 4 in New York. The company is 49% owned by Delta.

Prior to filing bankruptcy Richard Branson‘s company tried to negotiate a bailout deal with the British government and a private rescue package but things didn’t work out.

Coronation Street star Samia Longchambon had fans doing a double-take as she shared a snap with her ‘twin’ niece.

The actress – who plays Maria Connor in the ITV soap – took to Instagram as she posed alongside niece Sasha Ghadie making light of the vast differences in their Friday night plans.

She blessed us all with a snap as she rocked a grey tracksuit while her niece was ready for a night out opting for a lacy green top and leather trousers.

‘Night in v night out? Night in wins for me every time’ the 38-year-old wrote alongside the upload.

‘Happy to leave the glam nights out to my doll of a niece @sashaghadie #friday #nightin #homebird.’

Sasha – the daughter of Samia’s brother Tariq – shared the picture on her own Instagram story simply captioned with a string of cry laughing emoji.

Fans couldn’t get over how similar the pair looked in the photo flooding the comments section to discuss their similarities.

Samia’s Corrie co-star Georgia Taylor couldn’t get over it commenting: ‘Darling you look like twins!!! Gorgeous xxx.’

‘Wow double take both beautiful’ a fan replied.

‘Haha I thought you were announcing that you’d got a wax model of yourself! You’re almost identical’ another agreed.

‘I thought that was you in different clothes and make up’ an Instagram user laughed.

As one added: ‘Niece? I wondered if you had done some clever photoshopping with two pics of you merged into one!

‘Absolutely stunning. You could be identical twins.’

The unanimous vote by the PUC's commissioners on Thursday accepted the opinion and order of Judge Elizabeth Barnes who ruled in December that the project should be rejected because it serves little purpose and would have “detrimental” economic and environmental effects for nearby landowners.

The $372 million project headed by Transource Energy originally proposed the development of 16 miles of new transmission lines in Pennsylvania and Maryland including in York County. Transource has argued the project was needed to reinforce the electric grid address reliability issues and reduce energy prices in the region.

Barnes in her 153-page opinion argued that Transource Energy failed to show a need for the project within the meaning of commission regulations and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Code.

“Further the project will have detrimental economic and environmental impacts"" Barnes an administrative law judge for the state PUC added.

On Thursday PUC commissioners did not comment on the project or mention Transource in the vote — which included several other agenda items in a single motion.

Dolores Krick president of Citizens to Stop Transource said the organization is thrilled that the PUC followed the ruling of Judge Barnes.

""We fought hard to defeat Transource"" Krick said via email. ""We fought for the farmers and private landowners — and for the Pennsylvania utility customers that ultimately pay for these projects.""

Nils Hagen-Frederiksen a spokesperson for the PUC said on Sunday that staff members are in the process of serving copies of the Transource orders on several hundred parties who are directly involved in the case.

""After all of the direct parties in the case have been notified the orders will be formally entered on the public dockets"" Hagen-Frederiksen said via email. ""At this point we expect service to be completed and the orders docketed on Monday.""

Also on Sunday Transource Energy Director Todd Burns said in a statement that because the order hasn't been posted yet the company needs time to review the decision and determine the next steps.

""We are disappointed with the commission’s decision not to pursue this project despite the overwhelming evidence of the benefits"" Burns added.

Transource's project would have included a new transmission line connecting a new substation in Lower Chanceford Township to the existing Conastone substation near Norrisville in Harford County Maryland.

A segment also would have run through Franklin County.

In response to the project opposition groups — including Citizens to Stop Transource — formed. The organization protested the project's development which would have crossed about 40 properties in York County.

In October 2019 Transource filed a new scaled-back route that would no longer have affected those properties instead expanding the size of the Furnace Run substation constructing 4 miles of new line in that vicinity rebuilding portions of existing lines and utilizing some existing structures instead of new infrastructure.

Krick said her group was glad to see the PUC reject the project.

""We proved that the power line that Transource wanted to build had no benefit to Pennsylvania residents and we believed this project should be denied"" Krick said.

And most are within a short drive of the major metropolitan areas in the state.

Here are the top 10 most famous Utah ghost towns and how to find them (with a few honorable mentions for good measure).

1. Grafton one of the most famous ghost towns in Utah

Located just outside of Zion National Park you probably know Grafton already even if you don’t realize it. It tops our list of 10 famous Utah ghost towns because it got some major screen time in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.” Some claim Grafton is the most photographed ghost town in the West. We can’t prove that but it appeared in at least one other movie 1929’s “In Old Arizona” one of the first “talkies.”

Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints first settled in the area in 1859 on a mission from Brigham Young to grow cotton in southern Utah. They established a growing community on the banks of the Virgin River known as Wheeler. But flooding washed away most of the town in 1862 so they moved about a mile upriver to a place they named New Grafton. Over time they dropped the word ‘new’ from the name.

Flooding continued to plague Grafton’s residents. Rising waters not only threatened its structures but also filled irrigation canals with silt. Residents had to dredge the canals weekly. The outbreak of the Black Hawk War meant the town had to evacuate in 1866 but continued flooding prompted residents to resettle elsewhere. Most historians consider the town’s official demise to have come in 1921 when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints pulled out its local presence. But technically three people still live in Grafton.

Roots run deep though and some of the orchards those early settlers planted still exist today. You can wander through the main street (really just a dirt path) and even into some of the buildings. Pay your respects to early residents at the town cemetery a short distance away.

Getting there

Take Interstate 15 to exit 27 for Utah S.R. 17 toward Toquerville and Hurricane. Stay on S.R. 17 for about 6 miles until you reach the town of La Verkin. There turn left on 500 North/S.R. 9 East. Drive 15 miles on S.R. 9 East to the town of Rockville. Turn right on Bridge Road. Drive 0.3 miles crossing over the Virgin River then turn right on 250 South/Grafton Road. Continue roughly 3 miles. The road changes from paved to gravel to dirt then ends at the ghost town.

2. Silver Reef former mining boomtown

Like many ghost towns of the Old West Silver Reef got its start as a mining settlement. A man named John Kemple discovered silver there in 1866. He returned in 1874 hoping to find the source of the vein of silver staking several more claims but without locating the source.

Then in 1875 word got out about Kemple’s discovery. A pair of Salt Lake bankers known as the Walker brothers hired a prospector to check it out on their behalf. The prospector William T. Barbee staked nearly two dozen claims and established a town he called “Bonanza City.” But miners drawn to the area by reports of silver preferred to set up camp outside of town which they called “Rockpile.”

That same year after the mines closed in Pioche Nev. some of its miners relocated to Rockpile renaming it “Silver Reef.” At its peak the town hosted 2500 residents nine grocery stores six saloons and even a newspaper which made it the largest town in southern Utah at the time.

But it wouldn’t last. A downturn in the silver market dealt one major blow and decreasing wages for miners dealt another. While the mines generated millions of dollars of silver ore the last mine closed up in 1891.

Today much of the town has been overtaken by new development making it therefore off-limits to explorers but you can still visit the old Wells Fargo Express Office which was turned into a museum and the bank now a gift shop. Feel like stretching your legs? A short trail will take you to one of the kilns once used to process silver.

Getting there

From the north take southbound I-15 to exit 23 for Leeds/Silver Reef. Turn right at the “T” on Silver Reef Road driving west about 1.5 miles. Turn left at the “Y” in the road which becomes Silver Reef Drive. The museum is on the right at the corner of Silver Reef Drive and Wells Fargo Drive.

From the south drive northbound on I-15 to exit 22 for Leeds/Silver Reef. Turn north on Main Street through Leeds about 1.3 miles. Next turn left on Silver Reef Road passing under the freeway toward the red cliffs for about 1.5 miles. Turn left at the “Y” in the road which becomes Silver Reef Drive. The museum is on the right at the corner of Silver Reef Drive and Wells Fargo Drive.

3. Old Irontown one of the first Utah ghost towns

Just about 20 miles outside of Cedar City lies Old Irontown one of the Utah ghost towns with the most structures left behind to explore.

Founded in 1868 Old Irontown was originally known as Iron City. In a way it came about because of the establishment of Cedar City more than a decade before. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints settled Cedar City in the 1850s with the express goal of establishing an iron works. The mining operation there eventually failed and closed down though settlers remained. However that led to Peter Shirts’ discovery of the Iron City site in 1868 and the subsequent organization of the Union Iron Company by Ebenezer Hanks that same year.

Iron City grew quickly filling with 97 residents within two years. The town boasted not just the foundry furnaces and blacksmith you would expect but even a schoolhouse. However by 1876 it was abandoned. A money panic in 1874 proved too difficult to overcome.

Today you can still check out ruins of Old Irontown that tell the story of iron mining and processing. The most recognizable structure is an old beehive-shaped charcoal oven but you can also find the brick chimney that once served as part of the foundry and an “Arastra” a type of mill used to grind the iron ore so it could be used to charge the furnace.

Be polite if you visit — there are nearby residents who call the area home.

Getting there

Take I-15 to Cedar City exiting at Utah State Route 56 also known as 200 North. Head west on UT-56 continuing 19.5 miles then turn left on Old Iron Town Road which is gravel. Follow roughly 3 miles to the historic site.

For extra credit stop by the Frontier Homestead State Park Museum in Cedar City on your way to see artifacts from the site and learn more about the area’s early settlers.

4. Welcome to Stateline born in a Utah gold rush

Someone discovered gold around 1894 in them thar hills — or at least in Stateline Canyon near the Nevada state line in Iron County Utah.

The discovery of gold and silver in the area prompted a bit of a rush followed by the establishment of the Ophir mine in Stateline Canyon in 1896. Two more mines the Johnny and the Creole soon followed.

At one point 300 people called Stateline home. It included everything you would expect of an Old West town: saloons a couple of general stores a daily stagecoach to the nearest town with a railroad stop and even its own newspaper.

But before long the mines had given up all they could; the town slowly faded away; its last residents gone by the end of 1918.

Sadly much of what remained of Stateline burned with widespread wildfires in 2020. However the cemetery is well-kept and worth paying your respects.

Need more adventure? Stateline Canyon and the surrounding area feature plenty of trails for ATVs and dirt bikes. You’ll also pass through Modena to get to Stateline — and with its fewer than 20 residents it practically qualifies as a ghost town too.

Getting there

Take I-15 to Cedar City exiting at Utah State Route 56 also known as 200 North. Much like the road to Old Irontown your next move is to head west on UT-56 but this time you’re going to drive 51.6 miles to the town of Modena. Turn right on Modena Canyon/Hamblin Valley Road. Continue 12.9 miles then turn left at Hall’s Road. After 1.1 miles the road curves to the right and becomes 13600 West. Continue another 0.1 miles then make the first left you can make followed by the next right. Continue roughly 2 miles – the road ends at the Stateline cemetery.

5. Sego Utah – a coal ghost town

If you’re already planning a trip to the red rock country around Moab Utah you might as well check out one of the easiest to reach ghost towns on this list: Sego. In fact if you’ve ever needed to make a pit stop at the Thompson Springs rest area between Moab and the Colorado state line you were almost within reach of Sego without knowing it.

Sego got its start as a coal town. Henry Ballard one of Thompson Springs’ founding fathers found a seam of coal near Sego in 1908 and established a camp calling it — what else? Ballard.

Ballard eventually sold his camp to B. F. Bauer and his American Fuel Company which resulted in fast expansion a spur railroad line and the renaming of the town to Neslen after the mine’s new general manager Richard Neslen. A company store a boarding house and a post office soon followed.

But it’s hard to keep a town functioning and growing without water and soon after its founding Neslen’s creeks and springs started to dry up. In perhaps an ironic twist too much water in the form of flash floods proved problematic for the trains — washing out bridges and trestles needed for the railroad spur to reach the coal mine. The coal company struggled to make a profit miners went on strike when they weren’t paid for months at a time and the company went through a restructuring in 1916. That move which also replaced the mine’s general manager eventually resulted in a name change for the town in 1918 to Sego for the Utah state flower the sego lily.

But the financial struggles didn’t go away with the restructuring. Corporate coal moved out of the area in 1947 and while the remaining miners bought what was left and established a company of their own it didn’t last. Flash floods wiped out the last vestiges of town life in the 1950s and forced any remaining miners to leave.

Not much remains because a number of the buildings were moved to Thompson after the town petered out. But you can still see dugouts and foundations of a number of structures plus the old Sego hotel’s red rock walls still stand.

Getting there

Take I-70 to exit 187 toward Thompson Springs. Turn left on UT-94 North crossing under the interstate and driving 1.4 miles until the road merges with Sego Canyon Road and curves to the right. Drive 3.4 miles on this road passing through the town until you see Bureau of Land Management signs for the Sego Canyon Rock Art Interpretive Site. Turn right then right again to stay with Sego Canyon Road. If you want park at the BLM site to explore petroglyphs before continuing past to find the ghost town another 1.7 miles down the road.

Note: The road turns to gravel in places and dirt in others and crosses through a dry wash at several points. Check the forecast before you go and do NOT attempt when meteorologists predict rain as the road becomes impassible.

6. Thistle a rare non-mining example among Utah ghost towns

One of the few Utah ghost towns on the list not to have ties to gold silver iron or coal mining Thistle stands out from the rest. Its origins stem not from early Latter-day Saints settlements but from the arrival of the railroad.

Designed to accommodate the trains chugging through Spanish Fork Canyon in the late 1800s Thistle became an important stop between Denver and the Salt Lake Valley. The Denver & Rio Grande Western railroad rebuilt an existing narrow-gauge track there to standard-gauge then connected it with its line from Denver providing a connection to Salt Lake City to the north. As a result the railroad added facilities at Thistle to service trains and prepare them for the grades and curves ahead for example by adding an extra engine before a steep climb. Before the era of dining cars on trains Thistle also served as a meal stop.

Thistle’s decline began long before natural disaster took its toll. When railroads switched from steam to diesel locomotives the town’s maintenance services became less and less important over time. Between the 1950s and the 1970s the population shrank. Crews tore down the passenger depot in 1972 and the post office two years later.

Heavier than normal rain and snow in the autumn and winter of 1982 followed by more moisture and a faster than expected snowmelt in spring 1983 created a perfect storm for Thistle.

On April 13 1983 railroad maintenance crews started to notice the track had shifted. A highway patrol trooper hit a buckle on US 6 the road through the canyon that pitched him up against his car’s roof. Crews immediately went to work to try to keep the highway and the rail line open but to no avail. On April 14 they closed the road and the tracks to all traffic. Another two days later the landslide had completely buried the tracks. Another day after that the evacuation order became mandatory as the landslide’s impact damming the nearby river would undoubtedly flood the town.

Residents evacuated to the town of Birdseye 5 miles away with whatever they could grab on short notice. By the next day the water reached the rooftops of their former homes. The day after that 50 feet of soil covered the former route of US-6. By the time it was done the landslide created a lake held in by an earthen dam.

You can still see partially flooded homes and other structures left behind by the Thistle landslide and flood.

Getting there

From I-15 drive east on US 6 from Spanish Fork. Drive roughly 11 miles away from I-15 then turn right on Spanish Fork River Park Road to view the landslide from the “downstream” side. If you prefer get back on US 6 and continue another 1.7 miles. Turn right into the large pullout just before the massive double road cut. You’ll find a sign with an overview of the disaster and a viewpoint. Travel another 1.5 miles past the pullout and turn right on US 89 then follow another 1.5 miles to find the remains of Thistle.

7. Castle Gate site of a coal mining disaster

Once a thriving mining town and like Thistle an important stop on the Denver & Rio Grande Western railroad’s line from Denver to Salt Lake City not much remains of Castle Gate. But we included it on our list of ghost towns because if you drive US 6 from Spanish Fork toward Price (or vice versa) you can’t miss it. And it’s the site of two major historical events in Utah.

Castle Gate gained a measure of notoriety during its heyday as the site of one of Butch Cassidy’s most daring heists.

The town wouldn’t get its name for a number of years but activity in the area started to ramp up in 1886 as the Pleasant Valley Coal Company set up shop and began mining. PVCC set up a company town naming it after the unique rock formations near the mine.

On April 21 1897 a train from Salt Lake City rolled into Castle Gate with PVCC’s payroll — around $8800 in three bags. Two cowboys approached the company paymaster and the two guards with him intercepting their plan to carry the money the 75 or so yards from the train to the PVCC office. Later identified as Butch Cassidy and Elza Lay the two cowboys made off with around $7000 of the cash. No one ever recovered the money.

March 8 1924 goes down in infamy in Castle Gate history. On that date a series of explosions destroyed the Utah Fuel Company’s Castle Gate Mine #2. And 172 miners perished many of them immigrants. To this day it remains the tenth deadliest mine disaster in United States history. One of the three explosions resulted in the mine’s collapse. But historians believe lighting a gas lamp near improperly dampened coal dust caused the first blast.

The only visible remains of Castle Gate itself are the rock formations that gave it its name and a power plant no longer in operation that sits at the base of the canyon. However travelers can learn more about the mine disaster through interpretive signs at a pullout near the rock formations. The town cemetery is well-preserved and easily accessed.

Getting there

From Spanish Fork take US 6 east through Spanish Fork Canyon. The pull-off to view the Castle Gate rock formation and learn more about the mine disaster will be on your left after about 55 miles. To reach the cemetery proceed south past the pull-out and make the next possible left turn on US 191. The cemetery sits just a short distance to the east on your left.

8. Frisco one of the more notorious ghost towns in Utah

The town of Frisco got its start as a post office for the San Francisco Mining Company after the discovery of silver in the area in 1875. Miners established the post office just two years later and within two years the site boasted two smelters. In 1880 the completion of a rail spur to Milford 15 miles away fueled Frisco’s population boom to more than 6000 residents.

The population boom and the attraction of precious metals also brought some less than savory elements. Frisco earned a reputation as a wild rough and violent town. Several accounts tell of the town’s 23 saloons and at one point an average of one murder per day.

Frisco became more respectable with the arrival of a sheriff. He made quick work of putting a stop to the lawlessness. But its demise came from the collapse of the silver mine in 1885. The collapse forced the mine to close for a year and when it reopened it produced ore much more slowly than before. Residents slowly drifted away; by the 1920s most had departed.

The most recognizable remnants of Frisco include charcoal kilns listed on the National Register of Historic Places. But visitors will also enjoy exploring the town cemetery and remaining abandoned structures and equipment.

9. Welcome to Promontory home of the Golden Spike

Not much remains of Promontory the town that sprang up practically overnight as crews raced to connect the railroad from East to West on the north end of the Great Salt Lake.

Sometimes confused with Promontory Point the name of a “cape” of land that juts into the Great Salt Lake the city of Promontory grew quickly before the railroad arrived there as the agreed-upon location for the railroads to join. Meetings in Washington D.C. in April 1869 resulted in the choosing of Promontory Summit as that site. Originally the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads planned to lay the final tracks at that location on May 8. But bad weather and a labor dispute resulted in a two-day delay; instead we mark the anniversary of the completion of the intercontinental railroad on May 10 1869.

A crew of Chinese and Irish immigrants laid the final 10 miles of track in just 12 hours.

The tent city that sprang up around the event thrived with some “tents” sporting wooden facades. But it soon earned a reputation as a rough and tumble place. Saloons and card rooms in particular attracted unsavory elements. After con artists took everything from a family of German immigrants Promontory’s workers put up notices warning those who would do harm to others to leave town or face hanging. They did so without further violence by sunset on Sunday Nov. 21 1869.

Promontory City lived just a short time later. By December of 1869 most of the traders and merchants who set up shop had moved on as the railroads changed the transfer point for trains from Promontory to nearby Ogden. A hotel and restaurant remained a little longer but by the next summer just 120 people mostly railroad employees remained at Promontory.

Eventually a more direct route across the Great Salt Lake finished off what remained of Promontory City. Southern Pacific built a wooden trestle that crossed the salty lake bypassing Promontory altogether. During World War II the area marked the “unspiking” of the historic site removing the last rail from Promontory Summit to repurpose the old steel for the war.

You can’t really visit structures leftover from the Promontory City days of Promontory Summit. But the location itself still offers a lot to visitors. Now set aside as Golden Spike National Historic Park a museum on the site offers photos of what the town once looked like plus two replica locomotives that regularly re-enact the events of May 10 1869. If you want to stretch your legs walking trails offer a close look at some of the railway cuts and grades.

Getting there

From Salt Lake City or Ogden head north on I-15 and take exit 365 toward UT-13/Promontory Road. Merge onto UT-13 to head west. Continue 2.7 miles as UT-13 becomes UT-83. Drive 17.4 miles then turn left on 7200 North. Continue another 2 miles then make a slight right on 18400 West. After another 4.6 miles turn left on 22000 West/Golden Spike Road. You will see the historic park on your right after about a mile.

10. Russian Settlement one of the Utah ghost towns with no real name

Last but not least on our list of Utah ghost towns is Russian Settlement which lasted just three years in Box Elder County northwest of the Great Salt Lake.

We don’t know what its residents called Russian Settlement. What we do know is that it was founded much like the state of Utah itself on faith.

The Russian people Spiritual Christians who purchased 4 square miles of Park Valley land in Box Elder County in March 1914 hoped to shield their children from worldly influences and to raise them in their own traditions and culture. In Los Angeles where they had lived for roughly 10 years before that they worried about urban influences on some of their practices such as arranged marriages. Advertisements from Pacific Land and Water promised rich farming land some of the best in Utah.

Arriving in April 1914 at their new town site they put in the work to build a village. Town founders laid out an east-to-west main street with 200 feet of frontage for each lot. They bought farm animals from nearby ranchers planted crops in the dusty soil and built houses barns and wells to support their new life. Promised irrigation wells and pumps from Pacific Land and Water never materialized. So instead most families used their smaller wells to water what they could.

The failure of the land to support crops eventually led residents to abandon Russian Settlement starting just a year after they arrived. In fact the decline was so swift Box Elder County decided school-age children should attend class in Rosette just a year after first establishing a one-room schoolhouse at Russian Settlement.

By 1917 everyone was gone and while Box Elder County residents removed buildings and materials from the site no one ever tried to make the area a home again. Today all that remains is a tiny cemetery with two graves surrounded by a picket fence.

Getting there

Travel 15.8 miles on UT-30 then turn left to stay with UT-30. Drive another 19.8 miles. Turn left on 54000 West. After 1 mile turn right on 16800 North. After about a tenth of a mile the road curves and becomes Board Ranch Road. Keep driving 6 miles. At the next available right turn right then continue 2.6 miles.

Honorable mentions for Utah ghost towns and beyond

Picking just 10 Utah ghost towns to highlight meant leaving out so many others. Some estimates suggest Utah includes over 100 ghost towns. Here we list just a few others that you may want to check out.

Cisco

No longer exactly a ghost town a woman named Eileen Muza purchased Cisco in 2015 making improvements and leaving her mark on the landscape ever since. But prior to that the town was featured as the location of Thelma and Louise’s famed police chase and also gave a Johnny Cash song its name.

Spring Canyon/Storrs

Jesse Knight purchased the land to develop a coal mine and company town he named Storrs after the mine superintendent in 1912. The name changed to Spring Canyon in 1924. It slowly declined as demand for coal decreased after World War II; by the late sixties no one called it home anymore.

Topaz

Not exactly a true ghost town Topaz deserves a place on the list because it once housed a number of people who do not live there today. Topaz was the site of a Japanese internment camp during World War II. Today a museum educates visitors about what happened there. Visitors can also tour the nearby camp site.

Notom

Notom just outside of Capitol Reef National Park doesn’t include buildings or even foundations to explore (that we know of!). But it made our list because of the accessibility to fun trails and outdoor activities. If you find yourself at the national park already you probably also spotted the remains of Fruita an early settlement. Notom just gives you more to explore either by vehicle or on foot.

Bannack Montana

This honorable mention isn’t in Utah but Bannack State Park is worth a trip if you find yourself in Montana. One of the state’s original territorial capitals is restored with buildings you can explore plus a museum and gift shop. Unlike most ghost towns it includes dozens of structures. It’s one of the more “complete” ghost towns available to tour.

Silt Colorado

Not only is Silt not in Utah it’s also not technically a ghost town. But if you drive I-70 between Moab and Denver you might as well stop at Silt. The town restored a number of historic buildings that visitors can explore right in the heart of Silt at Silt Historical Park.

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

After a season of performances that have taken place either virtually or in nontraditional settings Opera Columbus will begin its 2021-22 season back on its home turf of the Southern Theatre.

On Dec. 18 and 19 the company will perform a production of Giacomo Puccini’s 1900 opera “Tosca” in the Southern Theatre its pre-pandemic home.

“Maybe I am full of hope but it looks like by December we will all feel comfortable being in person in a theater together again” said General Director and CEO Julia Noulin-Merat who took over the job in January after the departure of the company’s longtime leader Peggy Kriha-Dye.

No small task:Opera Columbus production of 'La Boheme' challenging but rewarding

The 2021-22 season represents milestones for both the new director and the company itself: The season will be the first to be fully overseen by Noulin-Merat and also will be the company’s 40th season overall — an anniversary acknowledged in the decision to open with “Tosca.”

“It’s a valentine to our origin because Nov. 17 1981 was our first production — and it was ‘Tosca’” said Noulin-Merat 39 a native of Montreal who most recently held positions with the Boston Lyric Opera and Guerilla Opera also in Boston. “Also incidentally my birthday. All the stars were aligned for me to come to Columbus.”

Accompanied by the ProMusica Chamber Orchestra soprano Michelle Williams will star in the title role of Tosca. The elaborate production featuring a two-level set and new costumes inspired by the Netflix series “Bridgerton” represents a return to grand large-scale opera after scaled-down productions during the pandemic.

“I didn’t want to do ‘Tosca’ with six chorus members” Noulin-Merat said. “We want to do it right and we want to do it beautifully.”

(Somewhere around 18 chorus members are likely to sing in the December production though that number could change Noulin-Merat said.)

On Feb. 25 and 27 2022 the company will again join with ProMusica to perform the 2016 opera “Fellow Travelers” in the Southern Theatre. Composed by Gregory Spears the opera revolves around the so-called “Lavender Scare” a period beginning in the 1950s during which U.S. government workers who were gay faced firing due to their sexual orientation. Among the real-life figures depicted in the show is U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy.

Noulin-Merat wanted to program the opera she said because of its examination with how government power “intersects in people’s lives and love lives. To me that was very interesting.”

News:Patrons eager for increased capacity at live entertainment venues

To cap off its 40th season though the company plans to move out of the Southern Theatre and into the wider community. “40 Days of Opera” will feature both ticketed and free performances at sites throughout Columbus beginning May 4 and continuing for a total of 40 consecutive days.

Operatic programs will be performed in venues including the Columbus Museum of Art COSI and even a Downtown hotel. Some will be elaborately planned; others will be done pop-up-style.

“We are taking over the entire city and celebrating with everyone” Noulin-Merat said. “The idea is to explore what opera means to us within our community and not just at the theater.”

News:Opera Columbus will present 'Don Giovanni' before audiences

Taken in total the coming season represents an ambitious post-pandemic return for Opera Columbus — but one that Noulin-Merat has been thinking about since before she was even hired in her new job.

“This is the season I had pitched to the board when I was a finalist” she said “so we’ve been cooking on it for a while.”

In 2018 a far-right activist Tommy Robinson posted a video to YouTube claiming he had been attacked by an African migrant in Rome.

The thumbnail image and eight-word title promoting the video indicated Robinson was assaulted by a Black man outside a train station. Then in the video Robinson punched the man in the jaw dropping him to the ground.

The video was viewed more than 2.8 million times and it prompted news stories across the right-wing tabloids in Britain where Robinson was rapidly gaining notoriety for his anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic views.

For Caolan Robertson — a filmmaker who worked for Robinson and helped create the video — it was an instructional moment. It showed the key ingredients needed to attract attention on YouTube and other social media services.

The video played into anti-immigrant sentiments in Britain and across Europe. It also focused squarely on conflict cutting rapidly between shouts and shoves before showing Robinson’s punch. It also misrepresented what had actually happened.

“We would choose the most dramatic moment — or fake it and make it look more dramatic” Robertson 25 said in a recent interview. “We realized that if we wanted a future on YouTube it had to be driven by confrontation. Every time we did that kind of thing it would explode well beyond anything else.”

Robertson would go on to produce videos for a who’s who of right-wing YouTube personalities on both sides of the Atlantic including Lauren Southern Stefan Molyneux and Alex Jones.

The videos were tailored for the “echo chamber” that is often created by social media networks like YouTube. To keep you watching YouTube serves up videos similar to those you have watched before. But the longer someone watches the more extreme the videos can become.

“It can create these very radical people who are like gurus” said Guillaume Chaslot a former YouTube engineer who has been critical of the way the company’s algorithms pushed people to extreme content. “In terms of watch time a guru is wonderful.”

Tech companies regulators and individuals across the globe are struggling to understand and control the enormous power of YouTube and other social media services. In 2019 YouTube made “important changes to how we recommend videos and prevent the spread of misinformation and hateful content” Farshad Shadloo a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. It barred Molyneaux and Jones. But extreme videos continue to spread.

In time Robertson said he realized that the videos he worked on stoked dangerous hatred. And in 2019 at a conference in Britain run by a left-wing newspaper The Byline Times Robertson distanced himself from his work with the far-right. His change of heart was met with some skepticism.

“He was presented as a prodigal son” said Louise Raw an anti-fascist activist who was onstage for Robertson’s mea culpa. “But he has not been held to account.”

Now Robertson is detailing the ways he and his collaborators searched for confrontations to gain popularity on YouTube.

Efforts to contact Robinson were unsuccessful and Jones did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Southern said she should not be described as a far-right activist saying she is merely a conservative. She was not involved in “some horrible far-right grift that tried to deceive people into watching our content” she added. “We were just doing what any other YouTuber does.”

Raw footage of the episode in Rome provided by Robertson and reviewed by The New York Times shows that the YouTube video was edited to give the false impression that Robinson was threatened. The full footage shows he was the aggressor.

When the man noticed he was being filmed from across the street he approached the camera and Robinson shoved him into an oncoming car. As the man protested called Robinson crazy and told him to live his own life Robinson escalated the argument.

“There’s one way this is going to go” he told the man. “You’re going to end up knocked down unconscious.”

Over the more than two years he helped produce and publish videos for Robinson and others Robertson learned how making clever edits and focusing on confrontation could help draw millions of views on YouTube and other services. He also learned how YouTube’s recommendation algorithm often nudged people toward extreme videos.

“It meant that we did more and more extreme videos” Robertson said.

Robertson grew up in Ireland and after his parents divorced he moved with his father to a predominantly working-class area in the north of England. Realizing from a very young age that he is gay he often felt like an outsider. But he said he encountered more overt homophobia when he moved to London for college and walked through the largely Muslim neighborhoods at the East End of the city.

After the 2016 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando Florida — where a Muslim man pledging loyalty to the Islamic State group killed 49 people and wounded 53 more — Robertson developed an extreme animosity toward Muslims particularly immigrants. His anger was fueled in large part he said by videos he watched on YouTube.

He began watching videos from mainstream outlets like an episode of the HBO show “Real Time With Bill Maher” in which Sam Harris an author and a podcast host advocated greater criticism of Muslim beliefs. YouTube’s recommendation algorithm suggested more extreme videos involving personalities like Robinson a former member of the neo-fascist and white nationalist British National Party who was born Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.

In 2017 Robertson contacted Robinson and soon began working with him as a video producer. By the end of the year he was also collaborating with Southern an activist from Canada.

Knowing what garnered the most attention on YouTube Robertson said he and Southern would devise public appearances meant to generate conflict. That December they attended a women’s march in London and with Southern playing the part of a television reporter approached each woman with the same four-word question: “Women’s rights or Islam?”

They often received a confused measured or polite response according to Robertson. They continued to ask the question and sharpened it. Southern for example said it would be difficult for Muslim women to answer the question because their husbands would not let them attend the march. That caused anger to build in the crowd.

“It appears in the videos that we are just trying to figure out what is going on gather information understand people” Robertson said. “But really we were trying to find the most incendiary way of making them mad.”

The thumbnail image for the YouTube video was indicative of a confrontation: a woman screaming as Southern walked away. As he often did Robertson sharpened the video’s visual contrast — lightening the white colors and darkening the blacks — to subtly make the scene seem more dramatic.

Southern described the situation differently. “We asked the question because we knew it was going to force people to question their own political views and realize the contradiction in being a hard-core feminist but also supporting a religion that quite frankly has questionable practices around women” she said. And she added they used video techniques that any media company would use.

The next year Robertson and Southern traveled as far as South Africa Australia and New Zealand to create similar videos. Over the lifetime of Southern’s YouTube channel according to channel statistics reviewed by the Times her videos were viewed more than 63 million times.

More than 71% of people who viewed these videos had not subscribed to her YouTube channel. In 2018 at the height of her popularity at least 30% of the views occurred after the videos were automatically recommended to the viewer by YouTube’s algorithms.

Molyneux shied away from the kind of conflict that Southern embraced. He fashioned himself as an online philosopher. But the material Robertson edited slipped in “far-right ideas that appealed to the ethnonationalists — the extreme right-wing audience” he said.

In 2018 the pair traveled to Poland for a video that painted the country as a place free of hardship and strife. The subtext was that was because Poland is predominantly white. In an email to the Times Molyneux said “It was nice being in a country wherein I didn’t have to hire protective security.” He added that he felt the same way when he visited Hong Kong.

By early 2019 Robertson said he grew disillusioned. There was a noticeable drop in traffic on Southern’s YouTube channel. Around the same time YouTube began to remove more videos the company thought encouraged violence and spread misinformation.

After an Australian man killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch New Zealand — driven in part by anti-immigrant beliefs propagated by YouTube — Robertson realized he said that the videos he had made led to the same kind of violence in the Orlando nightclub in 2016.

“I felt like I had gone full circle that day” he said.

Now Robertson oversees Byline TV a video offshoot of The Byline Times. He also runs a new organization Future of Freedom which seeks to de-radicalize right-wing extremists. He is still counting YouTube views.

Robertson recently boasted in a text that in one day a video targeting Jones the conspiracy theorist he once worked with had been viewed more than 250000 times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0c20uY29tL2xvY2FsL2Zyb20tc291dGhlcm4tbmV3LW1leGljby12aXJnaW4tZ2FsYWN0aWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtZmlyc3QtaHVtYW4tc3BhY2VmbGlnaHQtaW4tdHdvLXllYXJzL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0c20uY29tL2xvY2FsL2Zyb20tc291dGhlcm4tbmV3LW1leGljby12aXJnaW4tZ2FsYWN0aWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtZmlyc3QtaHVtYW4tc3BhY2VmbGlnaHQtaW4tdHdvLXllYXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Southern New Mexico Virgin Galactic launches first human spaceflight in two years,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.ktsm.com/local/from-southern-new-mexico-virgin-galactic-launches-first-human-spaceflight-in-two-years/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0c20uY29tL2xvY2FsL2Zyb20tc291dGhlcm4tbmV3LW1leGljby12aXJnaW4tZ2FsYWN0aWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtZmlyc3QtaHVtYW4tc3BhY2VmbGlnaHQtaW4tdHdvLXllYXJzL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0c20uY29tL2xvY2FsL2Zyb20tc291dGhlcm4tbmV3LW1leGljby12aXJnaW4tZ2FsYWN0aWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtZmlyc3QtaHVtYW4tc3BhY2VmbGlnaHQtaW4tdHdvLXllYXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Two Southwest Airlines planes made contact on the ground at Midway International Airport shortly after noon Friday.

One plane was taxiing out for departure when its wing struck the tail of another aircraft according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

Flight 654 was heading out from Chicago for Birmingham Alabama while Flight 751 was arriving from Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.

The FAA is investigating and said both planes will be inspected before they fly again.

The carrier's entire fleet of Boeing 737 jets is equipped with gate-to-gate Wi-Fi so you'll have no trouble remaining productive inflight. Satellite-based internet coverage is available on every Southwest route including the carrier's rapidly growing Hawaii service and flights to international destinations like Costa Rica and Jamaica.

But that's not all. Southwest's Wi-Fi pricing is actually one of the best deals in town too.

Last week I flew with Southwest for the first time in nearly 18 months and connected to the internet during the two-hour hop from Denver to Las Vegas. While the speeds — 10 Mbps download but just 0.55 Mbps upload — were on par for airplane Wi-Fi what really caught my eye was the reasonable pricing.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Connecting costs just $8 regardless of the device that you're using. For a fee-based service I was impressed. Of course it'd be great if Southwest offered free Wi-Fi like JetBlue does but I found the cost to be quite reasonable.

I recently flew a similar two-and-a-half hour hop from Salt Lake City to Dallas with Delta and at $17 the carrier wanted more than double what Southwest charges. In fact I've been logging how much I spend on inflight Wi-Fi since late 2019 and only once have I paid less than $8 on a legacy carrier. It was a United flight from Newark to Costa Rica where the Wi-Fi cut out once we departed U.S. airspace.

In addition to charging just $8 Southwest's Wi-Fi comes with an incredible perk — it includes all-day access. That means that the $8 Wi-Fi package can be used across all connecting flights on the same day as your initial purchase.

So whether you're flying nonstop from San Diego to Chicago or from Fort Lauderdale to Spokane via San Antonio and Las Vegas an internet pass will cost just $8. You'll just need to log in using your credentials to unlock internet access on any subsequent same-day flights but you won't be charged.

Compared to the legacy carriers in the U.S. that's outright generous. In my experience the majority of flights operated by American Airlines and United aren't eligible for an all-day Wi-Fi pass. Some Delta jets are but it's never priced at just $8.

If you'd prefer to save the cash Southwest's inflight entertainment will still have you covered. The carrier offers a host of on-demand content through its Wi-Fi portal including a selection of 12 live TV channels and 49 pre-loaded movies with the full list of titles available here.

Additionally every Southwest passenger can enjoy free messaging through Apple's iMessage or Facebook's WhatsApp application without purchasing a dedicated internet package. In the U.S. only Alaska and Delta offer free inflight messaging networkwide.

There is one downside to Southwest's generous Wi-Fi offering. The carrier's jets aren't equipped with power outlets so staying connected during a long day of travel will likely require a power bank or a quick charge at the gate between flights.

So long as your devices are juiced up you can't beat Southwest's reasonably priced Wi-Fi offering.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3BkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9teXJ0bGUtYmVhY2gtYnVzaW5lc3Mtb3duZXJzLWhvcGUtbmV3LXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHRzLWJvb3N0LWxvY2FsLWVjb25vbXnSAXRodHRwczovL3dwZGUuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL215cnRsZS1iZWFjaC1idXNpbmVzcy1vd25lcnMtaG9wZS1uZXctc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWZsaWdodHMtYm9vc3QtbG9jYWwtZWNvbm9teQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Myrtle Beach business owners hope new Southwest Airlines flights boost economy,"The Grand Strand just got more connected to the rest of the country.

New Southwest Airlines flights to Hawaii will offer more opportunities for local residents to travel to the mainland Big Island tourism officials say.

Southwest earlier this month announced it will launch new nonstop flights from Las Vegas Los Angeles and Phoenix to a number of Hawaiian destinations — including Kailua-Kona — in the coming weeks and months.

Nonstop once-daily flights between Las Vegas and Kailua-Kona begin on Sept. 7 while a daily flight between Los Angeles and Kailua-Kona will start June 27. Flights between Phoenix and Kailua-Kona begin Sept. 7.

“We delivered on the second most-asked request we’ve heard from people in Hawaii — after we answered a call to offer affordable interisland flying as part of our initial entry into Hawaii in spring 2019 — by connecting Hawaii with nonstop service to Las Vegas ‘the ninth island’ …” Andrew Watterson chief commercial officer and executive vice president for Southwest Airlines said in a news release.

Southwest also will offer additional flights to neighbor islands from San Diego Long Beach San Jose and Oakland including a new once-daily nonstop flight between San Diego and Kailua-Kona beginning June 27.

Service from Kona to San Diego initially will operate Monday Wednesday Friday and Saturday and increase to daily service on Sept. 7.

“We’re building on an era of affordability that Southwest initiated for Hawaii air travel” Watterson said. “These new flights bring Hawaii service closer to more of our customers who live near airports across the west and make it possible to choose Southwest to fly between the Aloha State and cities as far east as Nashville without spending an entire overnight in the air.

“We believe Southwest offers an economy product to Hawaii which customers will find comfortable and seating with ample legroom for all free onboard entertainment for all flexible policies for all and our multi-award winning warmth of hospitality seamlessly aligns with the aloha spirit.”

It’s “absolutely great news” that Big Island residents now have more direct access to the mainland said Ross Birch executive director of the Island of Hawaii Visitors Bureau.

While there will be greater demand for travel to Hawaii from the mainland throughout the year Birch said Southwest will provide benefit to residents looking to fly out of the state.

“These are areas where most of our local residents are frequenting. … We see this as a great opportunity for local residents (to) travel on the mainland and (have) accessibility to the mainland.”

The additional flights also will have a slight effect on pricing which Birch said is favorable for both visitors and residents.

Having more seats to meet demand helps “to keep those prices in a good spot for us” he said.

According to Birch this will be the first time the Big Island has had direct access to Las Vegas while other routes are “well serviced by other carriers.”

Birch said the visitors bureau is anticipating that Big Island arrival numbers through May and the summer will be “equal to if not surpassing our 2019 arrivals.”"

The Edward has 13 ingredients and got a barista fired when they complained about the over-the-top beverage on social media. But just for fun Inside Edition asked another barista Brett Danger of Tanner’s Coffee Company to show how it’s made.

“Right today we're going to be making the Edward but as I would like to call it the Edweird because I don't get it” Brett Danger said.

According to the barista the first ingredient in the drink is bananas. “We're going to start with the bananas because there's five of them. And either there was a banana deficiency or a potassium deficiency or they really liked bananas or they liked the texture that it gives them” he said. “I would say probably one will give it that creamy texture that you desire. Five is going to increase volume. It's also going to give the barista that German Shepherd head-tilt.”

The next ingredient is extra caramel drizzle. “And when someone says they want extra caramel drizzle what they really mean is they want it to be murdered with caramel” Brett adds.

After that he adds cinnamon syrup caramel crunch a pump of honey extra coffee extra ice frappe chips and heavy cream.

But that’s not all: the Edward is double-blended. “So you get double-blended one because it does make it smoother and have a better consistency” Brett points out. “But also when you have this much stuff you got to double-blend it or else it's going to kind of have like a cottage-cheese look where it's blended but it doesn't flow.”

After that he adds caramel crunchies salt and whipped cream. “Bam. All right here we go. Ladies and gentlemen that looks really good“ Brett says.

Brett says that the drink is a little less than $15 and there was enough to make three 24-ounce cups. “But when you spend 15 bucks on this” he points out “please bring enough to still tip your barista.”

And when this barista was asked if there are some ways to improve the Edward he had a few ideas. “I would do one half or one banana. Heavy cream is fine. I'd probably I would cold brew. Not frappé roast or espresso. Or actually here's what I would do — I would do no coffee but I would do two shots of espresso affogato kind of sounds like avocado where you put them on top and then it kind of sinks down into the bottom. So that way when you blend it and you can't pour the extra out they don't pour any of your espresso.”

He lastly adds “There you have it. The Brett. The Brett Danger.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbWlzYmFyLmNvbS9lbi9mYWN0Y2hlY2svMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9zdGFyYnVja3MtZG9lcy1ub3Qtc3VwcG9ydC1pc3JhZWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks is Not on BDS List | Misbar,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2Nvbm9yZWNvcmQuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDUvMjMvc29tZS1yb3V0ZS05NDAtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRzLXNlZS1wcm9ncmVzcy1vdGhlcnMtc3RhbGxlZC1wb2Nvbm8tc3ByaW5ncy13YXdhLXNoZWV0ei1zdGFyYnVja3MvNDk0MDAzNTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some Route 940 developments see progress others stall,"No commitment required.

The 1993 book Tastes of Paradise: A Social History of Spices Stimulants and Intoxicants explored the oft-stated theory that the real catalyst behind the industrial revolution was caffeine -- specifically the kind you get from guzzling coffee. Author Wolfgang Schivelbusch's premise is that when 18th-century families ditched cold brews (yes back then it was a beverage for the whole clan regardless of age or heavy machinery usage) for hot cups of Joe western civilization went into hyper-productive mode.

David Lynch seven cups a day (when brainstorming)

The awesomely odd auteur's caffeinated characters who populate his fictionalized town of Twin Peaks made a ""damn good cup of coffee"" cool way before Starbucks became STARBUCKS™.

Said the celluloid scientist of his secret sauce in a past interview ""I [used to eat] at Bob's Big Boy. I would go at 2:30 after the lunch rush. I ate a chocolate shake and four five six seven cups of coffee -- with lots of sugar. And there's lots of sugar in that chocolate shake. It's a thick shake. In a silver goblet. I would get a rush from all this sugar and I would get so many ideas! I would write them on these napkins. It was like I had a desk with paper. All I had to do was remember to bring my pen but a waitress would give me one if I remembered to return it at the end of my stay. I got a lot of ideas at Bob's.""

Peaks Freaks can take what they will from the fact that Lynch wrote at a restaurant called ""Bob's.""

Following ‘House Of Gucci’ Filming,"After spending two months in Rome shooting her new film Lady Gaga was spotted enjoying a casual moment while getting coffee in a pair of heather short shorts.

If you saw Lady Gaga on Monday (May 17) you wouldn’t be faulted for thinking this is not the same woman who once wore a dress made out of meat. Gaga 35 was the picture of casual comfort while running errands in Los Angeles. The “Rain On Me” singer was spotted in a tie-dye hoodie and short-shorts while picking up some coffee at a Starbucks in Malibu. Her hair was put up in a messy half-updo and she finished her outfit with a pair of colorful Nikes. Considering this is the same woman who busted out four different looks at the Met Gala in 2019 it’s a bit shocking to see her in such a low-key look but considering how hard she’s been working Gaga deserves to keep it casual.

Gaga returned to LA after spending two months filming House of Gucci in Rome Italy. Gaga portrays Patrizia Reggiani the former wife of Maurizio Gucci in the Ridley Scott-directed biopic. Adam Driver will play Maurizio alongside a star-studded cast that includes Salma Hayek Al Pacino Jeremy Irons Reeve Carney and Jared Leto. The story depicts how Patrizia “plotted to kill her husband the grandson of renowned fashion designer Guccio Gucci” and is expected to arrive in November 2021.

To pull off the Gucci look Gaga needed quite the wardrobe. She was already an avant-garde fashion icon and a glamorous fashionista before filming House of Gucci but the photos taken of her on and off-set raised her profile to a new level. The first photo of Gaga showed she captured the calm and calculating “aura” of Patrizia who was dubbed “The Black Widow” during her high-profile trial in the late 1990s per The New York Times. Subsequent paparazzi shots showed her channeling “businesswoman realness” and wedding-day eleganza. It’s hard to pick which of her memorable House of Gucci looks was the best – and the movie hasn’t even come out yet!

Perhaps the best “look” came at the start of April. While wearing her dark hair in a fierce look Gaga took a moment to freshen her breath by brushing her teeth between takes. This down-to-earth moment was similar to the same casual vibe of her coffee run on Monday proving that Gaga can bring the Avant the elegance and the realness. We’ll see if she can bring home the Oscar when House of Gucci is unveiled in November 2021.

“It was definitely worth the wait” said Elsrod who scored four goals in the fourth quarter. “I think this is one of our best performances as a team because we were able to get outside shots looks in center counter attacks we got a little bit of everything. This game was a lot of fun.”

Princeton scored the opening goal 1 minutes 26 seconds into the game but the Cardinals led 5-1 after the first period. Senior Donnie Richardson had three of his four goals in the first.

“There was no panic at all because we knew they were going to come out fighting” Richardson said. “We came out with a lot of grit. Shooting isn’t my top thing but when I need to shoot I can shoot. It came down to my teammates setting it all up.”

Senior Lukas Rakowsky had three goals for the Cardinals and senior Austin Grzybicki added the other. Senior goalie Chase Bateman had 15 saves.

“I took a gap year to focus on swimming but the boys got me back here and it was worth it” Bateman said. “I was a field player before this year but I went in goal and I have loved it. I have the best shooters in the state shooting on me every single day in practice and it’s made me better.”

The Cardinals reached the final in the four-team state tournament by defeating Cincinnati St. Xavier 11-8 in a semifinal earlier in the day. Princeton defeated Upper Arlington 13-9 in the other semifinal.

“We just played our game and trusted that we were going to come through” first-year St. Charles coach Andrew Hoffman said. “We had seen Princeton and knew their offense and knew what they could do.”

Golden Bears rough up

Bombers to place third

Avery Voss’ five goals and four from Clark Pabst helped a second-half surge as UA pulled away from St. Xavier winning 18-7 in the third-place game.

The Bombers scored three consecutive goals to erase a 5-0 deficit late in the first half but the Golden Bears scored the final two goals of the second quarter and the last three of the third to take a 13-4 lead.

UA which finished 24-5-1 was coming off a loss to Princeton in its semifinal.

“Our guys fought back really hard. They showed up” UA coach J.J. Spangler said. “Everyone did their job and that’s all I could have asked. They played fast and strong basic things that have made us good all year. We controlled the ball and didn’t turn it over (in the second half). That’s our No. 1 thing being able to outswim other teams make them tired and make them make mistakes.”

Patrick Ray and Thomas Ray each added two goals for the Bears.

Drew Mussman scored twice to lead St. Xavier.

It is once again home to a new top-of-the-line radiotherapy system that will improve the hospital's capabilities and will allow doctors to focus more on patients and treatments instead of systems and technology.

The TrueBeam radiotherapy equipment was unveiled Friday afternoon during a ceremony at St. Francis.

The purchase of the machine was made possible through a new partnership between St. Francis the Kansas City health system Ardent Health Services and the University of Kansas Cancer Center.

""The cancer care team at The University of Kansas Health System St. Francis Campus already has a reputation for providing compassionate high-quality care"" St. Francis CEO Steve Anderson said. ""Now through this expanded partnership the team in Topeka will have access to more technology and care resources.""

According to Shalina Gupta-Burt the hospital's radiation oncology medical director the machine can deliver precision high doses of radiation and quick and shortened radiation courses.

""For us in Topeka it's going to be extremely important"" Gupta-Burt.

The addition of the machine will allow St. Francis to not have to send patients elsewhere such as The University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City which also has a TrueBeam.

""Over the last year and a half or two I've probably had to send probably around a dozen patients"" Gupta-Burt said.

The machine can also be used on a variety of cancer cases achieves results with speed and accuracy and move and adjust to fit the specific needs of the cancer patient's tumor.

""What it's really gonna allow me to do is localize deliver assure that they are treating only the disease that we need to treat as safely as we can"" Gupta-Burt said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhpZ2hlcmVkLmNvbS9hZG1pc3Npb25zL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMS8wNS8yNC9zdC1ub3JiZXJ0LWNvbGxlZ2VzLXVubGlrZWx5LWdvb2QteWVhci1hZG1pc3Npb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Norbert College's unlikely good year in admissions,"We've all heard the conventional wisdom about this year's admissions class: students will still travel far if they get into Harvard or Stanford University. Or the University of California Berkeley or the University of Virginia. Or maybe to a college in a hip urban area. But other than those categories this year of the pandemic is likely to be a tough one for colleges seeking students.

St. Norbert College would not seem likely to have a good admissions year. It admits the vast majority of the students who apply. It is located in De Pere Wis. (a small city near Green Bay) which gets quite cold for much of the year. It has distinctions of course. It's a liberal arts college but that hasn't been helping colleges outside the Amherst and Swarthmore-type institutions. It's the only Norbertine institution of higher education in the world named for Norbert of Xanten founder of the Norbertine order born in Germany in 1080. But that's hardly a driver for enrollment.

So why does St. Norbert College have 609 people who have committed as freshmen for the fall? St. Norbert had a target of 560 and President Brian J. Bruess said that the college typically isn't hurt by summer melt. In fact he said he expects St. Norbert to gain as many students as it loses to summer melt or a few more meaning it could top its all-time record for a class of 620. Last year as the pandemic was starting the freshman class had only 430 students.

Not only is St. Norbert landing more students it is attracting more diverse array of students. The incoming class is 17 percent minority a low figure for much of higher education. But for St. Norbert that's up from 13 percent last year and an all-time record.

This is also on track to be tied for the most academically prepared class with a high school grade point average of 3.57.

So how is it that St. Norbert is smiling while so many other colleges are suffering?

Bruess said that one key factor was that the college was open this entire academic year and closed to students only last spring when the pandemic first broke out in the United States.

""The prospective students noticed this and commented on it"" he said. ""The campus visit is so important.""

""We re-engineered the entire tour -- focusing on what they could see safely.""

Mark Selin executive director of enrollment and marketing said ""People really wanted those visits. We had to make it work and we did.""

Of course the college had safety protocols in place with social distancing and face masks. When the college restored campus tours (last June before most other colleges) it had special conditions attached originally escorting only one family at a time. But throughout the last year families commented on the fact that the college offered the tours.

On Presidents Day the college came up with the idea that Bruess would lead the tours and he led two families around the campus in 12-degree weather. The families (who were friends) were touring three colleges. One of the other colleges closed because of the weather and one closed tours that day because of COVID-19. St. Norbert enrolled the students.

""We wanted not to get mired in crisis management"" Bruess said. The college had to take COVID-19 seriously he said but it could also move ahead on other priorities.

One of the college's goals given its location in the upper Midwest is to diversify where students come from. The local and near-local population is declining especially compared to the South and the West. In last year's class St. Norbert had 11 states represented. This year it had 24 states represented.

Selin said much of the credit for that success is with sports coaches (28 percent of the student body are athletes). By recruiting in new states he said they hope they will create momentum that will help next year and beyond. ""We've been trying to expand our base"" he said ""and this year we really had opportunities.""

He described a campus visit from an athlete from Alaska. The college managed to get a local alumnus who majored in the field the student wanted to study to meet with him. The student enrolled.

In terms of spending on aid St. Norbert didn't break the bank.

Its discount rate is a little below 50 percent below the national average and Bruess said it has been stable. And the college has exceeded its goal for net tuition revenue and per-student net tuition revenue goal.

For a college that admits most of the students who apply the key is doing enough things to attract a larger applicant base. Bruess said the numbers show the college doing that.

Applications Admits Admit Rate 2019 3352 2661 79 percent 2020 3346 2815 84 percent 2021 4057 3444 84 percent

""We really spent more time searching for students and that paid off"" Bruess said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5va2xhaG9tYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzA1LzIzL29rbGFob21hLXN0YXRlLXNvZnRiYWxsLWNvd2dpcmxzLWJlYXQtbWlzc2lzc2lwcGktc3RhdGUtcmVhY2gtbmNhYS1zdXBlci1yZWdpb25hbHMvNTIzMzcyNDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OSU softball: Cowgirls beat Mississippi St. reach NCAA Super Regionals,"STILLWATER — Sydney Pennington remembers how exciting it was when the Oklahoma State softball team won its regional two years ago.

Thrill jolted through the team that day in 2019.

Even after her record-setting home run on Sunday Pennington noticed a different feeling for No. 5 overall seed OSU following a 10-2 run-rule victory over Mississippi State in the Stillwater Regional final at Cowgirl Stadium.

“Now it’s just expected” said Pennington who became the all-time home run leader in Cowgirl history with her third-inning solo shot. “I was thinking in the last inning it’s crazy how much the dynamic here has changed and the mentality because I remember how excited and crazy we were a couple years ago.

“It’s cool to see that change over time. I’m really proud of everybody. I think we’re headed in the right direction.”

The victory on Sunday sent OSU to the super regional round for the second time in three years.

The Cowgirls will face Big 12 foe Texas yet again after the Longhorns weathered a lengthy rain delay to beat Oregon 1-0 after 1 a.m. CT Monday in the Austin Regional final. OSU is 4-0 against Texas this season.

After falling behind 1-0 in the bottom of the first Oklahoma State got its offense going in the second inning. Karli Petty singled and Reagan Wright homered to center field for a 2-1 Cowgirl lead.

That signaled to OSU coach Kenny Gajewski that the offensive firepower his team has been playing with over the last several weeks was ready to ignite.

“It’s really cool for me and our staff to watch us hit the way we’ve hit over the last eight nine weeks now” Gajewski said. “This team something happened where they were tired of just being average. When they were tired of that it’s just really changed.

“We’re starting to be the offensive force that I thought this team could be.”

The Cowgirls scored two more runs in the second inning then Pennington came through with her record-setting home run in the third. It was the 36th home run of Pennington’s career passing Tiffany Mikkelson for the most in Cowgirl history.

“The last couple weeks I’ve just been focusing on taking quality at-bats and not do too much and I think that’s helped me a lot” Pennington said. “I knew today I could break that record but nothing has changed in my mind in the box. I’ve tried to stay patient and let it work out on its own.

“When I hit it I thought it was gonna go over but I wasn’t sure. It was kind of a high pitch. It was awesome. I couldn’t stop smiling after that. It was fun. It was a good moment.”

In the top of the fourth inning OSU loaded the bases for one of its hottest hitters Alysen Febrey who went 6-for-8 in the regional. She drew a walk to force in a run and Hayley Busby followed with a grand slam to cap off the scoring.

OSU starting pitcher Carrie Eberle allowed two runs on six hits with eight strikeouts to improve to 22-3 on the season.

The Cowgirls are in pursuit of their ninth Women’s College World Series appearance and will be making their third super regional trip. OSU won the super regional in Stillwater in 2011 and won at Florida State in 2019.

“I’m very very proud of this program” said Gajewski who is in his sixth season. “Another great moment in our time here continuing to build on what the great players of the past have done.”

Kennedy (T-AO 208) began at the General Dynamics-National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (GD-NASSCO) shipyard May 21.

Robert F. Kennedy will be the fourth John Lewis-class ship the new generation of US Navy replenishment oilers. The first ship-in-class was launched in January 2021.

The John Lewis-class ships are based on commercial design standards and will recapitalize the current T-AO 187 Class Fleet Replenishment Oilers to provide underway replenishment of fuel to U.S. Navy ships and jet fuel for aircraft assigned to aircraft carriers. These ships are part of the Navy’s Combat Logistics Force and will become the backbone of the fuel delivery system.

T-AO 208 will be operated by the Navy’s Military Sealift Command and is the first ship named after the Navy veteran former U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator from New York.

“USNS Robert F. Kennedy will provide significant contributions to the fleet serving as the primary fuel pipeline to refuel ships at sea. The building of the John Lewis-class ships marks an important milestone in enhancing our Navy’s fleet capabilities and providing critical support to our Sailors”

According to a U.S. Congress report the U.S. Navy procured its first John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler in FY2016 (Fiscal Year) and a total of six have been procured through FY2021 including the fifth and sixth in FY2020.

The U.S. Navy wants to procure a total of 20 TAO-205s. The ships have an estimated unit procurement cost of roughly $650 million when purchased at a rate of two ships per year and something more than that when purchased at a rate of one ship per year. The ships are being built by General Dynamics/National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (GD/NASSCO) of San Diego CA.

The U.S. Navy’s existing force of fleet oilers consists of 15 Henry J. Kaiser (TAO-187) class ships commonly called Kaiser-class oilers for short. These ships were procured between FY1982 and FY1989 and entered service between 1986 and 1996. They have an expected service life of 35 years; the first ship in the class will reach that age in 2021. The ships are about 677 feet long and have a full load displacement of about 41000 tons including about 26500 tons of fuel and other cargo.

The TAO-205 class design will have capabilities similar to those of the Kaiser-class ships and will rely on existing technologies rather than new technologies. To guard against oil spills TAO-205s are to be double-hulled like modern commercial oil tankers with a space between the two hulls to protect the inner hull against events that puncture the outer hull.

The John Lewis-class replenishment oiler for the U.S. Navy has a length of 227.4 m a beam of 32.4 a draft of 10.2 m and a full load displacement of 49850 tons. The ships can carry 156000 barrels of oil and have increased dry cargo storage over the Henry J. Kaiser class. There will be stations on both sides of each ship for underway replenishment of fuel and stores and will have two dry cargo transfer rigs.

The John Lewis-class will be powered by two medium-speed Fairbanks-Morse MAN 12V48/60CR diesel engines driving two shafts. She will be able to reach a top speed of 20 knots (37 km/f) with a maximum cruising range of 6147 nautical miles (11384 km). The ship will have a flight deck for one helicopter.",,,,,,

TrueNAS CORE AMD EPYC

At the start of this adventure to be honest I never even thought about Supermicro for these Mini ITX boards. What a fun tool though for builds like these though. The boards are obviously small but they’re very well equipped and in this case include enterprise-ish processors. That’s important for TrueNAS CORE as this gets us access to out-of-band management ECC DRAM and a PCIe slot for faster connectivity.

I went with the AMD EPYC 3201 SoC Processor which offers 8 cores and 8 threads. This board runs about $550 at NewEgg’s eBay shop Amazon has them too from time to time about the same price. This board was a big splurge given the $800 budget. Supermicro does offer two more boards in this family that have fewer cores and/or threads. If you’re not looking for as much performance it would be easy to save over $100.

TrueNAS CORE AMD EPYC – The Rest of the Parts

Because I spent so much on this board I had to make compromises elsewhere. The first of these was DRAM. I was able to secure a set of SK hynix PC4-2400T-RD1- 11 DDR4 ECC 8GB DRAM modules to get me to 16GB total. The good news is that eBay has a ton of DRAM and it’s pretty easy to make offers until you hit your price target. I was about $60 in on the RAM.

Another compromise I had to make was on the power supply. I did find a like-new Thermaltake 500W PSU on B&H. They had a nice selection of used PSUs that will save some coin this one was about $40. Lastly on the compromise side of the house I bought a used 10GbE card off eBay. There are plenty of options here. I ended up with an old HP card for about $20. The downside is that it came with many of the support pins broken. I solved the worst offender with a wire tie. Not exactly perfect but the job got done.

Lastly I went with the Fractal Design Node 304 enclosure. I wanted to spend a little more here and get something with HDD hot-swap support but at the end of the day the 304 won out for its size and at $80 its affordability. I’m hopeful the system works well enough that I don’t have to go into the enclosure very often for service but that is a trade-off with this build. On the upside my system looks pretty nice and there should be plenty of air movement with the installed fans that come with the case.

Final Thoughts

There’s a lot I like about this build. The small board with 8 threads and cores is great I get ECC DRAM and out of band management. It’s a little limited with just 4 SATA ports but I do get the NVMe SSD slot which puts me ahead of the other two builds potentially. This does mean I have to blow a SATA bay for the OS or live on the edge and install via USB drive. You should be able to guess which way I’ll go.

The biggest issue for me is that I rolled the dice on a shady NIC and some DRAM that’s seen better days. Oh and I have to assemble the pieces. For many homelabbers this is no big deal but the last time I assembled a PC Bill Clinton was our president. But now it’s on to performance testing to see how these systems turn up.

Along with their wives they were seen at their swanky private club where pillars of the local business scene gather to celebrate their rarefied status.

As it turned out the dinner was anything but a celebration. It’s unclear exactly what was said but presumably Stankey told his old crony that he was about to unwind the final remaining vestige of their costly empire-building fantasy that evaporated billions of dollars in shareholder value over the past decade.

This past Monday AT&T made it official and announced it was spinning off its WarnerMedia conglomerate defenestrating brands such as CNN HBO and Warner Studios into an odd new company that will be run by a smallish rival Discovery Inc.

Again I can’t say exactly what went down during the dinner but with the deal Stankey all but admitted to corporate America that the last 10 years of his career — and Stephenson’s — was a significant waste of time.

The story of AT&T’s disaster is one of hubris (these guys thought they could remake a world that didn’t need remaking) and ego (they thought they could do no wrong until it was glaringly obvious they were doing so).

It’s also a story about staying in your lane. What looks good on paper often falls apart in the execution when you’re spread so painfully thin.

Wall Street-types who have been following the Steph & Stank show say the signs the duo were operationally unequipped to “transform” AT&T came as early as 2011. That’s when they attempted to buy Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile unit for $39 billion.

The duo was so confident (that ­hubris thing again) they could get the deal through the Obama Department of Justice that they even negotiated a whopping $6 billion breakup fee if it failed as a way to get DT to the bargaining table.

And guess what: The Obama DOJ did what many observers (except Steph & Stank) saw coming a mile away and said “no go” because the merger would eliminate a wireless carrier and possibly cause consumers to pay more for service.

Steph & Stank were left licking their wounds and paying John Legere then the flamboyant CEO of T-Mobile known for his long hair and leather jackets that $6 billion fee. Legere of course is a perfect foil for the buttoned-down Texas suits — both optically and as it turns out operationally. He quickly rebranded T-Mobile as “Un-Carrier” and began a massive expansion including the acquisition of Sprint. His stock price soared.

Still undeterred in their quest for greatness Steph & Stank then conjured up the odd notion that getting into the satellite-TV business was the key to success. They bought DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015 apparently unaware that the streaming revolution and cord cutting was making this business increasingly worthless.

In 2016 came the $85 billion deal for Warner (then called Time Warner) that suddenly made the Texas suits players in media (CNN) cable (HBO) and Hollywood (Warner Bros).

AT&T’s acquisition of DirecTV proved to be a colossal failure as the satellite-TV business was becoming history as streaming services became the norm. AP

Again it all sounded good on paper. But with so much time dedicated to buying Warner integrating it into the larger company and defending it to then-President Donald Trump’s antitrust police who challenged the deal Steph & Stank seemed to ignore just about everything else.

AT&T’s rollout of the next generation of wireless connectivity superfast 5G has now lagged significantly behind T-Mobile and by having to focus on media so much Steph & Stank allowed other competitors to get into the game at a faster clip.

Assets such as the floundering Direct­TV unit remained a drag on earnings because people hated the service even if you could get “Game of Thrones” at a discount.

Steph & Stank were slow as Texas molasses to answer the Netflix and Amazon streaming juggernauts with something called HBO Max that came online only last year.

Through it all Steph & Stank remained confident at least publicly. Shares were getting crushed and an activist investor demanded changes but Stephenson and his board last year appointed Stankey as new CEO.

Almost as soon as Stephenson was out of the way and on to retirement Stankey sold a chunk of DirecTV now valuing the asset at a fraction of its original cost. Ditto for the ill-fated Warner purchase which after the Discovery deal will fetch AT&T only about $43 billion of the $85 billion it spent on buying the assets not to mention the countless millions the company invested to fight the DOJ. (AT&T ultimately prevailed in court.)

AT&T officials say on paper the deal is closer to a wash because of cash flow produced over the past three years and other savings but they don’t deny the mistake in strategy. Plus you got to hand it to Stankey. That he still has his job as CEO is a testament to his willingness to throw his boss and himself under the proverbial bus. On the other hand he ­really didn’t have much choice given what went down at AT&T.

But if you’re a shareholder do you really trust this guy to run the show?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9oeWF0dHMtdGhvbXBzb24td2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1kYy1ob3RlbC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thompson Washington DC Hotel By Hyatt: Review,"Earlier this month I stayed at the Thompson Washington DC Hotel. It’s in a neighborhood where I haven’t spent much time before and my first experience with the brand that Hyatt acquired when it acquired Two Roads Hospitality.

When I moved to D.C. as an intern after college around 25 years ago one of the first pieces of advice I got as a young naive white boy in the nation’s capital was “don’t get on the Green Line.” Now the Capitol Riverfront area is completely gentrified and it’s also home to the Washington Nationals stadium.

The Thompson Washington DC hotel is right by much of the new action. It’s still not fully operational due to Covid – its rooftop bar area has just re-opened but its Danny Meyer restaurant has not.



Thompson Washington DC Hotel

Thompson Hotels is one of Lucky‘s new favorite hotel brands and I still hadn’t stayed at one so I decided to give it a shot for my first work trip in 14 months. It felt good to be back on the road. The property is right next to the Department of Transportation too so folks involved in aviation may find themselves here from time to time as well (and in the Starbucks located right beside it).



Pete Buttigieg’s Office

Everyone at the hotel was friendly and wanted to be helpful though execution wasn’t always great. There was a short line at check-in when I arrived but I was welcomed shortly after. Reception is just to the right when you enter the hotel and I found that area to be rather spartan though the rest of the lobby was brighter and more stylish.

During the check-in process it was explained to me that Globalist breakfast would be delivered to the room. They give you a sheet listing options of bagels bagel egg sandwiches fruit and yogurt plus coffee and juice to choose from and delivery times of 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. (which in my opinion is too late they need a 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. option). You need to bring the sheet back down to the lobby the evening before or they can take your order by phone.

Only half my order was actually delivered. It turns out they just forgot the second paper bag which they brought up after I rang the front desk. Coffee is also available in the lobby usually from 7 a.. I was told but they were happy to set it out early when I asked. Coffee needs to be available when guests get up before their business day not just on the way out of the hotel.



Breakfast Bag Delivered To Room

There was some confusion at check-in over whether I’d confirmed a suite (I did). My wife and daughter came with me on the trip because they hadn’t been to D.C. in some time either. What I needed was a separate room for my daughter that I could close the door to when she naps in the afternoon and when she goes to sleep hours before we do. The hotel gave us two connecting rooms. They also promised 10000 points for the trouble. Nice!

View From Room

I can’t tell you how much I appreciate a room with a refrigerator. If it had a microwave too that would be perfection. I landed in DC and went straight to Elephant Jumps in Northern Virginia for Thai food before checking into the hotel. I’m going to slightly over-order just so I can try more things. This lets me bring back the leftovers because the second meal will still be orders of magnitude better than my next-best option.



Refrigerator

The hotel’s valet dinged my rental car or rather wherever they parked it the car next to it dinged the car in two places – hitting the driver’s door and creating a significant indenture and hitting the passenger door on the driver’s side creating a second less pronounced one.

I brought this to the attention of the hotel’s front office manager who took photos and started a conversation with the property’s outsourced parking provider. He offered 10000 points or waived parking charges. I took the points.

The manager who promised the points to me assured that this tranche of 10000 wouldn’t get confused with the 10000 I was offered at the start of the stay. I bet him he was wrong but he promised that 20000 bonus points would post with my stay for sure.

When points posted for my stay the 20000 points weren’t there. Neither were 10000. Nothing came through. The hotel didn’t push back when I emailed to follow up however.

Between the points for the stay Hyatt’s current promotion American Airlines mileage-earning (and promotional bonus) these points and the free category 1-4 night I earned by hitting a new brand (Hyatt awards a free night after 5 10 and 15 brands stayed at) I came out way ahead on the stay. I’m still waiting to learn whether Hertz is interested in pursuing the dents but I’ve started a conversation with Chase’s insurance provider for primary collision coverage as well.

I didn’t have a fantastic stay at the property. I am not longing to return. But I’d absolutely stay here again – for instance this would be my go-to pick if I had a meeting at the Department of Transportation or for a leisure stay if I were going to a Nationals ballgame and wanted to use points I could rent a car no problem because the property’s $58 valet fee would be waived on an award stay as a Globalist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivQFodHRwczovL3RoZXNwb3J0c3J1c2guY29tL25iYS1uZXdzLXlvdS1kb250LXdhbnQtdG8tc2VlLXVzLW5leHQteWVhci1zdGVwaC1jdXJyeS1oaW50cy10b3dhcmRzLWEtcmV2ZW5nZS1zZWFzb24tY29taW5nLW5leHQteWVhci1mb2xsb3dpbmctZGlzYXBwb2ludGluZy1sb3NzLXRvLWphLW1vcmFudC1hbmQtdGhlLWdyaXp6bGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""You don't want to see us next year"": Steph Curry hints towards a revenge season coming next year following ...","Stephen Curry issues an ominous warning to the NBA about how dangerous the Golden State Warriors will be next season

The Golden State Warriors’ season has finally come to a bit of a disappointing end. The loss against the Lakers was understandable and even expected. However Stephen Curry and the team were expected to beat Memphis to snatch the 8th seed ahead of the NBA playoffs.

Unfortunately for the team while their offense wasn’t bad for most of the game the team’s defense broke down in key moments. Nerves were shown and confusion abounded within the roster which eventually culminated in a 117-112 defeat in overtime.

After the game Curry was understandably distraught. However instead of focusing on the negatives he looked straight at the camera and delivered a very scary message to the rest of the NBA.

“You don’t want to see us next year”: Stephen Curry believes that the Golden State Warriors will be a scary team next season

With this season done and dusted for the Warriors fans of the franchise are now looking forward to what’s next. And we must say the immediate future is looking very encouraging at the moment. And Stephen Curry is no different it seems. Here is what he had to say in his post-game interview.

“You talk about what we didn’t have what we lacked. But we did have a lot of heart… Just didn’t go our way… (We will) come back bottle this up everybody make the right strides take advantage of the summer. You don’t want to see us next year.”

At first many may scoff a bit at Curry’s statement. However when you look at what the Warriors have in store for next season you start to realize that the Chef could be scarily right.

The team will potentially have 2 lottery picks in a draft that is expected to be one of the strongest drafts in NBA history. Additionally as it stands Klay Thompson is closing in on being fully healthy and will likely return next season.

And to put the cherry on top the experience the younger players have now is massive. The fact that they were competitive against the Lakers in a scenario similar to the playoffs is huge. It speaks to how much the team has grown in such a short amount of time.

You accumulate all that and you indeed have a frightening team. And as Steph said teams will probably not want to see this franchise in the NBA playoffs next season.

""I believe in Israel both as a capitalist and as a Zionist."" Blumberg has been investing in Israel since the 1980s he is a “traditional” Jew (Masorati) who speaks Hebrew (but prefers to be interviewed in English) and speaks enthusiastically about the local economy - he is filled with emotion when it comes to the Israeli high-tech scene (and not just about that).

Find the companies before they become companies

Blumberg named his fund after himself - Blumberg Capital something not many in the business do but that is not the only thing separating Blumberg from the rest. He specializes in investing in startups at very early stages seed and A rounds. In the current climate of massive fundraisings and growing numbers of unicorns Blumberg has seemingly been pushed aside. However it does not seem to bother him he knows what fortune his early investments can bring.

Over the years he has made notable gains most recently it was thanks to the New York IPO of DoubleVerify a startup for ads monitoring valued at $4.2 billion. Blumberg led his fund's first investment in DoubleVerify which started in Israel back in 2009 and following the IPO last month Blumberg Capital’s share soared to almost $700 million. Blumberg also had similar success with Check Point EFI Cyveraת which was purchased by Palo Alto and Zooz bought by PayU.

Blumberg’s ties with Check Point and Palo Alto can provide insight on how the veteran investor operates utilizing his long-standing relationships with Gil Shwed CheckPoint’s founder and Nir Zuk one of its first employees and later the founder of Palo Alto. Blumberg (62) has been a known investor in the Israeli ecosystem for decades and was an early investor in Check Point back in the 90s. Tales of how he forced Shwed to meet with potential clients and how he functioned as the company’s de facto business development VP and not just as an investor have been told and retold for years.

Back then no one would have guessed that Shwed and Zuk will each lead a major cyber company worth over $10 billion but much of their early experience they gained with and thanks to Blumberg. “They are both geniuses” he says diplomatically during a video call from his home in Miami. “That is what makes Israel so special the fact both Gil Shwed and Nir Zuk were born in the same small country.” Blumberg also has a close relationship with Uri Levine one of the founders of Waze investing in Levine’s FeeX and FairFly.

If Blumberg arrived at Check Point during the company’s early days today his fund aims to grow companies even before they become a company. The fund’s operation in Israel is led by Yodfat Harel Buchris and Ido Novic (former top officer in the same unit) aiming to spot entrepreneurs at a very early stage. “We grab them right out of the army” Blumberg explains. “They might not even have a clear idea yet sometimes they just have a few lines of code and no team but we help them with forming an idea and a team. We have special relations with the IDF’s top intelligence units. We also brought in Sharona Mizrachi former Head of Human Resources at 8200. She knows the soldiers and their commanders she knows what they did and who wants to become a CEO in New York. So every day we move towards earlier stages of investments.”

Blumberg’s current fund his fifth amounts to about $200 million with about 30%-40% of the portfolio being Israeli companies. To date the fund invested more than half a billion dollars in more than a hundred Israeli companies. These days the fund invests in about 30 local ventures including unicorns such as Fundbox and Yotpo alongside smaller operations like Namogoo and Theator. Investments that according to Blumberg are planned to continue even if bleak predictions of a bursting high-tech bubble come to fruition. ""We will invest when value levels are high but also if the markets fall and even if there are wars here” he promises (the interview was conducted before the current escalation). ""We might look to cut costs choose to invest in options instead of stocks fly less and do more virtual meetings but we will always invest in Israel.""

""People are looking at the stock markets and say 'there's too much enthusiasm here.' I use a water sports analogy the Wall Street banks the investment funds even the economic media are all windsurfers meaning they look at the current wave at the wind at everything that is on the surface. We are not surfers we are divers working slowly carefully looking for interesting fish not concerning ourselves with what is happening above water.”

“No. If you look at it most of the big companies launched or soared during periods of recession for example Google’s growth after 2000 and Facebook’s after 2008. Obviously it's a tragedy when people lose their jobs but economic cycles are unavoidable. So it's better to put things on autopilot and have faith in Milton Friedman's notion of permanent income that supports growth. We can not assume we can run the global economy we have to be humble. That is why I enjoy lightning and thunder it reminds everyone how small they are.""

“The only thing slowing innovation down is regulation”

My conversation with Blumberg a rare interview with Israeli media is taking place during a hectic period for the local tech industry and through the sector as a whole. The huge sums of money being injected into young companies are changing the game startups try and grow at a faster pace they are hungry for talent and the high demand raises the costs of human resources which means they need more capital at earlier stages.

If in the past Blumberg could have invested only a few hundred thousand dollars in a company today’s investments cost a few million at least. It is the new normal. For example Insight Partners can invest $100 million in Assaf Rappaport’s Wiz a 1-year-old company without flinching or a huge fund such as Tiger Global Management which was known to only invest in established unicorns or very large sums of money in the past is suddenly interested in seed funding.

Perhaps this is the reason for Blumberg’s interview after making his name as a top early investor suddenly his field is overrun by new actors with very deep pockets. He is one of the first venture capitalists in Israel however his edge - his experience and his focus on early investing - is eroding thanks to big money and an influx of foreign funds.

""Nowadays it is much cheaper and easier to be a startup in the early stages"" Blumberg insists. ""First of all operating costs are lower because everything is kept on the cloud while the SaaS model (software as a service renting software for a monthly fee) reduces sales friction and makes it easier for startups with their sales. The model makes it easier for organizations to use small business’ products without having to buy expensive software packages from large companies. All it takes is a $15 credit card charge. It is a revolution that lowers barriers for startups.""

These are not the only changes Blumberg has seen during his long career. Investing in Israeli companies used to be “cheaper” relatively than investing in American companies which has made startups here more attractive however this ""discount"" seems to have disappeared these days. But Blumberg is convinced that it won’t hurt the market here. ""Is the current valuation of Israeli companies a cause for concern? Yes. But is Israel still attractive? Yes definitely.""

“Because of geniuses like Shwed and Zuk who grew here because of the military and because of the Jewish mind.”

""Judaism unlike many other religions is based on a perception of constant progress and constant dissatisfaction which leads to innovation. Jews were never willing for anyone to sacrifice them on any altar. When Shimon Peres once visited my synagogue in San Francisco he told me 'we are the world champions in dissatisfaction we are never satisfied with what exists.’ That is true and that is why we innovate so much the only thing slowing innovation down is regulation.”

Blumberg hates regulation and we will get to that a little later. But aside from that Blumberg says he would also like to see a change in attitude from the local tech sector speaking mostly about one of the industry’s growing challenges the soaring costs of talent. ""Startups compete with each other and especially with international giants that come to Israel. I remember a few years ago a senior official from one of the largest defense companies in the U.S. consulted with me and said ‘'we would like to enter Israel and recruit 7000 engineers.' I told him ‘it’s impossible you will break the market.'""

However when summing up the recruitment plans of large companies in Israel in the coming year the total reaches several thousand. Intel alone recently announced the recruitment of 1400 employees most of them engineers. So how do you prevent the market from breaking down? Blumberg offers a solution.

""Israel needs to further develop its outsourcing. The country is perfectly located in terms of its time zone and it can work relatively comfortably with most countries in the world from the east through Lithuania Poland and Ukraine to the U.S. in the west. There is no need to worry about losing your relative advantage because you will always prefer to own a company rather than be its employee. Furthermore when viewing an entire economy from above it is better for company ownership to remain within a country while employees can reside anywhere in the world. Israeli companies should spread like multinational companies from the U.S. or Germany. Not every high-tech worker should work from within Israel this is an old mentality of 'build and be built‘"" that last part he says in Hebrew. “Today even the Volcani Center understands that it is better to sell the seeds and not grow the tomatoes.""

""Israel should aspire to be like Hong Kong or Switzerland be the center of technology like they are the centers of trade and finance. The technological revolution is only beginning.""

Even so Israel is a technology-oriented economy. When I remind Blumberg that some say that the Israeli economy is an option on the Nasdaq and when it rises it flourishes he erupts with laughter ""I think I came up with that 40 years ago.”

“After I graduated” Blumberg has a Bachelor’s degree in Government from Harvard and an MBA from Stanford “I knew I would do something with Israel I even considered moving there and making aliyah. Then my first job was at T. Rowe Price an investment company which perhaps was the first growth fund and was among other things a major investor in Xerox and IBM. They sent me to Israel in 1981 to find out what the situation was but they made it clear that they would not want to invest in a socialist country with high inflation and where there are always wars. When I returned I told them everything they thought is true but also that these things are already included in the price of shares so the fact that we do not buy shares of companies such as Scitex or Elscint which behave like Nasdaq is our loss.”

""Later in the 80s I was the Bronfman family’s representative in Israel. They then owned Shufersal (Israeli supermarket chain) and some real estate and in 1989 I was sent to find additional investments. When I returned I told them ‘my analysis is that the entire Israeli market trades at a multiplier of six on profit’ meaning it will return the investment relatively quickly compared to investments in the U.S. where the multipliers were higher so you should buy the entire Tel-Aviv stock market.’”

Escaping Silicon Valley

Blumberg grew up in Fresno California “typical middle-class family” he says. ""We were Jews I went to the synagogue on Saturdays and to Sunday school but we did not know anything we did not celebrate any holidays. And yet I was the weird kid who loved Judaism the one who asks his grandparents about their life in Eastern Europe. The Rabbi at Sunday school told us about the Israeli pioneers who were drying up swamps and I fell in love with it. Life in California seemed a bit boring to me I thought ‘is that all there is? malls and ski trips?’ So I joined a Jewish study group but I saw it less as religion and more as history and culture.”

When he was young he says he knew that he would work with Israel and he had much curiosity about what was going on in the country. After high school Blumberg spent an entire summer here hence his Hebrew and since then he has made sure to visit every year. He follows Israel closely not only in business but also in politics. Throughout our conversation he mentions the Likud Israel’s ruling party and “Ha-Marach” Israel’s Labor party’s old name.

He says that to this day he observes Judaism makes sure to go to synagogue and does not miss an opportunity to discuss Israel often with the enthusiasm that could be attributed to those who love it from afar but do not reside in it. ""Every morning I get up and say ‘modeh ani’” which means in Hebrew I give thanks. “I thank that there are in the world in general and in Israel in particular more and more ideas companies and people who want to invest in growth. Or as a French friend once told me ‘Jews are like yeast they make the whole world rise like bread.’”

Blumberg has been openly gay since coming out when he was 30 however he is very protective of his privacy even avoiding social events with colleagues. He lives with his partner and their two sons aged 12 (They are planning his Bar Mitzvah in Jerusalem this summer) and 10. He is also a hawkish Republican and ardent supporter of former President Donald Trump. According to reports he donated more than $100000 to Trump’s campaign during the last elections.

Blumberg likes Trump because he also does not like taxes. When we discuss President Biden's plan to extend taxation over capital gains on the very wealthy and raise corporate tax the gaiety that characterized Blumberg throughout the conversation fads. ""Taxes should scare everyone"" he says gravely. ""This spirit characterizes not only the U.S. but the entire world and it's a shame because throughout history it's easy to see that countries with low corporate tax rates perform better.""

In general Blumberg advocates for minimal intervention in markets ""governments tend to act too much and the problem is that they try to solve problems linearly and do not know how to cope with non-linear problems. The massive flow of money by central banks in the past year is also a terrible economic mistake. Money has become too easy and there is too much capital available.""

Taxation was one of the reasons that led Blumberg to move from San Francisco to Florida and he was not alone. There is an ongoing discussion in the U.S. about a so-called ""exodus"" from traditional centers of influence especially California. First there was the tech crowd who left expensive San Francisco including big names such as Elon Musk who moved to Texas and Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois ​​of PayPal who moved to Miami. Even companies such as Oracle and HP moved their headquarters to Houston. The second wave has financial entities leaving New York for Florida. It includes Goldman Sachs Blackstone (the world's largest investment fund) and the giant hedge fund Elliott which is planning to rent offices in Miami. Blumberg and his family's move to the east also made headlines.

""I had a very hard time leaving the Bay Area. My family has lived in California for four generations but life here is much better and more rewarding"" he explains. ""Taxes are lower education is better there is less crime the homeless are better treated and there aren’t any things like severe fires because everything is better managed. I have won enough in life so I do not have to escape California’s high living costs like others but I want to expand the fund to the evolving ecosystem in Florida."" The U.S. is already anticipating a new Silicon Valley in Miami which in recent years saw tremendous momentum in founding startups. Like many others Blumberg just wants to be a part of it.

When I ask if he happened to move to Florida also to be closer to former President Trump Blumberg laughs. But there are more than a few key figures who came out as Trump supporters and then moved away from “blue” California including Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois. Both gay both friends with Blumberg who previously admitted that identification with the Republicans hurt him. ""I do not think I have lost deals but I know I have lost some friends"" he said in an interview after Trump was elected president.

“The great Walter Wriston who used to head Citigroup once said that ‘capital goes where it's welcomed and stays where it is treated well so are talent and ideas’” Blumberg says. “That is why the financial sector and high-tech companies are moving to Florida. People have been leaving California in recent years because of poor governance especially when it comes to real estate. And I recognize that Israel is making the same mistakes.""

""Real estate prices in Israel are much higher than they should be because the government controls the land. Even with good intentions such as not wanting to alter the landscape or hoping to preserve agricultural land it is unclear why there should be kibbutzim near Tel Aviv for instance? I really like rural areas I grew up in such an area but at the end of the day it actually hurts the weak.""

""Technology does not raise prices. If demand rises supply must increase otherwise prices will go up. One of the fascinating studies in the field belongs to Tom Sowell of Stanford a student of Milton Friedman who should have received the Nobel Prize. He studied real estate prices from the 1960s to the last decade both in the Bay Area and in Houston. Both areas are similar in size and structure both have an educated population and thriving industries - in Houston oil and high-tech in the Bay. Houston gave a free hand to the real estate market beyond safety matters it did not restrict construction meanwhile in California there were many restrictions. The result is that in Houston real estate prices did not drastically rise while in California they quadrupled. And as mentioned it also hurts poor families.""

Politicians should learn to think like doctors

When Blumberg goes into criticism of governments or state conduct it's hard to stop him. The current stock market tide including excessive pricing of technology companies and the flourishing of SPACs (Special-purpose acquisition company referring to ""hollow"" inactive companies that raise initial capital on the stock market and then merge with companies with real activity mostly start-ups) is in his opinion a product of leadership mistakes.

“SPACs are the offspring of the Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank acts” he proclaims. Both acts named after the legislatures behind them forced hard regulations on Wall Street following the economic crises in 2000 and 2008. The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley act focused on business transparency while the 2010 Dodd-Frank act was meant to prevent the creation of too-big-to-fail financial institutions. Those objecting to the legislation claim it dangerously lowered the number of IPOs. “Those who are at fault for too much money being in the financial system are governments not SPACs” Blumberg says referring to both the regulations and the stimulus packages the U.S. Government gave its citizens and fueled the growing investments in the stock market.

Of course it was not just the citizens who have stepped up investments rather big funders. ""The fact that funds like Tiger Global Management deal with growth companies every other day is also a result of regulation which kept technology companies private for a longer period. In the past such funds would not even speak with us but today they are looking to step in much sooner. That is the market's response to over-regulation.""

Tiger Global manages $50 billion and is raising $10 billion more. It is an unheard-of sum and Tiger Global very much represents this past unprecedented year with big daily investments. The fund used to specialize in companies that are about to go public but today it seeks companies in much earlier stages. Tiger Global is not the only fund that changed its strategy and others are following into Blumberg’s old stomping ground flooding it with capital. Yes he is speaking here from a certain position and with the same passion that characterized him throughout the whole conversation fiercely defending his worldview that it must be only the fault of the government.

When I remind him that during the Trump era we did not really see the administration reducing regulations he replied: ""This is not a party issue at all. The great de-regulator in the United States was Jimmy Carter (Democrat) followed by Ronald Reagan (Republican). Kennedy also made moves in the field. The tendency is to see deregulation as dangerous when in practice it is far less dangerous than a slow trickle of additional costs. Politicians should learn to think like doctors and follow the Hippocratic oath - 'do no harm.’""",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2020 Take-Two Interactive confirmed it was working on 93 games. The company will start delivering on this slate throughout this year. Take-Two recently said it plans to release 62 games by the end of April 2024 leaving roughly 31 games for the post-2024 timeline. Not all of the 93 games will actually release and some will be cancelled but we don't know which ones are deeper 2024-beyond titles and which aren't.

Take-Two wants to launch 21 games in FY2022 (rom now until April 2022) including annualized sports games re-releases like the Grand Theft Auto V next-gen version on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S mobile games and a new IP from Gearbox.

Here's a breakdown:

The FY2023-24 period is where things get really interesting. The company says it plans to deliver sequential growth across these two years that exceed the record earnings made during the pandemic-surged FY2021 period. Take-Two made a record $3.5 billion in net bookings and over $2.2 billion from recurrent consumer spending.

There's two big reasons for the massive FY24 forecast: Take-Two will likely make more money simply because it will have a lot more games on the market including 20 free-to-play monetized mobile games but also because of the long-term engagement strategies that will be baked into all the games. This will include DLC post-launch content and in-game purchases especially in heavy-hitting annualized sports titles like NBA 2K.

The company is very confident in this pipeline and has made significant team expansions to meet the release goal. Take-Two has hired over 1500 developers in the last two years bringing total development headcount to over 5000 people.

""Looking ahead we expect to deliver over 40 titles over FY2023 and FY2024 gives us confidence in reaching new record levels of operating levels"" the company said in an earnings call.

During Take-Two Interactive's Q4 2021 earnings call (via Seeking Alpha) CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed that The Outer Worlds has sold-in more than 3 million units since it was released in October 2019. Later in the call Take-Two president Karl Slatoff answered a question about the Obsidian Entertainment-developed game stating that the company was not only excited about the future of The Outer Worlds but was happy to be a part of it.

""And we will be participating in the franchise and whatever the future holds for that franchise"" Slatoff said. ""So we feel really good about it. And we think that it's still building audience and this game itself has a lot of life left in it. And in the future -- we'll see what the future holds for it. But we do think it's a long-term franchise and it is certainly something that we're pleased with the results.""

Take-Two's comments on being involved in The Outer Worlds' future were of note mainly due to the fact that Microsoft purchased Obsidian in 2018 and Slatoff's comments made it seem as though it would retain publishing rights for new installments despite that.

Private Division cleared up the confusion in a statement to Gamasutra saying that while the company would still be supporting 2018's The Outer Worlds Obsidian and Microsoft would handle the publishing of future iterations.

""Private Division is still supporting and marketing The Outer Worlds including the upcoming release of Murder on Eridanos DLC on Nintendo Switch"" said the company. ""Moving forward Obsidian and Microsoft will be publishing future iterations in the franchise and we're absolutely thrilled to see where they take it.""

Lawson fund for Black and Indigenous students,"The late Gerald A. Lawson.

AP



USC Games has announced a new fund in honor of a Black engineer who transformed video games.

The fund received a significant contribution from Take-Two Interactive to kickstart the initiative.

The aim of the endowment is to support Black and Indigenous students in the gaming industry.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

USC Games at the University of Southern California ranked as North America's number one games undergraduate program in 2021 is paying homage to gaming trailblazer Gerald ""Jerry"" Lawson by establishing an academic endowment in his name.

Lawson was a Black engineer who led the design of one of the earliest game consoles.

The Gerald A. Lawson Endowment fund was set up to help Black and Indigenous students who wish to pursue undergraduate or graduate degrees in video game design and computer science. Another goal for the fund is to help increase minority representation in the gaming and tech industry Jim Huntley a USC Interactive Media and Games professor told Insider.

Take-Two Interactive a New York-based publisher and creator of games such as ""Grand Theft Auto V"" and ""Red Dead Redemption"" via its Rockstar Games label was among the contributors of the initial seed funding making a significant endowment to create the initiative.

""The reason why we've been championing the Lawson fund is because so much of today's finding job opportunities is about your social network and the people you interact with on a professional as well as a social basis. And a lot of those social connections are made during your undergraduate and graduate years in college"" said Huntley.

But if you're underrepresented at universities across the country because of the cost of college fees rising he added you won't have those connections that will get you on the inside track for job opportunities at gaming companies.

Bryant Young a USC student studying computer science echoed these thoughts. He told Insider: ""We are more than qualified but often the high price of tuition prevents people from going.""

When industries are not particularly diverse usually the conventional wisdom that follows is companies recruit as actively as they can in underrepresented communities. But it's very competitive because everyone is doing the same thing said CEO of Take-Two Interactive Strauss Zelnick. ""Our hearts are in the right place but the talent just isn't there and our view is – what do we need to do to make sure the talent is there?""

Take-Two Interactive has been involved in every part of the educational journey for students who wish to enter the gaming industry. Among many initiatives the company is involved in middle schools by supporting STEM programs especially for young girls. These programs include ""Girls Make Games'' and ""Games for Change.""

""Hopefully what we're doing is going to increase the universe of potential candidates and that universe will benefit our competitors as well as ourselves"" Zelnick said. ""This is not a particularly selfish exercise.""

""We know though that we don't want a zero-sum game we want to change the game to ensure diversity becomes commonplace"" he added.

Boka Agboje an undergraduate studying Interactive Entertainment at USC said he is encouraged by the USC Games Program taking this first step. ""We need to continue to support all efforts to tear down the barriers black and brown students face when working to enter the games industry.""







""One thing you hear in interviews across the games industry is the importance of a ""culture fit."" When for too long the ""culture"" in many studios has been developed primarily by white men candidates of color are placed at a quiet but pervasive disadvantage"" Agboje added.

Looking ahead Noah Lee an Interactive Media and Game Design student at USC said: ""I hope that students will be able to believe that by being granted the scholarship they are being encouraged to continue to pursue their education.""

Lawson the fund's namesake was a key innovator in the video gaming industry. Aside from his work on the Fairchild Channel F Console he also led the team that invented interchangeable ROM game cartridges per VentureBeat. A month before his passing in April 2011 Lawson was celebrated as an industry pioneer by the Interactive Game Developers Association.

His contributions are also on permanent display at the World Video Game Hall of Fame at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester New York.

Huntley who is striving for change said: ""We really need more industry partners to take the perspective of Take-Two of investing in the future that everybody wants to see which is more diversity more equity and inclusion from an industry perspective long-term.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZnJhbmtsaW5zLW1jbGFyZW4tdHVybmVkLWludG8tbGVnby1yYWNlci1iZWNvbWVzLXN1cGVyLWZhc3QtZ3RhLXYtZ2V0YXdheS1jYXItMTYxNzIzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Franklin's McLaren Turned Into LEGO Racer Becomes Super-Fast GTA V Getaway Car,"GTA V is still a super-popular game even so many years after its official launch and without a doubt partially responsible for the whole thing is the large collection of mods that keeps growing and growing.

Los Santos has therefore become a totally unpredictable city that can serve as the home of super-tall buildings with water slides on the roof  superheroes and obviously LEGO cars too.A video published on YouTube channel Hazardous shows how Franklin’s 2019 McLaren Senna is turned into a LEGO racer at the Los Santos Customs and while at the first glance this mod reminds of Forza  it’s still a pretty cool ride for the streets of GTA V as well.And as it turns out it’s also a good choice if you’re in search of a super-fast getaway car as the video shows that a LEGO-made 2019 McLaren Senna can help deal with four-star police chases without too much effort. As long as God mode is activated of course because otherwise it’s all just a matter of time until it becomes a huge pile of useless metal (or LEGO bricks) given the speed it reaches.But if running away from the cops isn’t necessarily your cup of tea and you’d rather enjoy doing some stunts this LEGO racer can do this too. It’s not easy that’s for sure but climbing on top of the tallest tower in GTA V is something totally doable for this custom car.At the end of the day these customizations are the living proof there’s a good reason why GTA V is still selling like hotcakes 8 years after the launch.Take-Two Interactive Rockstar’s parent company says it sold no less than 145 million copies of Grand Theft Auto Online since launch and without a doubt the continuously growing number of mods and add-ons together with the madness that 2020 has ended up becoming had a major contribution to this important achievement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy83OTUwMy9ndGEtbWFkZS1uZWFybHktMS1iaWxsaW9uLWluLXJldmVudWUtbGFzdC15ZWFyL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GTA V made nearly $1 billion in revenue last year,"Grand Theft Auto V is still a revenue monster that consistently delivers hundreds of million dollars every year from GTAO sales.

GTA V released over seven years ago but is still raking in hundreds of millions of dollars every year for Take-Two Interactive.

After years of big success Take-Two has expected GTA V to moderate in the long run. That hasn't actually happened yet. In fact seven years after release the game is still achieving record earnings highs. The game has now sold 145 million copies and GTA V makes up 42% of total franchise sales. Both GTA V and GTA Online helped Take-Two hit a record $3.37 billion in net revenues in FY2021. This trend may continue with the third console release of GTA V on PS5 Xbox Series X/S this November.

How much is the franchise earning every year? In a recent SEC filing Take-Two confirms that the GTA franchise generated 29.2% of total revenues for the year or $984.9 million. For comparison's sake Call of Duty earned over $3 billion in revenues last year.

GTA V/GTA Online increased its revenues by $267.4 million throughout this period thanks to pandemic spending surges high engagement and new content in GTA Online.

Despite a new next-gen re-release of Grand Theft Auto V in November and the promise of tons more online content Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick still expects the game's earnings to start slowing down."

Over 50 protesters have blockaded four McDonald’s (MCD) UK distribution centers and are calling for the world’s largest fast-food chain to become entirely plant-based by 2025.

Animal Rebellion is stopping workers from accessing four sites across England using trucks beacons and bamboo towers with people locked into concrete blocks at the base said the climate and animal justice movement Saturday.

“We believe that putting pressure on one of the largest and most iconic corporations in the world who are responsible for significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation can have an impact” a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion Alex Lockwood told CNN over the phone Saturday. The group is asking McDonald’s to transition to a plant-based food system to “stop the climate crisis and end the suffering of animals” it said in a statement.

The activists plan to blockade the distribution centers for at least 24 hours but will try to stay for 48 said Lockwood. The bamboo structures will be difficult for police and workers to remove because of the protesters locked into the base.

Animal Rebellion has parked trucks outside the centers with messages attached reading “Meat & Dairy = Climate Crisis” and “Plant-Based Food System.” The blockade will affect around 1300 restaurants and 3.5 million customers according to the activist group.

“We want to shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the sustainability measures of McDonald’s and how they claim to have science-backed emissions targets while ignoring how unrealistic they are when they continue to serve the menu they serve” said Harley McDonald-Eckersall a 23-year-old who volunteers full-time with Animal Rebellion. “We want to open up a conversation with them.”

McDonald-Eckersall began protesting at a McDonald’s distribution center at Hemel Hempstead a town northwest of London at 5 a.m. local time (midnight ET). Police arrived on the scene around three hours later McDonald-Eckersall told CNN but she added the atmosphere was “very relaxed.”

We’ve had really positive conversations with workers lots of them taking selfies with the clown car and big burger so that’s been enjoyable” she said. “People are open to hearing why we’re here.”

Animal Rebellion a sister group to the environmental movement Extinction Rebellion has not yet heard from McDonald’s McDonald-Eckersall said.

The American corporation said its distribution centers were facing disruption. “We are assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items” a McDonald’s spokesperson told CNN. “We apologise to our customers for any disappointment caused.”

The spokesperson declined to say whether McDonald’s would open a dialogue with Animal Rebellion.

McDonald’s expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 150 million tons by 2030 and co-founded the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef in 2011 which aims to improve the sustainability of the global beef supply chain.

Francesca DeBlase head of McDonald’s global supply chain wrote in a CNN opinion piece in September that reducing emissions has to be the food industry’s “number one priority.”

The F-150 Lightning was revealed on Tuesday during an event held by President Biden one day before it was scheduled to make its official debut.

The full-size four-door truck has the same body as Ford’s other F-150s but the Lightning is the most powerful of the lineup ever Fox News reported this week.

According to Fox the F-150 Lightning has dual inboard electric motors and will be available with two battery sizes delivering 230 miles and 300 miles of range.

The truck also has standard all-wheel drive and will cost only $39974 when it hits the market early next year FOX Business reported Wednesday.

When it does go on sale here are some of the other electric trucks it could be competing against.

Lordstown Motors’ Endurance pickup

The Endurance pickup from Lordstown Motors is made with four in-wheel hub electric motors that provide 600 horsepower and four-wheel-drive Fox News previously reported.

According to Fox the Endurance is expected to have a range of 250 miles per charge and will cost $52200 when it hits the market.

In March FOX Business reported that Lordstown Motors has more than 100000 pre-orders for the Endurance and that the automaker is expected to start making deliveries in September which could be ahead of competitors like Ford and Tesla.

Tesla’s Cybertruck

Tesla first debuted the electric Cybertruck in 2019 at a now-famous event where designer Franz von Holzhausen cracked the truck’s so-called ""armor glass"" windows with a metal ball.

Unlike the F-150 Lightning and the Endurance Tesla decided to design its electric truck with an unconventional style including an angular body and no conventional hood Fox News reported when the truck was first revealed.

According to Fox News the Cybertruck -- which will sell for $49900 -- has ""nearly identical performance specs to the extended range F-150 Lightning.""

However it is unclear when the Cybertruck will be ready for launch FOX Business reported last month.

Rivian is expected to be the first automaker to release its electric truck with production on the midsize R1T pickup expected to begin in June this year Fox News reported in November.

The R1T will initially cost $75000 and have all-wheel-drive a hands-free highway driving aid and a range of 300 miles per charge.

GMC's Hummer EV

The Hummer name is returning on a premium off-road electric pickup that's scheduled to hit showrooms late this year at a starting price of $112495.

The tri-motor truck will be able to accelerate to 60 mph and go 350 miles per charge thanks to the largest battery pack ever installed on a retail electric vehicle which will push its weight above 9000 pounds.

The Hummer EV will be equipped with a unique feature called Crab Walk Mode that allows it to steer all four wheels in the same direction and move diagonally.

A 3-year study has found that Tesla occupies 74% of the electric vehicle market in the United States. Over the past three years the study counted 568881 EVs sold in the US accounting for 97% of the entire EV market in the country. Tesla sold 430592 electric vehicles in the same period.

The study revealed that the Tesla Model 3 made up about 51% of the average EV market share with 296392 sedans sold over the past three years. The Tesla Model 3 is the country’s best-selling electric vehicle according to the study.

Following the Model 3 in second and third place are the Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X respectively. Over the past three years the study calculated that Tesla sold 67335 Model S sedans making up 12% of the EV market in the United States. The EV manufacturer sold about 67225 taking up another 12% of the EV market in the US.

Coming in fourth place with 57629 vehicles sold is the Chevy Bolt which made up 10% of the EV market in the US for the past three years. Following the Bolt is the Nissan Leaf with a 7% market share and 38310 vehicles sold. The rest of the EVs that made up the top ten vehicles in the US EV market include the BMW i3 VW e-Golf Fiat 500E Audi e-Tron and the Kia Soul EV.

In the last TSLA earnings call Elon Musk stated that the Tesla Model 3 became the best-selling luxury sedan in the first quarter of this year. He also announced Tesla’s goal to make the Tesla Model Y the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world by either 2022 or 2023.

Tesla seems to be on track with its Model Y goals. Based on a small study by Car and Driver Tesla Model Y sales have already started to overtake Model 3 sales in California. Musk mentioned in the past the Model Y sales would eventually overtake the Model 3 Model S and Model X combined. Based on the study Musk’s predictions seem to be on point.

Or follow us on Google News

In a recent run at Laguna Seca The Kilowatts spotted a neat feature on a Tesla Model S Plaid: a new active spoiler that’s enormous (compared to factory active spoilers we’ve seen before).

One big thing we can learn from this is that Tesla is working on not only having its cake but eating it too. Tesla has reached the edge of what track performance they can get out of the Model S without sacrificing range and now they’re going to keep going.

The Challenge Here: Downforce vs. Drag

I could go into depth about all of the math and science involved but a recent “Engineering Explained” video goes through most of it. In his example he’s looking at different variants of the same Porsche model but the aerodynamic engineering principles are basically the same. Have a watch:

The big problem in engineering performance EVs is that you get to the point where you need more downforce or aerodynamic pressure that pushes the car into the ground to help the tires get a better bite on the pavement. At high speeds this is essential because the car will eventually start to come off the ground and lose grip entirely. Big spoilers and other big aerodynamic features can accomplish this but they come at a cost.

When you optimize for downforce you end up increasing overall drag. For a race car that’s usually okay because you’re better off to use more fuel and even lose some top speed ability than you are to fly off the track. A tradeoff that avoids catastrophe is a no-brainer.

For a traditional Porsche this isn’t as big of a deal because a track-oriented car that people drive on the street still runs on gasoline. If it goes 20–50 less miles on a tank people can just stop for 5 minutes and pump in more gas. So they produce more mild versions that are set up for better efficiency and other versions of the same vehicle that are designed to add more downforce. Both versions will sell well and nobody is going to get mad about the downside of the performance version.

Where this becomes really problematic is when you’re building an electric vehicle for the street that needs to be more wild on the track. If you bolt on a big spoiler a big splitter and all of the other big things you need to get maximum track performance the vehicle’s range will suffer immensely. Losing 50 miles of range means you’re spending a lot more time at Supercharger stations on highway trips so the car loses a lot of the practical advantages (among other issues like losing range on the track increased battery heating etc.).

For most people that’s not a tradeoff they’re willing to make so Tesla has been optimizing for range.

As you can see the Model 3 (like most other Tesla vehicles) is smooth enclosed and set up for maximum range short of doing something more wild like the Aptera. For nearly all drivers this is the best thing to do.

Things Tesla Is Already Doing For the Model S

For the Model S they’ve made a number of other design choices to minimize drag and maximize range while getting some high speed downforce too.

As you can see the front “chin” of the car has a small splitter/spoiler. When a modest splitter is put on a car it can help front downforce a bit while actually improving drag. It could probably be a bit bigger (as Unplugged Performance’s bigger splitter for the Model 3 nets a 6% improvement) but making it any bigger would be too much for some people and possibly end up getting scratched up on the fronts of parking spaces. For example the Dodge Challenger’s bigger splitter has the odd trend of people leaving the splitter guards (originally intended for transport) on the car all the time.

The back of the S also has a mild diffuser. This not only helps with high speed stability but doesn’t carry much of a drag penalty. In some cases it can even help reduce drag. Once again Tesla struck a balance here in favor of range.

If you look just ahead of each wheel well you’ll notice what looks like a small backwards mud flap. When the air is coming at the front of the tires these help direct the air down and around the tire reducing drag. This may create a small amount of lift but the increased range is probably worth that tiny amount of lift (if any).

Obviously Tesla puts a lot of thought into vehicle aerodynamics and the designers and engineers are doing everything they can do to get the most performance without hurting range and efficiency. They’ve pushed that balance to the limit of what a passive and fixed body shape can accomplish and now they’re taking the next step out beyond those limits.

How Tesla’s Big Adjustable Wing Solves The Range vs. Drag Dilemma

When you take a car like the one Tesla had on the track for a drive on the highway you’ll probably want maximum range. In that case the spoiler will retract and put itself into the lowest position and your Model S will look like any other Model S. Airflow will be optimized for range and efficiency and you won’t get any kind of a noticeable drag penalty for having that spoiler. Life is good.

Stomp the skinny pedal and start getting into some serious speed and the spoiler can pop itself up to start adding the needed downforce. Obviously range will suffer but if you cared about range you wouldn’t be stomping that skinny pedal and running into triple-digit speeds right?

On the track similar benefits can be had. During high-speed turns the wing can pop up to add needed downforce. Same for high-speed runs in the straights if it’s needed for vehicle stability. In situations where the extra downforce is not needed the wing can tuck itself back into lines of the body of the car and allow for minimum drag.

Knowing Tesla’s past on things like this it probably has some neural net that can help decide whether to deploy the wing and at what angle to set it for maximum benefit.

Speaking of benefits this ability to choose whether the car has a wing or not is helpful for other things. By putting it away or into a lower drag position when it’s not needed Tesla can get the good from it without contributing to less track range and more motor/battery heating.

Tesla Model S Plaid drivers really can have their cake and eat it too!

If you're lucky enough to get your hands on the new TI-84 Plus CE Python Graphing Calculator from Texas Instruments you now have the opportunity to tinker with CircuitPython! That’s right it’s not just for the Raspberry Pi Pico and other microcontrollers.

In a recent blog post  Adafruit confirmed the news is official and CircuitPython is definitely coming with the new calculator. This confirmation was echoed by Texas Instruments in a follow-up Tweet .

The new development is referred to as TI-Python and it's based on CircuitPython. It functions as an interpreter for Python scripts that according to Texas Instruments run independently from the CE OS calculations.

Adafruit dug a little deeper and discovered a few modules that come with the new TI-Python application and verified seven ranging from random number generators to ones that integrate directly with the CE OS.

The TI-84 Plus CE Python Graphing Calculator is listed available for sale in the UK but has yet to make its way to the US—although Adafruit managed to find a teacher with one on Twitter . In the meantime interested parties can sign up for update notifications.

Most people in financial services get that. They don’t like it. But they had to reduce fees or die.

Reluctantly they have “gone with the flow.” They have reduced the cost of investing. That change has been one of the nice things about this century.

Advertisement

Investors have moved money from mutual funds with sales loads and high annual expense ratios to genuine no-load mutual funds with lower annual costs.

After that a lot of people moved money from still-costly managed funds to low-cost index funds. It’s a practice I have been recommending in this column since late 1991 — nearly 30 years.

If you work for a company that does its due diligence you’ve benefited from lower costs without needing to do any work. Your company 401(k) plan has shifted to lower-cost mutual funds. Some like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. have moved to index funds.

Advertisement

But some people haven’t had a choice. They are corralled in high-cost investment plans.

Worse many live right here in Texas. They are teachers and other public sector workers who are eligible to participate in 403(b) plans. These plans are the nonprofit and public sector equivalent of 401(k) plans. We’re talking about thousands of people and billions of dollars.

Here’s a sample number. The Teacher Retirement System of Texas which includes our university systems as well as public school teachers has 1.6 million participants active and retired.

Advertisement

Compare that with the 72000 workers at Exxon Mobil or the 30000 employed worldwide by Texas Instruments. Workers at those two model companies can invest for less than 0.10% a year. And they pay no fees for exiting an investment.

Advertisement

Texas teachers in contrast face annual expenses that can now exceed 2.5%. They also face surrender charges of up to 10% if they want to leave an investment.

That’s the deal they face in 403(b) plans all over the state.

So the teachers responsible for preparing the next generation for life and work are saddled with investment expenses from the last century.

Skeptics need only check some financial services industry figures. A recent report from the Investment Company Institute makes these observations:

Equity mutual fund expenses fell from an average of 1.04% in 1996 to 0.50% in 2020. Average bond fund expenses were cut in half too falling from 0.84% to 0.42%.

While only 46% of mutual fund sales were for no-load funds without 12b-1 fees in 2000 the figure nearly doubled to 88% by 2020.

Whether the money went to actively managed funds or index funds the bulk of the money went into funds whose expenses were in the lowest 25% of all similar funds. That’s clear evidence that money goes where it is treated well.

If it can.

Similar evidence comes from comparing two editions of The 401k Averages Book an invaluable benchmarking tool for employers who want to evaluate plans. The 2003 edition shows that total costs for a plan with 1000 employees averaged 1.17%. The current edition shows that average costs have fallen to 0.75%.

Advertisement

Joe Valletta editor and publisher of the book told me: “I give credit to fee disclosures for bringing down costs. It made plan sponsors aware of costs. Now many sponsors evaluate their plans every year.

“There are great opportunities for continued savings” he said.

The book also makes something else clear: Size matters.

Companies with fewer employees and less in assets to manage face higher costs than companies with many employees and lots of assets. While a company with 100 participants and $1 million in assets has typical costs averaging 1.86% a firm with 1000 employees and assets of $100 million has average costs of 0.75%.

Advertisement

Texas teachers and other public sector employees however are sold their 403(b) plan participation as individuals. That means they miss the readily available opportunities that come with size.

Here are just a few examples from the database of 403(b) investment expenses that were maintained by TRS until Texas legislators decided it wasn’t necessary to collect such information. (I downloaded the data from the TRS website when it was still available.)

Vanguard Wellington fund investor shares (ticker: VWELX) is offered by Vanguard with an annual expense ratio of 0.24%. It is priced at 1.50% in a variable annuity.

Vanguard 500 index admiral shares (ticker: VFIAX) is offered by Vanguard with an expense ratio of 0.04%. But teachers pay an annual 1.29% in another variable annuity. And the variable annuity has an 8% charge for exiting the fund.

American Century Equity Income (ticker: TWEIX) is offered by American Century with an expense ratio of 0.92%. But to get it through a Texas 403(b) plan will set you back 2.24% in a variable annuity.

Fidelity Contrafund (ticker: FCNTX) is offered by Fidelity with an expense ratio of 0.86%. But 403(b) plan participants face an annual expense charge of 1.9% in a variable annuity. They also face a maximum 7% charge for exiting the fund.

There is absolutely no reason for this to continue. We only need to bring Texas into the same century as 401(k) plans and IRAs. It could be done by an observant and thoughtful Texas Legislature.",,,,,,,,,

The rally was organized by Rhode Island for Palestine a coalition of Rhode Islanders supporting the Palestinian struggle for freedom justice and equality.

“At least 200 people in Gaza including 60+ children have been killed by Israeli air strikes funded by $3.8 billion in annual United States aid. The assault will continue now and into the future until United States aid ends. It is time to end our country’s role in Israeli apartheid and demand equality and the right of return for the Palestinian people” said the coalition in a statement.

The rally began at Burnside Park before marching to the headquarters of Textron which manufactures and profits from weapons sold to Israel. From Textron the protest moved towards the offices of Senator Jack Reed (Democrat Rhode Island) where a 200+ person “die-in” was staged. (200 sadly being the approximate number of Palestinians killed during the recent violence.)

Despite the recent ceasefire between Israel and Palestine the underlying issues that have sparked the recent violence remain unresolved. Rhode Island for Palestine is calling on Rhode Island’s congressional delegation to take action to end military aid and arms sales to Israeli. As coalition member BLM RI PAC said in a statement “Senator Jack Reed is on the Senate Armed Services committee and has an outsize influence on the National Defense Authorization Act. Representative David Cicilline is on House Foreign Affairs which has the power to block arms sales to Israel—in fact there is currently a resolution to block one such sale of $735 million in bombs to Israel. We urge our representatives to hear the voices of Palestinian Rhode Islanders and all Rhode Islanders who support justice in Rhode Island and across the world.”

Tractor Supply President and CEO Hal Lawton surprised Miranda with the donation during her exclusive performance for the retailer’s Neighbor’s Club members. The funds will be used to support the organization in its ongoing work to help shelter pets across the country.

“This is the most amazing surprise” said Miranda when presented with the check by Lawton. “Tractor Supply’s dedication to the welfare of animals has always been something I admired even before our partnership began – it’s such an important and authentic part of who they are as a company and as individuals. And their generosity has exceeded anything I could have imagined. I’m so grateful for the support and excited about all the good we’re doing together!”

Tractor Supply has worked with MuttNation since 2019 and is the exclusive home to its lineup of pet toys and supplies and the MuttNation On The Farm pet food and treats. A percentage of all sales goes back to the foundation to further support its cause.

""At Tractor Supply pets are part of our families. They're an integral part of the Life Out Here that we serve and we continuously seek out opportunities to support pet shelters and adoptions"" Lawton said. ""All of us at Tractor Supply are inspired by and grateful for Miranda's passionate commitment to protecting and supporting shelter pets. This donation is our way of thanking Miranda Bev and everyone at MuttNation for their partnership and for the work they continue to do for our four-legged furry family members.”

Lawton presented Miranda with the check as she performed with her friends Jack Ingram and Jon Randall in a virtual concert experience exclusively for members of Tractor Supply’s Neighbor’s Club loyalty program. The trio performed songs from their new album The Marfa Tapes as well as some of Miranda’s greatest hits at Green’s Grocery in Historic Leiper’s Fork near Franklin Tenn. The virtual concert is the first of many new perks available to Neighbor’s Club members through the redesigned loyalty program.

In March 2021 Tractor Supply partnered with MuttNation as the title sponsor of its signature Mutts Across America program that awards surprise grants to one shelter or foster-based animal rescue in every state. This year each of the 50 shelters received a check for $5000 for a grand total of $250000 making it the largest donation to date. Since the program’s launch in 2014 Mutts Across America has supported 350 shelters with over $1 million in grants.

The Minnesota-based Runnings retail chain which specializes in outdoor sporting apparel home improvement garden and tools pet supplies and farm-related goods opened a location in Vermillion purportedly its furthest south in January 2020. Runnings had taken over the old Campbell Supply a farm goods retailer.

The Campbell Supply building on West Cherry Street was about 10000 square feet. Runnings store manager Brandon Baughman said it wasn't exactly roomy -- ""you could get one cart down the aisle maybe.""

So Runnings decided to build a new store. In May of last year the chain announced it had purchased 8.5 acres of land from the Vermillion Area Chamber & Development Company commonly referred to as the VCDC.

Construction on the new store at 715 Bower St. -- on the northwest edge of town across from the Walmart and a ways behind the Hy-Vee -- began in June. It opened in March.

""Now we've got all kinds of space -- it's just so much better"" Baughman said.

Although it's a college town and the Clay County seat and the only place in the county with an appreciable number of stores Vermillion has a limited retail trade -- for instance prior to Runnings the only retailers that sold apparel were Walmart a few thrift and consignment stores a couple smaller women's boutiques the Tractor Supply Co. and the University of South Dakota's branded clothing store.

So in some ways Vermillion was ripe for the picking for a new store.

""Vermillion does have a good amount of property that's available and so as retailers start looking at expansions I think that Vermillion will start seeing more opportunities"" said Nate Welch president and CEO of the VCDC.

There's one product line in particular that's done well Baughman said -- firearms hunting supplies and fishing supplies. ""That is something that is just not readily available in Union Clay Turner (counties) -- there is something in Yankton County -- but it's very scarce there's not much of that around here.""

""This was something that this whole town and area has just been looking forward to"" he added.

The Vermillion store is the 53rd in the chain which is still expanding and currently has around 56 locations. The chain has an especially heavy presence in Minnesota and South Dakota.

Despite its success in the Upper Midwest Runnings has only two stores in Siouxland -- the one in Vermillion and one in Rock Rapids Iowa. Sioux City-based Bomgaars which is in some respects similar to Runnings has a heavy presence throughout the Northwest Iowa trade region.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmliZGVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3Mvd2F0Y2gtdmlkZW8tZmlzaGluZy1ldmVudC1icmlnaHRlbnMtZGF5LWZvci1hcmJ1dHVzLXJlc2lkZW50cy9hcnRpY2xlXzc0MDA5MjJlLWJhN2QtMTFlYi1iYWViLWQzNDY0MGZiNWZhNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH VIDEO | Fishing event brightens day for Arbutus residents,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Stay up to date on how the novel coronavirus is impacting travelers and cardholders by bookmarking our dedicated COVID-19 hub page.

Many travelers are gravitating to road trips in the coming weeks and months as they look to venture out while staying closer to home and avoiding airports and airplanes.

AAA Travel expects a significant rebound in the number of Americans planning to travel this Memorial Day holiday weekend. From May 27 through May 31 more than 37 million people are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home an increase of 60% from last year when only 23 million traveled the lowest on record since AAA began recording in 2000. Despite this 2021 summer travel still represents 13%—or nearly 6 million—fewer travelers than in 2019.

Yet even as travelers flock to the nation's roadways many facilities may not be open. Rest stops and service stations are opening but it still may be a challenge to find a place to go when you need to well go.

Don't poo-poo the importance of apps that help you find ""magnificent facilities"" along your drive worthy of George Costanza — or products that can help you out in a pinch. And whether renting a car or braving the skies here's what you need to know about how even public restrooms haven't gone unaffected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Back to basics

Health and hygiene have never been a more popular topic of conversation. And all the old rules still apply.

""When using public restrooms consider using toilet paper on toilet handles to flush as they are notoriously contaminated with fecal bacterial"" says Dr. Hanh Le senior director of medical affairs at Healthline (also owned by TPG's parent company Red Ventures). ""Also always wash your hands well with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.""

""Toilet seat covers are also handy and provide an added sense of reassurance that you minimize contact with potentially contaminated surfaces but make sure to not touch the toilet seat cover after you've put it down.""

If there are disposable paper towels opt for those instead of hand dryers Le advised. ""Though hand dryers may feel like the best environmental solution studies have shown that the strong gusts created by hand dryers actually blow bacteria and viruses throughout the restroom environment thereby increasing everyone's risk of becoming exposed to fecal microorganisms"" she said.

Last but not least on the way out use the hand towels you used to dry your hands to open restroom doors so that you can exit said Le. ""Restroom toilet handles and door handles are typically found to be the most contaminated surfaces in public facilities.""

Keep in mind that SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — may be able to survive on surfaces for some period of time. According to Healthline the virus can last the longest on stainless steel and plastic (three to seven days) and paper and glass (up to four days).

How to find a bathroom

If you've decided to take a road trip or venture into your local area you may wonder about the availability of public restrooms. Well there's an app for that. Of course there is. Unfortunately these apps won't tell you about temporary closures so you may have to call ahead or take your chances.

Sit Or Squat

This app (iTunes and Google Play) was developed by Charmin (yes like the toilet paper) to help you find a public restroom near you wherever you may be in the world. With more than 100000 listings you can see bathrooms in the list or map view and filter locations for features such as accessibility or baby-changing tables. You can also rate bathrooms by cleanliness -- Sit indicates a clean bathroom while Squat indicates a bathroom with ah less-desirable conditions.

Bathroom Scout

With more than 1.8 million bathrooms listed worldwide this app (iTunes and Google Play) features public toilets as well as restrooms in restaurants and other facilities. It offers turn-by-turn directions to nearby bathrooms the ability to see a Google Street View of the location (if images are available) and you can rate the condition of the bathrooms. The paid version even includes sound cover when using a public restroom.

Flush

This free app (iTunes and Google Play) covers nearly 200000 restrooms worldwide. Search for restrooms by map and list view and get directions to ones nearby. You can also filter to see results for bathrooms that require a key or charge a fee. Best of all this app works even if you don't have an internet connection.

Have a backup plan

As the country reopens so have many public restrooms and rest stops.

But depending on your location you might discover your favorite facilities are still shuttered. Urban explorers in New York City and Washington D.C. for example often turn to Starbucks when in need of a bathroom. But Starbucks is no longer a place to linger and several locations in the Northeast still have signs announcing their bathrooms are closed. TPG's senior travel editor Melanie Lieberman suggests seeking out a Wawa as far north as New Jersey since many locations are open 24 hours a day and you can always pick up a soft pretzel on your way out.

TPG writer Chris Dong recently embarked on a road trip down I-95 to Virginia and noted that the rest stop bathrooms along the interstate were available.

If however you're in an area where open serviced bathrooms are still few and far between multiple TPG editors recommend turning to big-box home improvement stores or supermarkets for their facilities since they're considered essential and are consistently open. Wegmans Lowe's and The Home Depot in particular get high marks for open bathrooms that are often in tip-top shape.

What to pack

When you know you're going to be using public restrooms you need to pack for the worst-case scenario especially if you're venturing off the beaten path.

Bring hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes such as Clorox to-go wipes since they easily fit into purses glove boxes and diaper bags and kill 99.9% of germs. Other popular wipes include Purell or a pack of Germ-X wipes with moisturizing vitamin E. CareTouch makes alcohol-free fragrance-free wipes that are gentle enough for young children and have soothing vitamin E and aloe.

Because sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer can be in short supply and hard to find right now consider adding standard baby wipes and DIY hand sanitizer to your packing list if necessary. Other good items to have on hand are good old-fashioned paper towels gloves and toilet paper.

And what happens if you just can't find a place to go? Don't worry you can plan for that too. For families with little ones in tow pack a portable training seat such as the Kalencom Potette Plus. And for grown-ups there's a slew of solutions including funnels and feminine urinals to help on-the-go women.

Know before you go

If a flight might be in your summer travel plans there are changes to expect on your next trip through the airport and airplane bathroom too.

Airplane bathrooms

Many of the world's airlines implemented the International Air Transport Association (IATA) sanitation guidelines including cleaning lavatories once every two hours (or after being used 10 times) during flight. For high-risk flights (aircraft without HEPA filters flights originating from destinations with severe outbreaks and flights with a high passenger load among other factors) lavatories should be cleaned once an hour (or after being used five times) during flight.

IATA also recommends a deep cleaning at the end of a flight with an emphasis on lavatories and galleys. Surfaces should be cleaned with rags soaked with disinfectant with separate rags and mops for aisles lavatories and galleys.

At Southwest Airlines for example is using Sani-Cide EX3 a broad-spectrum disinfectant to clean commonly used areas including lavatories tray tables armrests seat belts flight attendant call buttons and overhead bin handles before every flight. Disinfecting wipes will be available on all flights for passengers.

United American and Air Canada are also among the airlines providing passengers with disinfecting wipes and Delta has told TPG it's electrostatically spraying and wiping down the lavatories along with the rest of the plane between every flight and then again overnight.

Airport bathrooms

Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX) has partnered with Flagship Aviation Services to ensure the cleanliness of 11 restrooms in Terminal 3 and 19 in Terminal 4. Approximately 300 cleaning crew are working 24 hours a day seven days a week to sanitize and disinfect the airport's highest touchpoints including bathrooms which are being cleaned multiple times each hour.

According to USA Today Los Angeles International (LAX) has issued a statement saying its coronavirus precautions include cleaning and disinfecting restrooms and public areas ""at least"" once an hour.

Other public bathrooms

It's impossible to know how clean restrooms are at public places such as hotels rest stops gas stations tourist attractions and even restaurants. But there are some areas in restrooms you might really want to avoid.

A 2019 study by BMC which has a portfolio of some 300 peer-reviewed journals found that hand-drying facilities in public washrooms can be reservoirs of drug-resistant bacteria. It's a finding that echoes Dr. Le's warnings. The study also found that washrooms in high- and middle-income areas generally had cleaner facilities and environments.

Bottom line

Unless you're one of those people who can hold it indefinitely you're probably going to need to use a public restroom if you travel this summer. And if you're traveling you'll want to know what bathrooms are available and what condition they're in.

One of the key things to keep in mind is that if a public restroom looks very dirty you should probably steer clear: It could be contaminated even if not with coronavirus.

""Desperate times require desperate measures obviously"" said Dr. Le ""but if you can mitigate your risks that's really how you'll best protect yourself.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmVtYWJsZW5kLmNvbS90ZWxldmlzaW9uLzI1Njc2NDIvaGJvcy10aGUtdGltZS10cmF2ZWxlcnMtd2lmZS10di1zaG93LXF1aWNrLXRoaW5ncy13ZS1rbm930gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Time Traveler's Wife TV Show: 9 Quick Things We Know About The HBO Series,"CinemaBlend participates in affiliate programs with various companies.

It's time to return to a timeless tale. Previously adapted for the screen in 2009 Audrey Niffenegger's celebrated debut novel The Time Traveler's Wife will soon be retold with an upcoming HBO series starring Rose Leslie and Theo James. Currently filming in New York City under showrunner Stephen Moffat (Doctor Who) details remain limited about this HBO adaptation but we do know some key facts about this in-development show which we'll share right now. Here's what we know about HBO's The Time Traveler's Wife.

The Time Traveler’s Wife Is Based On The Acclaimed Romantic Novel By Audrey Niffenegger

Published in 2003 Audrey Niffenegger's first novel The Time Traveler's Wife became a quick bestseller selling over 2.5 million copies in the U.S. Praised for its well-defined characters sharp prose and unique interpretation of time travel this literary debut found affection between both sci-fi lovers and romantics alike allowing it to secure broad appeal in no time. Serving as a metaphor for her failed relationships The Time Traveler's Wife was a love story that followed a man named Henry who time-traveled unpredictably and a smitten woman named Clare who must cope with his unorthodox condition. It was a tale that was — at once — boldly original and appropriately timeless.

You can purchase a copy of The Time Traveler's Wife on Amazon.

The HBO Series Will Star Rose Leslie And Theo James

For fantasy fans The Time Traveler's Wife isn't the first time that they've seen Rose Leslie and Theo James. Most notably the former is best known for playing Ygritte in Game of Thrones while the latter played Tobias ""Four"" Eaton in The Divergent Series. In this HBO series Leslie adopts the role of Clare Abshire and James will be seen as Henry DeTamble as we follow how their marriage is complicated due to time travel.

Elsewhere Rose Leslie is recognizable for her performances as Gwen Dawson in Downton Abbey and Maia Rindell in The Good Fight. Furthermore in film the actress starred in Honeymoon. Additionally Leslie appeared in The Last Witch Hunter Now Is Good Sticky Notes and Morgan. She's also attached to next year's Death on the Nile.

Meanwhile Theo James was seen in Underworld: Awakening and Blood Wars. The actor's other film credits include War on Everyone London Fields How It Ends The Inbetweeners Movie and The Benefactor. He also starred in Golden Boy and Sanditon. Additionally James was heard in Castlevania and The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.

The Time Traveler’s Wife Cast Includes Desmin Borges And Natasha Lopez

Along with Rose Leslie and Theo James playing our lovey-dovey lead characters The Time Traveler's Wife will also feature Desmin Borges and Natasha Lopez in supporting turns. Best known for playing Edgar Quintero in FXX's dark comedy series You're the Worst Borges has regularly bounced between film and television. His other notable TV credits include Living with Yourself The Good Wife Law & Order: SVU Switched at Birth Preacher and Madam Secretary. Most recently Borges had a starring role in Amazon Prime's short-lived sci-fi drama series Utopia. In film additionally the actor can be seen in Private Life Compliance Tower Heist Mr. Popper's Penguins The Mend and Cherry (2010). Next Borges recently shot a supporting role in Shotgun Wedding.

As for Natasha Lopez the actress is a relative newcomer. Her only other credits are Runner Runner and an episode of Law & Order: SVU. Certainly if this show does well this HBO adaptation could be her big break. But only time will tell there hardy har har.

The Time Traveler's Wife Is The Latest Series From Doctor Who And Sherlock’s Steven Moffat

Steven Moffat remains as hard-working as ever. Best known as the showrunner behind BBC One's Doctor Who and Sherlock as well as Netflix's Dracula and BBC 2's Coupling the veteran Scottish writer has kept an active profile over the past three-plus decades. Now Moffat tackles one of his most ambitious projects with HBO's The Time Traveler's Wife which is a huge honor for the celebrated scribe — by his own enthused admission.

Steven Moffat Says This TV Adaptation Is ‘About A Time Traveler' But It's Not Sci-Fi

As an earnestly emotional blend of romance and time-bending sci-fi it's easy to see why Steven Moffat found Audrey Niffenegger's novel to be such an appealing property. The showrunner has his fair share of experience with bleeding heart lovers and time-bending personalities so The Time Traveler's Wife has the potential to be a proper mending of two of his greatest interests. Certainly in the press release announcing this show Moffat was quick to flatter Niffenegger's ""extraordinary"" work hailing this TV adaptation as a ""dream project"" and detailing his affections. Here's what the writer said:

This is a story of loss but it’s not a tragedy. It's about a time traveler but it’s not science fiction. Despite Clare and Henry’s time scrambled relationship this is the tale of a grand ordinary love — but not necessarily in that order. This is a dream project for me. I have always loved Audrey Niffenegger’s extraordinary moving novel and it has inspired me many times so to be adapting it for television is the thrill of a lifetime. Working with David Nutter is a joy and an honour already and with Rose Leslie and Theo James as Clare and Henry and Natasha Lopez and Desmin Borges as Charisse and Gomez this is going to be the love story we need right now.

Steven Moffat Loved The Time Traveler's Wife So Much He Wrote A Doctor Who Episode As A 'Direct Response'

As we've noted earlier Steven Moffat is quite a fan of this source material. As he told Deadline Moffat was instantly spellbound by the time-bouncing text and he was compelled to write an episode of Doctor Who inspired by Audrey Niffenegger's book which became ""The Girl in the Fireplace."" He even went so far as to call it a ""direct response"" to the material. In a delightful turn of fate Moffat discovered that his own work was planted into Niffenegger's follow-up book. At that point Moffat realized that ""she was probably on to"" him. Now that he has a chance to adapt this meaningful material Moffat is ready to turn his dream into a reality particularly as he believes ""the brave new world of long-form television"" is ""ready for this kind of depth and complexity.""

The Upcoming Series Is Currently Filming In New York

There's no time like the present! While the upcoming adaptation took its sweet time in development (as we'll discuss in a moment) HBO's The Time Traveler's Wife is officially in production though its release date is unknown. It's also unclear how long production is expected to last — particularly given its recent start. That said we know that Emmy-winning director David Nutter (Game of Thrones) will helm all six episodes of Season 1.

Despite Its 2018 Announcement It Took Time Before Cameras Rolled On HBO's The Time Traveler's Wife

Ironically it took some time before cameras rolled on HBO's The Time Traveler's Wife. First announced in July 2018 as Deadline reported it took nearly three years since this initial announcement for the project to move forward. At the time it was a highly-sought property notably with Amazon vying to get it under their corporate umbrella. Following this news release we hadn't heard anything significant about the show's development; one could reasonably assume that it wasn't moving forward after all. Therefore it was a bit of a surprise when HBO revealed the show's production status.

The Best-Selling Novel Was Previously Adapted As A Movie In 2009 With Rachel McAdams And Eric Bana

If you're getting some deja vu about this upcoming series there's a good reason why. Prior to HBO's newest literary adaptation Audrey Niffenegger's novel inspired a 2009 movie starring Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams as our romantic leads who must come to terms with the former's irregular disorder which causes him to randomly time travel.

Directed by Robert Schwentke (RED) this weepy romantic drama suffered a number of delays and received mixed-to-negative reviews when it was released but the movie earned over $100 million worldwide and found its audience fittingly enough over time.

According to the investigative agency threat actors are using this spear phishing campaign to infect the victims with Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware.

A Bleeping Computer article mentions that according to the FBI threat actors have also designed a phishing campaign. In that malicious campaign they spoof this financial organization with registered domains email subjects and an application. This makes it look as if the emails came through the above-mentioned legitimate financial institution.

The Instance

In February 2021 a renewable energy company was targeted. In this attack the phishing emails asked the user to download a malicious Windows app that imitated the legitimate Truist Financial SecureBank App. The email faked the last step needed by the company to complete the process behind a $62 million loan.

The FBI added that the fraudulent loan amount was in line with the energy company’s business requirements. Further the FBI stated that the phishing email also contained a link for downloading the application a username and a password for access.

The phishing email appeared to have originated from a UK-based financial institution stating the Truist’s loan to the victim was confirmed and it can be accessed through an application that appeared to belong to the Trusit.

The malicious actors hosted this fake Windows app on a fraudulent domain registered that impersonated Truist.

Some other financial institutions like MayBank FNB America and Cumberland Private also seem to have been impersonated by this spear-phishing campaign.

It has been found that the malware gets deployed after users download and install the executable file in the spear phishing emails that they receive. It then connects them to secureportal(.)online domain.

The FBI has informed through their warning that attackers are using this malware to log keystrokes and take screenshots of the users’ screens.

It has been seen that this spear phishing campaign has also been successful in impersonating other financial institutions of the US and UK.

It is noteworthy that the attackers can use the login credentials of the user to access very sensitive information of the organization which can potentially harm their business interests. Moreover fake applications can be used to camouflage background malicious activities running in the background.

“Our purpose as artists is not to lift ourselves” Henderson said. “It is to lift up the art and thereby lift us all.”

Henderson a 1972 graduate of UNCSA’s School of Drama delivered the commencement speech at the university’s graduation ceremony at Truist Stadium in Winston-Salem. About 900 people attended the event at the site where the Winston-Salem Dash a minor league baseball team plays its home games.

Saturday’s event was the university’s first in-person graduation ceremony since 2019.

“There is a great civility to citizens gathering in museums concert halls opera houses and theaters” Henderson said. “Gathering not knowing what political or religious affiliation of the person standing or seated next to them might have — each experiencing creative expressions through their own personal lens to the same performance of fine art in the same moment.”

Henderson 71 a native of Kansas City Mo. said that people attending such events represent a combined audience who are amazed at the performers’ talents and skills.

“At a live performance joyous laughter and unexpected tears” unite an audience across all racial cultural and gender divisions among the audience members Henderson said.

The UNCSA graduates should accept their roles as “alchemists of empathy sorcerers of empathy and magicians of empathy” Henderson said. “Live performances are empathy clinics.”

You are the essential workers whose workplaces have been closed for a dangerous length of time” he said. “Our country needs your services.”

Henderson also spoke about his experiences as a UNCSA student and some of his achievements as a renowned character actor in plays television shows and films.

In April 2014 Henderson was part of the cast in the Broadway play “A Raisin in the Sun” that was being performed at a New York theater.

Henderson’s character appeared in the play’s second act he said.

Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama attended the performance and met the cast during the play’s intermission but Henderson hadn’t yet appeared on stage.

Henderson shook the president’s hand Henderson said. He then greeted Michelle Obama who knew the play and recognized Henderson’s character and asked him if he’d be on stage soon Henderson said. Michelle Obama then gave him a hug Henderson said.

He told the audience at graduation that he will never forget that moment.

Before his speech Chancellor Brian Cole presented Henderson with an honorary doctorate in fine arts from UNCSA.

During the ceremony the university awarded master’s degrees in fine arts bachelor’s degrees in fine arts and bachelor’s degrees in music. Members of the classes of 2020 and 2021 participated in the event.

A group of 519 students were eligible to receive degrees at Saturday’s event according to the university’s program. A university official called out the names of graduating students of both classes who didn’t attend the commencement.

Cole and other speakers praised the graduates for overcoming the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and earning their degrees.

“Commencement means more to you because of what you had to do get here” Cole said. “You have achieved so much. We are proud of you.”

After spring break in the 2019-20 school year the university conducted most of its classes virtually said Lauren Whitaker UNCSA spokeswoman. During the 2020-21 school year the university conducted most of its classes in-person.

After the commencement Isaac Balachandran who traveled from Bangalore India to study at UNCSA said that the only information he had about the arts conservatory came from an online article on the Hollywood Reporter website.

“It was very affordable” said Balachandran who received his bachelor’s degree in fine arts with a concentration in picture editing and sound design. “It was a roller coaster of fun.”

Jessica Rex of Greenville S.C. said she had a great experience during her three years at the university.

“I can’t believe it went that fast” said Rex who received a master’s degree in fine arts with a concentration in design and production. “I learned a lot.”

Notre Dame will be the favorite to win the ACC baseball tournament and it comes into Charlotte in solid form after weekend sweeps of North Carolina and Virginia Tech.

While the Irish are the top seed they are not untouchable. That was proven in Notre Dame's penultimate series of the regular season against Florida State.

Florida State took two games off the Irish at the start of May. NC State took Game 2 of their April series. The Wolfpack limited Notre Dame to five runs in Games 1 and 2.

Florida State and NC State have the benefit of playing in a postseason-like series prior to the ACC tournament.

The Wolfpack took the first two games by 6-4 scores and the two sides combined for over 20 runs in Saturday's finale.

NC State is one of the hottest teams in the conference a run that was aided by series against two squads in the bottom half of the ACC: the Wake Forest Demon Deacons and Pittsburgh Panthers.

Wolfpack outfielder Jonny Butler is one of the top individuals to watch in Charlotte. He began Saturday in the top 40 in batting average in Division I at .387.

NC State's Luca Tresh Jose Torres and Trevor McDonough are also worth watching. as they are all ranked as top 200 MLB draft prospects by MLB.com.

Notre Dame first baseman Niko Kavadas and the Florida State duo of Robby Martin and Matheu Nelson should be early round selections as well.

Louisville catcher Henry Davis and Miami outfielder Adrian Del Castillo are ranked in the top 25 of the latest prospect list.

Del Castillo and the Hurricanes could wreak the most havoc to Notre Dame's title bid since they come into Charlotte on a five-game winning streak in ACC play.

The Hurricanes held Louisville to three runs from Thursday to Saturday and received contributions from all around the lineup since Del Castillo failed to record a hit in the first two games.

Miami did not play Notre Dame in the regular season but it did go 2-1 in one of its cross-division series with NC State. Florida State swept the Hurricanes in March.

The Hurricanes were second in the Coastal Division behind the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets who secured the No. 2 seed with a Saturday win over North Carolina.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC93aGF0LWNvdWxkLWFuLW1sYi1zdGFkaXVtLWluLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1sb29rLWxpa2UtMjM2MDkzOC_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYmFzZWJhbGwvd2hhdC1jb3VsZC1hbi1tbGItc3RhZGl1bS1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtbG9vay1saWtlLTIzNjA5MzgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What could an MLB stadium in Las Vegas look like?,"With a 65000-seat stadium for the Raiders and a 18000-seat arena for the Golden Knights 30000 to 40000 seats for an MLB stadium would fit nicely in Las Vegas.

With the Oakland Athletics set to visit the Las Vegas Valley this coming week to discuss a possible relocation with area officials many wonder what a Major League Baseball stadium in the valley would look like.

The first consideration is size. In recent years baseball stadiums have been built with slightly smaller capacities which would likely be the case here. An MLB ballpark with 30000 to 40000 seats would fit nicely into the city’s professional sports landscape as it would fall in between the Las Vegas Raiders’ 65000-seat stadium and the Golden Knights’ 18000-seat arena.

To get a taste of just what an A’s stadium in the Las Vegas Valley could include look no further than the two newest ballparks in the majors.

A new example in Texas

The Texas Rangers’ Globe Life Field which opened last year sits on 13 acres of land in Arlington Texas that used to be a parking lot for their former field. The ballpark sits across the street from the Dallas Cowboys’ massive AT&T Stadium.

The 40000-seat facility features a key element that would also likely be needed in Las Vegas — a retractable roof. The hot summer days would make it a virtual must to be able to enclose the field during games.

It takes about 12 minutes to open the 24-million pound 5.5-acre roof which is composed of panels similar to what was used for Allegiant Stadium’s fixed roof.

There are 12 field suites located behind home plate and club seating on the lower levels of the stands on both the first- and third-base lines. There also are 71 suites for long-term founders of the park and 16 party suites.

Additionally the ballpark features themed clubs lounges and even a speakeasy all of which would make sense to include in a stadium anywhere but especially in Las Vegas. There’s a nightclub adjacent to one end zone of Allegiant Stadium.

A complex in Atlanta

Another new ballpark that includes elements that could work in Southern Nevada is the Atlanta Braves’ 41500-seat Truist Stadium. It’s located about 10 miles from downtown Atlanta which would be the equivalent to constructing the A’s stadium in west Henderson in relation to the Las Vegas Strip.

The 1.1 million-square-foot stadium features a three-level restaurant a rooftop lounge and an on-site brewery.

Also included in the project is an entertainment complex named the Battery Atlanta which includes dozens of bars and restaurants office space and a hotel.

Having a stadium built with an entertainment complex alongside could play into the planning of west Henderson as a number of mixed-use developments are planned for the area.

That area is quickly expanding and already houses the Raiders’ headquarters and practice facility. The Las Vegas Aces’ headquarters also is being constructed next door on Raiders Way.

The Strip vs the suburbs

Las Vegas Strip and the ease of access for tourists is an intriguing aspect for the A’s sources told the Review-Journal. That would be similar to what the Golden Knights have with T-Mobile Arena and the Raiders with Allegiant Stadium.

But constructing a stadium in one of the suburbs could work as well with the valley ever expanding. Knights owner Bill Foley said earlier this month he believes the valley could support another major professional sports team.

The Rangers’ and Braves’ stadiums are very similar to the plan Henderson officials presented to the Arizona Diamondbacks when they courted that MLB team in 2018.

Those plans called for a 32000-seat retractable roof stadium with room for 4000 standing-room-only ticket holders with adjoining office retail and residential buildings.

Henderson Mayor Debra March said she would be interested in revisiting those plans with A’s officials if the opportunity presented itself.

“We certainly had a proposal that we had put together for the Diamondbacks” March said. “We could definitely resurrect that and have a conversation. We would be interested in having a conversation certainly.”

Henderson officials initially said they didn’t have plans to meet with the A’s next week. When asked about that Friday Henderson spokesperson Kathleen Richards said an update wouldn’t be available until Monday because city hall is closed on Fridays.

The bottom line

The way Globe Life Field and Truist Park were funded are also blueprints for what the A’s may be looking for as sources indicated they are interested in a public-private collaboration.

Globe Life Field was built in such a partnership with the city of Arlington and the Rangers splitting the $1.2 billion cost.

Arlington’s share is coming by way of a ½ cent sales tax increase a 2 percent hotel tax and a 5 percent rental tax.

Truist Park completed in 2017 was also built with a public-private partnership with the Braves contributing $372 million and the remaining $300 million coming from Cobb County and the Cumberland Community Improvement District. The funds were generated by a combination of bonds and a transportation tax.

The Braves are also tabbed with paying for the Battery Atlanta complex which carries a $400 million price tag.

Seeking a similar deal?

A similar public-private partnership paid for the Raiders’ home Allegiant Stadium which was built with $750 million in public money.

That money is being generated by a 0.88 percent tax on hotel rooms in Clark County. With the pandemic impacting travel for much of the last year the room tax has been raising less than budgeted leading the county to dip into a debt reserve fund to make required bond payments.

In December the county pulled $11.6 million from the reserve account and it’s expected to pull another $12 million next week to make June’s scheduled payment said Jeremy Aguero a principal with Applied Analyst who serves as staff for the Las Vegas Stadium Authority.

Ava hit a three-run homer in the Tempe Regional final on Saturday May 22 2021 but the Cougars fell to Virginia Tech 11-3 in five innings.

BYU started its season in Tempe Ariz. and ended its season in Tempe on Saturday.

On a day when it seemed as if nothing could go right the Cougars fell to Virginia Tech a second time in the Tempe Regional — this time by the NCAA’s run rule in five innings 11-3 in the regional final. BYU had made it to Saturday’s game by winning two elimination games on Friday but the Hokies proved to be too much to handle.

Associate head coach Pete Meredith said the staff talked about how after the big emotional win Friday night the team was going to have to go in strong and attack. But the Cougars fell flat.

“I think the first inning was kind of indicative of that — we struggled to field balls and make plays” Meredith said. “... We’re not normally that kind of team but today we just couldn’t put it all together. Got to tip your hat [Virginia Tech is] a good team.”

The Cougars lost longtime head coach Gordon Eakin in the first inning when he was ejected for his reaction to an obstruction call that put the Hokies up 2-0.

In the bottom of the third BYU made two pitching changes. Arissa Paulson came in to take over for starter Autumn Koffat-Morth but was then replaced by Carley Brown after Virginia Tech got its lead up to 7-0.

The Hokies added a solo home run in the bottom of the fourth giving BYU only three more outs to keep the game alive.

And the Cougars responded.

BYU freshman Violet Zavodnik who earned West Coast Conference Player and Freshman of the Year honors hit a double with two outs to give the Cougars two runners. Next up Huntyr Ava homered to left field to bring in Zavodnik and Erin Miklus.

However after BYU got the momentum for the first time all game Virginia Tech responded with a two-run homer shifting the momentum back to the Hokies.

The Cougars continued to dig into their depth in the bullpen and brought out their fourth pitcher: Reggie Kanagawa.

Virginia Tech’s Alexa Milius homered to center field to still put an end to the game early.

“Obviously coming out of the bullpen is never an easy job but I was just trying to give them different looks trying to see if I could throw them off a little bit” Meredith said. “But they seemed to dig in and stick to their game plan. ... When you get to this caliber you’ve got to make them chase and expand. And we just didn’t do that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
TSN,Tyson Foods,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2FncmljdWx0dXJlL3Nob3BwZXJzLWFuZC1mYXJtZXJzLXNlZXRoZS1vdmVyLWhpZ2hlci1iZWVmLXByaWNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shoppers and farmers seethe over higher beef prices,"It’s not just consumers who getting riled up about rising beef prices. Cattle producers are too.

Cattle feeders are seething over a pattern they now consider all-too-familiar: the cost of hamburgers and steaks soar at the grocery store yet the prices they get for the animals barely budges. The market is dominated by four giant meatpacking companies that together control most of the U.S. beef processing.

“The current state of the cattle industry is egregious and must be addressed immediately” wrote Richard Godfrey president of the Iowa Cattlemen’s Association in a May 17 letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.

“Since August 2019 the cattle industry has suffered multiple extreme market disruptions often referred to as ’black swan events.’ These disruptions are unpredictable such as the Tyson plant fire in Holcomb Kan. or the supply chain disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and are often accompanied by a ripple effect directly or indirectly affecting the cattle industry for an extended period of time. Every market disruption comes with a significant price — some more than others.

“The cattle industry is particularly vulnerable due to few buyers in the market. In the current an oligopsony of four meatpackers control approximately 85 percent of the processing industry. The concentration of processing power between Tyson Foods JBS National Beef and Cargill has created a severe bottleneck in the beef supply chain during black swan events and has also opened the door for market manipulation.”

The ire is driving political momentum for more oversight of cattle markets just as antitrust and competition issues gain new traction in Washington where a backlash against Big Tech is fueling broader concerns about corporate behemoths abusing dominant positions.

The Biden administration views the pricing patterns in beef processing as evidence that concentration is having damaging effects on the supply chain and rural America a senior U.S. Department of Agriculture official said. USDA officials are looking at ways to use their regulatory authority to reduce the imbalance in market power.

Six farm and cattle trade groups recently united behind demands for meatpackers to disclose more information on cattle purchases and for the Justice Department to publicly report on an antitrust investigation it launched last May into the four major beef processors.

Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa were among lawmakers of both parties to introduce legislation calling for more transparency in pricing and terms of cattle purchases in the hopes it will give producers more leverage in transactions.

“Food doesn’t come from the grocery store it comes from tens of thousands of farmers and independent producers who work day and night to ensure families across the country have an abundant supply of food” Grassley said in a statement. “Independent producers deserve to be paid what their beef is worth.”

Rural lawmakers are sensitive to cattle producers' pain. Beef cattle operations account for more than a third of U.S. farms and ranches making it the single largest segment in the nation's agriculture. Ranchers are also hurting from an expanding drought. Feedlot operators who typically fatten cattle before they go to packers for slaughter face soaring corn prices.

""At home I hear about it all the time"" said GOP Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska who described encounters with cattle feedlot operators losing hundreds of dollars per animal. ""You can't stay in business with those kind of losses.""

According to the Iowa Beef Industry Council the state ranked eighth in the nation as of January for the total number of cows and calves. Iowa ranked 12th in the number of dairy cows and 13th in the number of beef cows. The industry says it contributes nearly $8 billion a year to Iowa’s economy.

Meanwhile with that at stake packers are prospering.

Tyson Foods. the largest U.S. meat company earlier this month reported record margins of 11 percent for beef in its second quarter. The company's stock is up 22 percent so far this year compared with 9 percent for the benchmark S&P 500 index.

The stunning beef profit margins eventually will decline but still remain above historical levels Tyson's Chief Executive Officer Dean Banks said at a conference this week.

With pandemic restrictions easing restaurants are reopening and buying meat. Flush with stimulus payments and improving incomes from a recovering economy Americans have been willing to pay up for more expensive steaks and burgers.

Since March 12 the wholesale price of beef has shot up 43 percent according to USDA. But cattle prices have risen only 5 percent.

Producers see a rerun of their plight during COVID-19 disruptions last year when virus outbreaks slowed slaughterhouses and the prior year when a fire temporarily shut down the plant in Kansas said Colin Woodall chief executive officer of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Each time beef prices soared while cattle prices dropped.

Renee Strickland a fourth-generation cattle rancher based in Myakka City Fla. said she sometimes has to pass up beef for chicken at the grocery store because it's too expensive for her.

""I'm just so angry that I can't afford the product that I produce"" she said.

The spread between the price packers pay for cattle and the price they receive for wholesale beef keeps hitting records first following the August 2019 fire and then after the pandemic hit. A USDA report that examined beefpacker margins reached no conclusion on whether prices were manipulated.

Greg Ibach the undersecretary of agriculture in the Trump administration who oversaw livestock market regulation said markets never really returned to normal levels after the Holcomb fire. In the year prior to the Aug. 9 2019 fire packers' operating margins on cattle averaged $137 a head. Since then it has averaged $331 a head according to data maintained by HedgersEdge.com.

""It never really has corrected itself"" Ibach said. ""I don't think the profits are being shared across the value chain in the same proportions that historically has happened.""

Meatpacking companies say they're constrained and struggling to attract workers particularly after the COVID-19 outbreaks that made the industry an early epicenter of the pandemic. Tyson executives said this month they've raised wages but still face high employee turnover and absenteeism.

""Despite the pandemic's challenges the market is competitive and growing"" said Sarah Little a spokeswoman for the North American Meat Institute a trade group in a statement.

There are nascent efforts to boost U.S. beef processing capacity.

Marfrig Global Foods SA in March said its subsidiary National Beef Packing Company is spending $100 million to more than double capacity at its plant in Tama to 2500 cattle daily by adding a second production shift. The changes will be done by late 2022 and there are other smaller plants in the works.

The USDA also is planning to use some funds from the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion rescue plan to help small- and medium-sized meat processors expand operations possibly using loan guarantees or grants.

""There's an opportunity for us to support additional processing capacity and hopefully a more competitive market"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack a former governor of Iowa.

Tough times on the farm also have an impact over time. Producers are expected to scale back herds in the coming months. That means the supply imbalance currently boosting packers will peak in 2021 and should eventually give more bargaining power to feedlots according to Glynn Tonsor agriculture economics professor at Kansas State University.

""Both of those adjustments will improve the relationship in favor of the cattle seller"" Tonsor said of more capacity and a decline in herds. ""We'll see more second shifts more new plants and fewer cattle.“

Bloomberg contributed to this report.

A variety of beef cattle are seen April 26 in a feed lot at Sievers Family Farms in Stockton. In a letter this month the Iowa Cattlemen’s Association said the sate of the cattle industry is “egregious” because only four meat processors dominate the market -- causing prices at the grocery story to skyrocket while farmers get less.

Cows stand in a pen March 2 at the Vaughn Farms cattle operation near Maxwell. Sudden meat shortages last year because of the pandemic led to millions of dollars in federal grants to help small meat processors expand so the nation could lessen its reliance on giant slaughterhouses to supply grocery stores and restaurants. But even with significant expansion capacity at the small processors pales in comparison to that of large meat processors that farmers complain are chocking the market.

The new owner of the U.S. Bank Tower will remove the Skyslide and Skyspace public observation deck the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.

The slide and deck opened in 2016 with the idea of making the tower a tourist attraction.

Located nearly 1000 feet (304.8 meters) above the ground the Skyslide is a see-through enclosure 45 feet long (13.7 meters) and made of 1.25-inch-thick (3.18 centimeter) glass. Visitors could slide from the 70th floor down to the 69th floor.

Developer Silverstein Properties bought the U.S. Bank Tower last year for $430 million and plans to spend $60 million on upgrades to make it more appealing to businesses in creative fields the Times reported.

Skyspace closed before the pandemic and will not reopen said Jeremy Moss head of leasing.

“While there are examples of observation decks and tourist attractions coexisting with workspace in this particular case I think that it was having too much of a negative impact on the experience that we wanted to create and preserve for the companies that are here” he said.

Skyspace floors will be turned back into office space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLXBvdC1zZWxsZXJzLXN0YXNoLWNhc2gtYmFua3MtbGVhdmUtdGhlbS1oaWdoLWRyeS0yMDIxLTA1LTI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Focus: U.S. pot sellers stash cash as banks leave them high and dry,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pot-sellers-stash-cash-banks-leave-them-high-dry-2021-05-24/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLXBvdC1zZWxsZXJzLXN0YXNoLWNhc2gtYmFua3MtbGVhdmUtdGhlbS1oaWdoLWRyeS0yMDIxLTA1LTI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzUvMjIvdXMtdG9wLWRpcGxvbWF0LWJsaW5rZW4tdG8tdmlzaXQtaXNyYWVsLXdlc3QtYmFuay1uZXh0LXdlZWvSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjEvNS8yMi91cy10b3AtZGlwbG9tYXQtYmxpbmtlbi10by12aXNpdC1pc3JhZWwtd2VzdC1iYW5rLW5leHQtd2Vlaw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US top diplomat Blinken to visit Israel West Bank next week,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit comes after a ceasefire was reached to end deadly Israeli attacks on Gaza Strip.

The United States’ top diplomat is expected to visit Israel and the occupied West Bank next week just days after a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Palestinian faction Hamas to end 11 days of deadly Israeli bombardments of the Gaza Strip.

An unnamed source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit Israel as well as Palestinian Authority leaders in the West Bank on Wednesday and Thursday.

The State Department has not yet released the full details of Blinken’s travel plans but the source told Reuters that Blinken would also visit Egypt and Jordan.

The trip comes days after Egypt helped broker a ceasefire to end Israeli attacks on Gaza that killed at least 248 Palestinians in the besieged coastal territory injured nearly 2000 others and destroyed buildings and critical infrastructure.

At least 12 people in Israel including two children were killed by rockets fired from the Strip by Palestinian armed groups.

US President Joe Biden’s administration had faced widespread pressure including from progressive legislators in Biden’s Democratic Party to pressure Israel to end its military assault on Gaza.

Biden hailed the ceasefire announced on Thursday but reiterated that “the United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks”.

In a statement that same day the State Department said Blinken in a phone call with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi also welcomed the ceasefire as well as Egypt’s mediation efforts to reach the deal.

Department spokesman Ned Price said Blinken “will meet with Israeli Palestinian and regional counterparts in the coming days to discuss recovery efforts and working together to build better futures for Israelis and Palestinians” during his visit to the region.

Al Jazeera’s James Bays reporting from West Jerusalem said “the bigger question for the Blinken visit is whether this changes the calculations of the Biden administration”.

Since coming into office in January Biden and his top officials had sought to “de-prioritise” the Israel-Palestine issue amid a string of other foreign policy priorities including the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and efforts to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal.

“Will they now change that and refocus on negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians and the US actively pursuing them?” Bays said.

Critics have questioned the Biden administration’s approach to the conflict urging the US president to publicly pressure Israel – which receives nearly $4bn in US military aid annually – rather than pursue “behind-the-scenes” diplomacy.

Progressive lawmakers are also pushing to cancel a $375m weapons sale to Israel arguing last week that the US should not be arming the Israeli military as it dropped bombs on Palestinians in Gaza.

Sultan Barakat of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies told Al Jazeera that while Biden stuck to the usual rhetoric about supporting Israel “the foreign policy agenda of the US is shifting here a little bit – partly driven by the Democrats’ focus on ethical foreign policy”.

“Of course this is a very difficult test” Barakat said. “If they start with this conflict and they’re not able to stand up for human rights then they’re doomed really for many years to come.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDUvZ3JhYi1kaWdpYmFuay1oaXJpbmctc2luZ2Fwb3Jl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grab ramps up digibank hiring poaches from Standard Chartered in Singapore,"Grab is ramping up its hiring for its Singapore digital bank poaching several people from brick-and-mortar competitors to fill senior roles over the past few months. The digital bank which is a collaboration with Singtel and is set to launch next year has a particular liking for tech professionals from Standard Chartered.

Gregory Sim has joined the digibank as it is called internally as chief information security officer. He previously spent more than six years at Stan Chart as head of cyber partnership and government engagement for Asia Pacific. Industry veteran Sim has also held security leadership roles with SGX CLSA and Citi.

Aniket Gadre Grab digibank’s engineering lead for quality assurance (QA) also hails from Stan Chart in Singapore where he worked for two and a half years as QA development lead for open banking. Tonia Chen was at SCB between April 2018 and February this year latterly as a UI/UX lead. She’s now a lead product designer at the digibank. Arun Manivannan came on board in February as head of data engineering. He joined from software consultancy ThoughtWorks and was at Stan Chart prior to that as a senior big data architect according to his LinkedIn profile.

Grab digibank has also been hiring from traditional banks for non-tech roles. Earlier this month Greg Cher joined has head of savings. He’d been with OCBC for nearly eight years most recently as head of deposits.

The online-only bank one of four to be granted licenses to operate in Singapore said in December that it is taking on 200 people by the end of 2021. Last year it named Charles Wong Citibank’s Singapore retail head as CEO. It also hired Jon Woods from US online bank Varo Bank as head of product.

While several senior appointments have been made many of these 200 positions are yet to be filled. Grab has 78 Singapore-based vacancies for the virtual bank according to its careers website. In technology these include jobs for data scientists mobile software engineers and product designers.

In December Grab touted long-term career development as its main calling card for attracting tech talent amid chronic skill shortages in Singapore. Grab employees have “opportunities to develop a broader and more complex set of capabilities through in-role expansion beyond-role exposure leadership engagement and mentorship and formal training and development” a spokesperson told us at the time. Grab did not comment on its more recent hiring from the banking sector.

Recruiters say people from mainstream banks are attracted to the Grab digibank because it offers the opportunity to work in fintech without the risks of joining a small startup. “It’s fintech but with some job stability” says one tech recruiter.

A senior technologist at a US bank told us in March that he had recently lost a strong team member to Grab. “I personally think it was a good career move for him because Grab is a local company and has much more interesting projects on offer than most foreign banks here do. We usually keep these roles overseas” he said.

Grab which is preparing for an upcoming listing on the Nasdaq via a record $40bn SPAC deal is generally able to offer pay rises of about 10% to 20% when it hires from banks say recruiters.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Companies With The Most Cash Reserves In America.

The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the economy in a way that no one thought possible. Back when the economy of the United States crashed in 2008 - 2009 and the rest of the world followed suit few people thought they would face an even worse disaster in 202o just over a decade later. But that is what happened in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic which originated in China spread across the world leading to over 170 million cases as well more than 3.5 million deaths. These figures themselves are likely to be extremely understated and we will know the true impact of Covid-19 in the coming years.

As countries started imposing lockdowns to battle this virus for which they had no solution economies which are entirely dependent on lockdowns well not happening. Most industries faced significant losses as economies collapsed and most countries across the globe entered into either recessions or depressions. Many companies had to incur massive losses as well as major layoffs as demand for most industries fell and going at the same rate as pre-pandemic made no sense at all.

Even though as I mentioned most industries and companies suffered some actually came out of the pandemic smelling like roses. Take Tesla for example. The market cap of the company jumped astronomically during 2020 making even ordinary shareholders into millionaires and making Elon Musk the richest man in the world and the highest earning billionaire in 2020 as well as the richest man in the world for a while. Tech companies generally managed quite well in fact with many companies reporting higher sales and profits as demand for tech increased while more and more people continued to work from home.

Another example is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America. Apple Inc has nearly $200 billion in cash and marketable securities. One would think that with a large number of its stores closed Apple would have suffered dearly during the crisis. Fortunately for Apple Inc. (AAPL) shareholders the company did well during the past 12 months and AAPL shares performed even better. The company used some of its cash hoard to continue paying dividends and buy back shares. Apple Inc. should have used its massive cash hoard to snatch some EV and battery companies on the cheap.

15 companies with the most cash reserves in America

Another technology stock that is among the companies with the most cash reserves in America is Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook Inc carries more than $60 billion in cash on its books and despite this huge buffer Facebook shares declined all the way down to $140 in March 2020. Mr. Market misjudged Facebook's potential for a few days but investors had a change of heart after a few weeks and Facebook shares returned more than 120% since its March 2020 lows. Unfortunately Facebook Inc's management didn't put its huge cash hoard into good use and take advantage of the opportunities.

Most of the companies that made our list of the 15 companies with the highest cash reserves in America are tech companies but you can also find non-technology stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Ford (NYSE:F) on our list. Costco was one of the beneficiaries of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic but JP Morgan Chase and Ford shares suffered large losses despite their cash reserves.

It would make sense that tech companies have massive cash reserves. Due to the high value of shares of these companies as well as the fact that their products are generally highly priced with significant margins these companies tend to have a lot of surplus cash on hand. However having a lot of excess cash can also be often considered to be a failure on the part of the company to have the cash simply lying around when it could be put to better use say on investing activities or to pay off debts which would allow the company to save significant money on interest payments. On the other hand having too little cash can give the signal that the company has liquidity issues and can also be perceived negatively by investors and shareholders. Therefore there is a fine balance to maintain one which many companies are able to maintain while others are not.

However in the era of Covid where the economy needs significant boosts it is frustrating many people including Wall Street that companies are sitting on massive piles of cash and yet are refusing to utilize it. As I mentioned earlier companies can use it for investing activities as well as acquisitions or by returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends which would gain them goodwill in an unprecedented year. Another option is buyback of shares from shareholders though detractors argue that this is simply a short term boost for investors while resulting in a long term effect on the health of a company.

Of course the simple reason would be that this isn't the best time really to spend money. The market is uncertain the economy will take a while to recover and while there is optimism on the horizon with vaccines being administered it is still a long haul process and not an immediate one. Hence companies are a bit cautious in investing money. Further the biggest companies in the world are also really big on acquisitions with Apple acquiring a hundred companies over the last 6 months. That means an acquisition every three to four weeks. Furthermore tech companies famous for having a lot of cash on hand are also known for sitting on said cash. And even though this doesn't mean that these companies are not spending cash at all it's just that many analysts believe that these companies are not doing as much as they do.

Coming up with the list of companies with the largest cash reserves in America was not an easy task. Search on the internet and you'll generally find tech companies and even then those articles are often outdated. Most people want to know the reserves that companies have now one year after the Covid-19 pandemic rather than back in 2019 or 2018. Hence we selected the biggest companies from the Fortune Global 500 list and focused particularly on the tech industry as it is true that these companies tend to have the most cash. We have selected the latest quarterly reports for each company and scoured the balance sheet to find out the cash reserves that these companies own. Due to the high liquidity of marketable securities we have considered them among cash equivalents as well though most other types of investments including long term investments have not been considered. Together these companies hold more than $1.1 trillion in cash alone which is truly an astonishing amount. So without further ado let's take a look at the companies which combined have more cash than most countries in the world starting with number 15:

UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9tYXkvMjMvZXh0ZW5kZWQtd2FpdC10aW1lcy1mb3ItdWJlci1seWZ0LWFyZS1yYWlzaW5nLWNvbmMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Extended wait times for Uber Lyft are raising concerns in Las Vegas,"Extended wait times for Uber Lyft are raising concerns in Las Vegas

When the Michigan couple visited Las Vegas last month they had to wait for nearly one hour at McCarran International Airport for a ride-share to the resort corridor.

Tuesday as they again approached the line they braced for another extended delay in starting their stay. They were among a crowd of several dozen in line at the airport’s Terminal 1 ride-sharing pickup area.

“It says it’s about a 20-minute wait which doesn’t seem that bad” said Delane Boog who had arrived minutes earlier with her husband Greg Boog ahead of a stay on the Strip at Park MGM.

Depending on the day time and location longer-than-normal wait times for Uber Lyft and taxi rides in Las Vegas have become common since visitation started to increase this spring after business closures and capacity limitations spurred by the coronavirus pandemic.

For Las Vegas which prides itself on service and a positive visitor experience it’s a phenomenon that Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom said could continue through the summer and negatively affect visitors’ reactions to their stay. The commission is the governing body of the Strip.

“I’ve seen a lot of complaints lately” Segerblom said. “I know people are also having to sometimes get an upscale Uber or Lyft in order to get a vehicle.

We need to get more drivers and it might take a few months to get caught up.”

Segerblom added that “part of what makes Las Vegas great is that it’s so simple. The airport is close to everything and we’ve had a great transportation system. If we lost that permanently it would be a disaster.”

Las Vegas is likely to be even more of a popular destination this summer as COVID-19 restrictions continue to be lifted around the country. And many domestic travelers will be heading here because international travel is still mostly dormant.

The Strip is already back to pre-pandemic numbers with packed restaurants droves of pedestrians along Las Vegas Boulevard and hotel occupancies rising like summertime desert temperatures. Capacity limits at venues and mask requirements for vaccinated individuals were lifted last week by the commission.

Ride-sharing services seem to have been caught on their heels.

“Demand has returned to the Las Vegas market very quickly” said Javi Correoso an Uber spokesman. “As people continue to become vaccinated we think that trend will continue for a city that attracts a lot of out-of-town visitors. Demand has returned quicker than drivers returning to the road which has led to some of the issues that we’ve been seeing in that market.”

The problem boils down to supply and demand: When visitors weren’t going out during the pandemic most drivers weren’t working. Now people are going out again and not enough drivers have returned to the roads.

Industry officials attribute the shortage to several factors including some drivers still collecting jobless benefits and others not ready to share a car with strangers during a public health crisis.

Representatives from Uber and Lyft acknowledge the driver shortage problem in Las Vegas pointing to a pandemic “state of emergency” rule put in place by Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak as the main culprit.

Under state law “transportation network companies” like Uber and Lyft cannot charge a fare “in excess of the base rate on file on the date of the emergency.”

Since Sisolak declared a pandemic state of emergency last year ride-sharing services can’t present “dynamic pricing” options which they say encourage drivers to work certain busy times because they can earn more.

Both Lyft and Uber are actively trying to get the Nevada Transportation Authority to alter its rules for dynamic pricing.

In a May 10 letter sent to the authority Lyft regulatory compliance manager Elizabeth Gallagher said “Fares collected by (transportation network companies) in excess of the base rate may be distributed to drivers throughout the region in the form of driver bonuses and incentives designated to get drivers on the road during periods of high demand.”

Meghin Delaney the governor’s communications director said the emergency declaration would stay in effect until the state’s chief medical officer notified Sisolak that the COVID-19 emergency has abated.

“Although the situation in the state of Nevada is improving COVID-19 is still with us and the governor’s advisers have not recommended terminating the declaration of emergency” she said.

While Segerblom and others wonder whether the companies should simply offer more base pay to drivers in an effort to attract more workers Correoso said it’s not that simple.

He said many drivers simply have returned to the workforce because they’re worried about contracting COVID-19 though Uber drivers and riders are still required to wear masks.

“What we’ve heard from drivers is that safety continues to be the No. 1 issue for them” Correoso said. “A lot of drivers haven’t returned because they don’t feel comfortable having someone in the car. As more people become vaccinated drivers are starting to return but we’re not where we were pre-pandemic.”

Correoso added that Uber was providing cash bonus incentives to drivers to return. A driver in Las Vegas averaging 20 hours on the road per week was taking home just under $30 per hour he said.

With visitor volumes increasing by the month however the driver workforce just isn’t keeping up.

In March according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority more than 2.2 million people visited the city a 45% increase from February. When the April visitation totals are released later this month they are expected to eclipse the March totals.

Along with the ride-sharing companies Las Vegas taxi providers are also finding it difficult to get drivers on the road.

JD Decker interim director for the Nevada Taxi Authority the agency that regulates the 16 cab companies operating in the state said it would take time to prime the industry after being basically dormant for months.

“We are seeing issues getting drivers in cars but companies are trying to hire” Decker said. “I think we’re probably suffering the worst of it right now. After being in isolation for so long people are coming back to Las Vegas but the taxi companies haven’t caught up yet. It will get back to normal but it’s going to take time.”

Just how much time remains anyone’s guess.

Decker said he’s aware of complaints about wait times that have trickled in from the public. He’s also heard from Las Vegas casino officials who have inquired about what could possibly be done to remedy the situation.

“It’s taking longer to get rides but visitors to Las Vegas do tend to find their way” Decker said. “There’s extra money going to drivers who take riders to and from McCarran and some companies are paying some of the permitting fees for cars. The companies know there’s an issue and they’re trying to see what works to help fix it.”

With Memorial Day weekend on the horizon and what’s expected to be a busy summer all for leisure travel it’s possible the driver shortage could get worse.

In April according to figures from the authority just under 897000 taxi trips were recorded.

That’s well up from the 12200 trips recorded in April 2020 during the height of the pandemic shutdown but still about 275000 rides short of what was recorded by the 16 cab companies in April 2019.

Along with the taxi and ride-sharing companies Las Vegas also has public transportation options.

The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada provides a bus line — its Maryland Parkway route — that connects to the airport.

From that line passengers can connect with the commission’s “Deuce on the Strip” line which travels up and down the tourist corridor from the South Strip Transit Terminal near the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center north to the Fremont Street Experience.

Francis Julien the RTC’s deputy CEO said the rideshare and taxi driver issues underscore the importance of public transportation options in Las Vegas.

He said there were cameras placed at bus stops so employees could monitor crowd levels. If too many riders are waiting Julien said the RTC will add vehicles.

“During the last couple Fridays and Saturdays we had a bus coming every eight minutes at peak demand along the Strip” Julien said. “People don’t have to wait 30 minutes. The increases (in riders) that we’ve seen the past four or five months we’re attributing basically all of that to tourists. The double-decker buses on the Deuce line also just offer an amazing way to experience the tourist corridor.”

Julien said that mobile phone users on the Uber or Lyft app actually have an option to purchase an RTC bus ticket without having to leave the ride-sharing app they’re using.

Still not everybody has a desire to ride a city bus even a cool-looking double-decker version. Many drivers have gotten used to the convenience of ride-sharing apps in recent years. And it’s not like it’s always difficult to hail an Uber or Lyft these days. Much depends on time and place.

At the airport Tuesday a few paces away from the Boogs Timothy Esposito and Kaylenne McClure both from Los Angeles waited for their Lyft after arriving from Southern California.

On McClure’s phone the Lyft app showed the pair would need to wait only a few minutes for their ride.

“We know things are opening up now so we knew there was a chance that we’d have to wait longer” McClure said. “But this isn’t bad at all.”

Segerblom said what’s happened with Strip transportation options was a good reminder of the “law of unexpected consequences” and he added that the longer wait times were the result of a free market problem that probably needed a free market solution.

“Before Uber and Lyft we had a great taxi system for the Strip though it wasn’t great if you weren’t on the Strip” Segerblom said. “When Uber and Lyft came in they basically decimated the cab industry here. We brought in this unregulated industry and now we’re paying for it. My thought is that we need to maybe try to limit Uber and Lyft so we can keep our taxi and bus system viable just in case something happens.”

A spokeswoman for the Nevada Resort Association said the organization has not heard complaints from its members about ride-sharing or taxi wait times at their properties. Representatives from the major Strip gaming companies had no comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS90cmF2ZWwvdHJpLXJhaWwtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC11YmVyLWZvci1mcmVlLXJpZGVzLXRvLWZyb20tc3RhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tri-Rail partners with Uber for free rides to from stations,"WEST PALM BEACH Fla. — If you're looking for easier ways for commuting to and from Tri-Rail stations one ride-sharing company is partnering with the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority to help you out.

A three-judge panel said that the lawsuit failed to connect a series of scandals that Uber faced in 2017 to a decrease in the company’s valuation.

In 2016 Irving Firemen’s Relief & Retirement Fund (Irving) a retirement fund for firefighters in Irving Texas acquired Uber securities through one of Uber’s preferred stock offerings. In 2017 there were multiple alleged corporate scandals including a blog post by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler describing her experiences of sexual harassment; Google affiliate Waymo suing Uber for theft of trade secrets; and a secret Uber program under which Uber collected data from the Uber app and other sources to identify and circumvents officials in jurisdictions prohibiting or restricting Uber operations. By early 2018 investors estimated that there was nearly a 30 percent decline in Uber’s valuation.

Because of this Irving proposed a class action suit against Uber and its cofounder Travis Kalanick in 2017 alleging a claim of securities fraud under California Corporations Code sections 25400(d) and 25500. The district court dismissed the claim for failure to state a claim. On appeal a three-judge panel affirmed the dismissal finding that Irving inadequately alleged that Uber and Kalanick’s alleged fraudulent misstatements and omissions caused its alleged losses.

Irving claimed that the district court erred by applying the federal standard for loss causation rather than the “less-rigid” state law standard. The appeals court held that California law only provided limited guidance on how causation should be applied and the lower court did not err by looking to federal cases interpreting loss causation claims brought under the Securities Exchange Act.

The panel held that appellants did not adequately allege loss causation because they did not “adequately and with particularity allege that those revelations caused the resulting drop in Uber’s valuation.” A chart was also included in the complaint that showed some Uber investors maintained or increased their company valuation following the scandals. Because of this the court affirmed the case’s dismissal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZ3VlMS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1LzIxL3VobHNwb3J0LXByZXNlbnRzLWxpZ3VlLTEtdWJlcnMtZWF0cy1vZmZpY2lhbC1uZXctYmFsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,uhlsport presents Ligue 1 Uber Eats official new ball,"For this new year of partnership the official match ball of the Ligue 1 Uber Eats for the first part of the season is dressed in new colours: fluorescent yellow navy and fluorescent red synonymous with freshness confidence and energy!

Five of these highly-exploited workers were killed on Australian roads in just two months late last year.

Uber Eats workers protest in Sydney in 2021

Far from being part of a fight to improve the atrocious conditions the rally was part of a campaign by the union to use the growing anger of delivery drivers to give the TWU a seat at the bargaining table with Uber. Called with just over a day’s notice and barely promoted by the union among delivery drivers let alone the working class more broadly the rally was attended by no more than 15 drivers. The small turnout was certainly not due to any lack of concern among workers about worsening pay and conditions in the industry.

Drivers who spoke to the World Socialist Web Site described growing pressure to make deliveries and a sharp decline in their income. One bicycle rider said after expenses are considered he makes an average of only $5 an hour. Another rider said he now makes $10 an hour during peak times half of what he used to earn.

Ady explained that when he started in 2017 he worked eight to nine hours a day five days a week and earned over $1000 a week from just one app.

Ady

“Now I am on every app” he said. “New ones keep coming and you just sign up hoping they will be better than the last but they are all just getting worse. The riders are facing the impact of this. A driver will try to get as much work as he can in the busy hours to maximise his earnings he doesn’t have any option. If he doesn’t do it then he may not get another order for the rest of the day.

“Just imagine the mental aspect of a person who is sitting in a car waiting for the next order to hit and if it is not coming then he is in a constant state of panic. It is getting worse and worse. Every passing day the rates are coming down. You could be online for a couple of hours and you won’t get anything.”

Vamshidhar said he started on a bicycle but after two years on UberEats he had his access suddenly cancelled due to “poor service” according to an email from Uber even though he delivered food in “bad weather conditions rainy days very hot days very busy days sometimes with very late pickups and drop offs at night.”

The rally was addressed by Michael Kaine national secretary of the TWU who lauded Tuesday’s decision by the Fair Work Commission (FWC) that former delivery driver Diego Franco was an employee of Deliveroo and that he had been unfairly dismissed by the company. Kaine presented the FWC’s decision as a “landmark ruling” that made Uber’s boardroom members “panic.” The ruling however was explicitly presented as a one-off case without any immediate impact on the status of any other rider.

Over the last four years the FWC has on four separate occasions ruled that delivery drivers are not employees but “independent contractors” with next to no legal rights or benefits. However the Deliveroo ruling as well as Uber’s recent out-of-court settlement over the alleged unfair dismissal of Amita Gupta and findings in the UK and elsewhere that delivery drivers are employees have prompted Uber competitor Menulog to work closely with the TWU to ensure that any changes to riders’ legal status has minimal impact on profit.

Kaine praised Menulog which he claimed had “come forward to say that things have to change.” The TWU is currently in negotiations with Menulog to establish the country’s first “on-demand industry award” which would change the status of delivery drivers to “employees” while continuing their exploitation and formalising the role of the union in the growing sector. The new award is necessary because Menulog is unwilling to accept the minimum shift lengths required under existing awards.

Menulog will soon begin a small trial in which delivery riders will be employed under the Miscellaneous Award meaning workers will be paid the minimum casual wage of $24.80 per hour. The company says it will also provide an injury insurance plan that is “as close as we can get to workers compensation.” When asked at a recent NSW parliamentary inquiry if the changes would “destroy” Menulog’s business Menulog Australia’s managing director Morten Belling bluntly replied “No. Otherwise we wouldn’t go down this path.”

Minimum wage and formal status as employees will not end the exploitation of delivery drivers. Indeed it will create new opportunities for employers to exercise control over workers. The nature of gig-economy work which requires workers to constantly run a GPS- and internet-connected smartphone app allows employers unprecedented scope to enforce performance targets and demand speed-ups.

Permanent employees will likely be unable to pick up rides from competitors reducing their potential sources of income. The establishment of a permanent low-paid workforce will also allow Menulog to reduce the number of riders on its books.

Kaine sought to promote illusions in the Labor Party who he said “has indicated what it will” address the conditions of gig-economy workers unlike the Liberal-National government. He called on Tony Sheldon a New South Wales (NSW) Labor senator who told workers “you should all be allowed to ensure you get minimum wage.”

Tony Sheldon [Photo: Australian Labor Party]

Sheldon directly appealed to the Coalition stating “This is a real opportunity for the government to turn around and say let’s have a bipartisan support for decent working conditions for everybody who works in this country.”

Sheldon’s posturing is bogus. It was the Labor governments of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating as well as the unions that signed a series of accords with big business in the 80s and 90s providing for the deregulation of the economy the destruction of hundreds of thousands of permanent jobs and the elimination of entire industries.

Since then Labor and the unions have worked hand-in-hand with corporations to suppress the class struggle and enforce one enterprise agreement after another that undermined secure working conditions paving the way for the gig-economy. As a result about one-third of Australian workers are now in insecure casual or part-time work or are “independent contractors.”

Sheldon played a central role in implementing this agenda in the transport and delivery sector. It was under his tenures as the TWU’s NSW state secretary (1999–2008) and national secretary (2006–2019) that the gig-economy became predominant in the delivery industry without the slightest opposition from the union.

The already rapid growth of the Australian food delivery industry—now worth $2.6 billion—was accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. Consumer spending in the sector has tripled since the beginning of 2020.

Mass unemployment and the federal government’s decision to exclude international students and overseas workers on temporary visas from any form of welfare during the pandemic without opposition from Labor helped ensure a ready supply of desperate riders and drivers for Uber and its competitors.

According to a report commissioned by Uber 59 percent of the company’s delivery riders began work during the COVID-19 pandemic 77 percent said they were ineligible for government support and 60 percent said they found it difficult to access “traditional” work.

The TWU is desperate to expand its deal with Menulog to include other companies such as Uber and Deliveroo. The establishment of delivery drivers as employees will potentially give the TWU access to a vast and untapped supply of membership dues. More than that it will enable the TWU to extend its role as an industrial police force in a growing sector of the economy in Australia and internationally which only exists due to the betrayals and defeats of the working class presided over by the unions over decades.

None of the measures presented by either Kaine or Sheldon have anything to do with defending the rights and conditions of delivery drivers. Workers should reject with contempt the demands by the TWU and Labor that they accept the poverty-level minimum wage.

Instead all workers should be provided with permanency and a living wage that eliminates the need to risk their lives to complete jobs or make quotas. But that requires a head on assault on the wealth of the corporate and financial elite which the unions and Labor oppose. The next step for delivery drivers is therefore to establish independent rank-and-file committees that can take forward a unified fight for wages and conditions."

Why Trust Us?

Jennifer Garner recently shared her new favorite moisturizer .

“It just gives the skin a real youthful vibrancy and a kind of bounce to it” she said.

Garner is also a huge fan of retinol and daily SPF.



For over 14 years Jennifer Garner has sworn by Neutrogena products to keep her skin glowing. As a brand ambassador she believes in them—and now at 49 she’s welcoming a new fav to the family: .

“It just gives the skin a real youthful vibrancy and a kind of bounce to it” Garner told People. That’s because it contains peptides which are proteins with a small molecular weight known to deeply penetrate the skin and help build collagen which keeps the skin smooth and firm.

This cream in particular—which can be used day and night—contains a 0.4% micropeptide as well as other skin-loving ingredients like shea butter glycerin and squalane for a dose of moisture as well as glycolic acid for gentle exfoliation.



So far it’s not just Garner who loves it. “All of a sudden I realized my face looks remarkable” one reviewer wrote after using the cream for a week. “The jaw line is lifted and tighter my forehead seems lifted and tighter. Lines beneath lower lip are almost gone. I look like I have had a face lift! Will be 68 years old in two more days. I just cannot believe what this product has done for my skin!”

“My cheekbones are more pronounced my face looks less puffy and my skin no longer looks/feels crepey” another reviewer raved.

In combination with her new moisturizer Garner continues to use her tried and true . That’s because it’s gentle enough for her easily-irritated skin. “It’s kind of a no-brainer at night. It does what it needs to do without turning me red and making my skin angry” she previously told Prevention.com.

And in the morning she’s all about sun protection in the form of . “If you’re in the sun you’ve got to have 100+ and you’ve got to reapply it religiously—and we all have to put more on than we think we do” she said. “[Sun damage is] lurking under there it’s hiding out and when you least expect it in your late 30s it’s going to show up.”

Her skin definitely speaks for itself!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3NjYWxwLXNjcnVicy0yMzAwMTc0NDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,14 scalp scrubs to treat and detoxify your scalp,"Looking for more beauty tips trends and editor-approved tricks and recommendations?

Choosing a scalp scrub is a lot like choosing skin care products: if your scalp is sensitive or greasy you'll need to stick with ingredients that treat the issue at hand.

Similar to our legs elbows face and heels the dead skin and product buildup that accumulates on our scalp needs to be exfoliated off. These days we can get a little extra help from some amazing scrubs.

With pool season in full effect proper cleansing and hydrating is important since chlorine can suck natural oils from the hair and skin leaving them dry rough and damaged.

Needless to say maintaining the health of your scalp health is crucial to maintaining healthy hair overall. If you're tired of flaking and dryness it's time to reverse damage caused by the pool styling products and chemicals.

But first how often should I scrub?

Like all good things scalp exfoliation is good in moderation. Some experts suggest scrubbing a healthy scalp every seven to 10 shampoos (unless you use an excessive amount of product on your head).

Since the glands on your scalp produce oil (sebum) that maintains the health of your hair and skin over exfoliation may throw off your scalp's pH balance which could cause it to overproduce oil.

That said if excess oil builds up a physical or chemical exfoliant is needed to help clear it away.

What type of scrub should I use?

Choosing a scalp scrub is a lot like choosing products for your face: if your scalp is sensitive or greasy you'll need to stick with ingredients that treat the issue at hand.

For sensitive scalps gentle polymer beads (which are free of microplastics) are a safe bet. If greasiness is a problem an oil-absorbing charcoal scrub is a great option.

For all of the hair product lovers out there the key to removing buildup is using a physical scrub that contains salt or sugar.

Developments announced this week by a pair of Chittenden County businesses have strengthened the case for the region’s future as a hub of innovation — particularly in wireless technology and electric aircraft.

Beta Technologies a South Burlington-based electric aviation start-up secured $368 million in private capital this week bringing the company’s valuation up to $1.4 billion. The company also announced plans to build a production facility for electric aircraft at Burlington International Airport.

GlobalFoundries a New York-based microchip manufacturer and one of Vermont’s largest private employers announced it will partner with Raytheon Technologies to develop and commercialize a special semiconductor component or microchip for the next generation of wireless infrastructure. GlobalFoundries will manufacture the chips at its plant in Essex Junction.

Cathy Davis president of the Lake Champlain Chamber of Commerce said both companies are poised to bolster the region’s growing tech sector and secure more high-paying jobs.

“It’s innovation and manufacturing” Davis said. “The amount of talent and innovation that’s happening at both of those companies in regard to the work they’re doing I think is incredibly important.”

The latest funding round for Beta Technologies comes on the heels of a deal with United Parcel Service in April to produce at least 10 aircraft — and potentially 150 more — for the shipping and logistics giant by 2024. Kyle Clark founder and CEO of Beta said the company is looking to add about 300 employees to an existing 230-person staff to meet production goals.

Beta’s Alia aircraft is entirely electric and has a half-plane half-helicopter design that enables vertical takeoffs and landings.

The Department of Defense is interested in the potential of the technology for military applications. In early May Alia became the first manned electric aircraft to receive airworthiness authorization by the U.S. Air Force for test flights through Agility Prime a public-private funding program with the Department of Defense.

The company was founded in 2017 and successfully partnered with United Therapeutics a biotechnology company to develop a prototype for transplant organs and tissues. The prototype led to a $48 million deal with United Therapeutics and Beta signed a “similarly sized contract” with the U.S. Air Force Clark said.

Chris Carrigan vice president of business development at the Vermont Chamber of Commerce said Beta’s work signals a “paradigm shift” in logistics and travel.

“It’s going to transform the way that we deliver goods and services and how we travel regionally” Carrigan said.

Carrigan who also manages the Vermont Aerospace and Aviation Association said ground-up aircraft manufacturing has historically concentrated on just three main hubs worldwide: Seattle home to Boeing; Montreal home to a cluster of aerospace companies; and Toulouse France home to aerospace giant Airbus.

Beta’s approach to building the aircraft from scratch “is really the first time it’s been done in New England” Carrigan said.

Beta is well positioned to scale up while staying local Carrigan said. Under Vermont law materials for the maintenance and repair of aircraft are exempt from the state’s aviation sales tax which keeps costs down in the long term.

In addition to the manufacturing facility the company recently completed a 14000-square-foot expansion of a hangar at Burlington International. Clark also expects to expand the facility that makes Beta’s charging stations located in Williston.

The partnership between GlobalFoundries which employs more than 2000 people at its Essex Junction plant and Raytheon an aerospace and defense company headquartered in Waltham Mass. also bodes well.

Raytheon’s proprietary “gallium nitride on silicon technology” will be licensed to GlobalFoundries as part of the agreement.

For years the industry trend was to drive down the size of microchips — but 5G wireless technology requires larger chips made with gallium nitride that can withstand more heat and tolerate higher voltage levels.

GlobalFoundries already makes larger chips which gives the company a competitive advantage.

The partnership has the support of Sen. Patrick Leahy D-Vt. who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. Leahy is a long-time backer of the GlobalFoundries plant in Essex and its predecessor company IBM which at one point employed as many 8000 people.

“With announcements like this one I see the potential for the future of American-made 5G and 6G running through Vermont” Leahy said in a statement to VTDigger.

The GlobalFoundries-Raytheon partnership is a testament to “how federal investments like in research and development can have profound economic benefits for Americans too” Leahy said.

A bill on the Senate floor this week would direct about $50 billion in emergency spending to stimulate development in the microchip industry including GlobalFoundries.

Leahy’s office confirmed that the senator also helped acquire an extra $25 million for the Agility Prime program from which Beta now benefits.

GlobalFoundries will invest $1.4 billion to ramp up production of larger-sized chips at three more plants worldwide in order to address a nationwide microchip shortage.

Carrigan said the GlobalFoundries-Raytheon partnership is a welcome addition to the state’s $3 billion manufacturing economy.

“Any strategic investment in the Vermont plant is a good thing” Carrigan said.

Lindsay Kurrle secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development said cutting-edge developments at GlobalFoundries and Beta could have draw workers to Vermont.

It “not only attracts young talent from in and out of state” Kurrle wrote in a statement to VTDigger “but it provides community support new and potential business partnerships and supply chain opportunities.”

In “Fast Friday” practice where teams received elevated boost levels in the engine turbochargers drivers were reaching no-tow speeds faster than 230 mph.

Alexander Rossi appears to be a hot favorite for the NTT P1 Award for pole. 2016 Indy 500 winner Rossi led the field Friday in no-tow speeds in the No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS/AutoNation Honda with a best lap of 231.598 mph. Following him on the no-tow list were Graham Rahal in the No. 15 United Rentals Honda at 231.518 mph and Pato O’Ward in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet at 231.510 mph.

Six-time and defending NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Scott Dixon will be the first driver to roll out for qualifying this morning after Team Manager Mel Harder drew P1 for the 2008 Indy 500 winner. That will give the advantage of presumably the coolest track temperatures for Dixon who also had the fourth-fastest no-tow speed Friday at 231.502 and is a leading favorite to claim his fourth career Indianapolis 500 pole.

Defending Indy 500 NTT P1 Award winner Marco Andretti rolls off second with 2014 Indy 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay third three-time race winner and four-time pole winner Helio Castroneves fourth and Ed Jones fifth.

The action starts at 9:30 a.m. (ET) with a one hour Indianapolis 500 practice session live on Peacock Premium. Then Crown Royal Armed Forces Qualifying can be seen live on Peacock Premium from noon-6 p.m. Live coverage can also be seen on NBC from 2-3 p.m. and on NBCSN from 3-6 p.m.

Here’s what you need to know to be ready for today’s qualifying session.

This Is No Walk in the Park

The four-lap 10-mile run to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 is one of the most daunting challenges in motorsports.

Thirty-five drivers will try to put together four perfect laps that feature 16 corners at speeds faster than 230 mph just for a shot at one of 33 spots in the field for the Indianapolis 500. Even the slightest tick of the steering wheel or gust of wind can drop a driver’s speed. These drivers must be perfect.

They also must be consistent. This isn’t a one-or-two-lap run. These drivers must go all-out for four laps to try to make the field for “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.”

In practice for the Indianapolis 500 drivers struggled to put together four laps near the same speed so consistency could be hard to find this year. Part of that was due to heavy traffic which won’t be an issue today in single-car qualifying. But part was the challenge of riding the lightning bolt when the cars are trimmed out for pure speed.

Watch The Weather

The drivers are in for a warm afternoon in Speedway Indiana with highs in the mid-80s and wind gusts coming in just under 10 mph. The humidity is expected to be around 40 percent when qualifying beings at noon (ET) and is expected to fall to 36 percent by the time qualifying ends at 5:50 p.m.

The cooler the conditions the faster the race cars. In turn a hotter racetrack will have less grip and result in slower speeds. That’s why Friday’s qualification draw was so important. The earlier in the session these athletes hit the track the better chance they have at making the Fast Nine Shootout.

Weather also will be the battle within the battle later in the afternoon once every driver in the field has made a four-lap attempt and the session opens for anyone to make additional qualifying attempts.

Do you want to go out earlier in the afternoon when there may be more cloud cover? Or do you want to go back out late in the session when the sun is beginning to drop in the sky and track temperatures might be cooler? Keep in mind at any time a cloud could move in front of the sun and cool the racetrack or wind might pick up in a certain direction that would be optimal for a qualifying run.

As you can see qualifying for the Indianapolis 500 is…complicated.

Qualifying Explained

Today all 35 drivers attempting to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 will be guaranteed one four-lap attempt. From there the session will open for all drivers to make as many qualifying attempts as time permits.

At the end of the day drivers who clock in average speeds from positions 10-30 will have their starting spots locked in. The fastest nine entries are locked into the Fast Nine Shootout on Sunday while the drivers between 31-35 will move on to Last Chance Qualifying on Sunday where two drivers will be bumped from the field.

Now back to that question about cloud cover and wind gusts.

Pit lane will feature two lanes for teams to put their cars into: the normal lane and the fast lane. Any team looking to improve their qualifying time without withdrawing their established time will enter the normal lane.

But if a team wants to rush out onto the track to catch the perfect conditions or to beat the clock at the end of the day they can choose the fast lane. However a car in this lane with an established time must withdraw the time before making the next four-lap run.

Obviously this comes with some risk. Sometimes the reward pays off sometimes it doesn’t.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Goodman Independent Institute 384 pages $29.95

In the Depression summer of 1934 President Franklin D. Roosevelt gradually concluded that the country needed a broad-based government-led program to assure Americans' economic security. He thus created the Committee on Economic Security led by such long-forgotten policy mechanics as Frances Perkins Arthur Altmayer Edwin Witte and Wilbur J. Cohen.

The Committee begat the Social Security Act of 1935. The legislation's central feature was billed as ""social insurance"": Workers would make contributions throughout their working lifetimes the government would invest the funds in special Treasury notes the earnings would accumulate and at age 65 or upon disability the workers would begin to draw retirement benefits. What could go wrong?

Thirty years later big government had advanced far enough in public esteem for presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to expand social insurance to include government-managed health insurance for retired workers (Medicare) and government-paid health care for the poor (Medicaid). The chief policy mechanic for this great leap forward was Cohen who ended up serving as secretary of health education and welfare for the last seven months of Johnson's presidency.

Let's engage in a counterfactual. Suppose those social insurance plans had been designed by libertarian-leaning policy mechanics. What would they have produced?

In New Way to Care economist John C. Goodman supplies a plausible answer to that question. Goodman reveals the disincentives inefficiencies hypocrisies astronomical unfunded liabilities and general absurdities in the programs that currently exist. Then he goes beyond that to lay out the policy alternatives that he argues would make the American social security disability and health care universe effective consumer-centered and above all pro-liberty.

Goodman has authored at least 26 books on health and welfare policies since 1980. His most influential work was probably Patient Power: Solving America's Health Care Crisis written with Gerald Musgrave and published in 1992. That 657-page magnum opus reviewed the evolution of health care policies in the U.S. and abroad. It lucidly explained why competitive markets and informed and empowered patients lead to efficient and beneficial outcomes while turning over patient care to government bureaucracies inevitably leads to inefficient and sometimes calamitous mistreatment.

At that date this notion was considered borderline preposterous by orthodox health policy wonks whose differences arose mainly over how and to what extent the government should control health care who should be made to pay and what sort of provider organizations and business plans were most desirable. No one has done more than Goodman to force the principles of patient choice and provider competition upon a health policy community that has been uncomfortably resistant at best and relentlessly opposed at worst. Goodman is widely credited as the father of health savings accounts an idea that Congress enacted in 2003 and now benefits more than 25 million American families.

In his new book Goodman asks the pointed question: Why is government involved in retirement security medical care disability support and unemployment payments? ""For elderly entitlement programs"" he writes ""we have made promises to future retirees that far exceed the revenue that will be there to fund them. In fact the unfunded liability in [federal] elderly entitlement programs alone is about six times the size of the entire economy."" What's more ""Even when a social insurance program is reasonably funded individuals invariably face perverse incentives to behave in ways that undermine the purpose of the program and increase the costs for others.""

Goodman goes to considerable lengths to identify those federal programs' defects few of which were imagined by Wilbur J. Cohen and his colleagues. A six-page appendix concisely explains what socialized medicine actually looks like in practice. One would hope that this recitation would give reasonable people pause. For example under the much-touted Canadian single-payer system the care is rationed mainly by waiting. ""In 2016"" Goodman writes ""Canadians waited an average of 21.2 weeks between referral from a general practitioner to receipt of treatment by a specialist—the longest wait time in over a quarter of a century of such measurements.""

Goodman focuses on how to deal with real risks that people face: outliving one's assets dying and leaving your family without resources becoming disabled and facing financial ruin becoming unemployed and finding no market for your skills or surviving a pandemic. A two-word summary of his solutions would read: ""opt out."" Goodman wants people to be able to exit dysfunctional systems both to improve their own circumstances and to give those systems an incentive to improve. More expansively Goodman wants all of those programs if not totally scrapped then redesigned to maximize choice and responsibility in light of sound economic principles.

There are some complications. One can imagine the better students of a yearlong college course taught by Goodman using this book as a financial planning handbook. But most people are likely to have a hard time working their way through some of Goodman's solutions. And it's hard to imagine some of them however defensible they may be in an economics seminar becoming viable policy alternatives in Congress.

Take opting out from the Social Security program. Goodman suggests that the government give a young worker the opportunity to make a one-time lump sum payment in lieu of ever paying payroll taxes or accepting any benefits. Then he could use 4 percent of his untaxed wage income to make investments that would produce larger benefits than what he forswore over his expected lifetime.

Or: A worker who has vested Social Security benefits could take an early buyout in an amount determined by life expectancy and a government discount rate. He could then take the cash and put it to work at what he expects to be a more advantageous rate.

A young Milton Friedman might have jumped at those offers but one may fairly suspect that many young people today will not unless they have an appreciable amount of assets to begin with.

Another economically but not politically defensible idea is for the government to allow health insurers ""to sell insurance that substantially restricts largely futile end-of-life care."" This would offload to insurers the practice of the U.K.'s National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness (NICE)—that is expertly establishing a cost-benefit tipping point beyond which the National Health Service won't pay for any more care. Just imagine an insurance salesman trying to make a pitch for such a policy.

These may not be plausible as political proposals but they are worthwhile as thought experiments. And Goodman produces dozens of less sweeping reforms that would expand personal responsibility and allow more choices. Many of these are or should be within the realm of practicality.

Goodman defends several program changes made under the last administration. Chances are that President Donald Trump had little awareness of what his appointees were actually doing but Goodman rightly credits the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services director Seema Verma. She found ways without legislation to expand virtual health care technology in a pandemic pay doctors for ""virtual check-ins"" create ""right to try"" treatment options protect emergency use of health savings accounts expand opportunities to buy lower-cost short-term insurance coverage and increase medical price transparency.

Unsurprisingly The Washington Post reported in February that President Joe Biden's HHS appointees ""are preparing dozens of regulatory actions to roll back much of the previous administration's legacy. That legacy largely loathed by liberals emphasized personal responsibility over government assistance and individual freedom over consumer protections.

As in Patient Power Goodman looks for creative market-oriented practices abroad even when they occur within an otherwise unappealing political context. Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for example replaced his country's collapsed social security system with one based on worker-owned accounts. These became popular precisely because employees not the corrupt government owned them. (Chile also created a private disability insurance program in which ""Workers make additional contributions to their retirement accounts to cover the contingency of disability and they pay fees for group disability coverage for any portion of their wages that can't be replaced from their own accounts."")

Similarly while Singapore is an illiberal society in several notable ways it has adopted what Goodman calls ""the most successful social security system in the world."" There he explains ""people are required to save a substantial part of their income to meet basic needs."" Unfortunately Goodman devotes only three paragraphs to the Central Provident Fund's successes.

New Way to Care is enormously valuable for anyone engaged in the debates over the future of retirement disability unemployment and health care policies. Life would be better for all Americans if John Goodman and other market-oriented health policy practitioners could achieve majority support.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtaW5kaXZpZHVhbC1tYW5kYXRlLXBvbGljeS1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtaWRlYS1oaXN0b3J5LTQ4OTk1NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Tortured Saga of America's Least-Loved Policy Idea,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/22/health-care-individual-mandate-policy-conservative-idea-history-489956 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtaW5kaXZpZHVhbC1tYW5kYXRlLXBvbGljeS1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtaWRlYS1oaXN0b3J5LTQ4OTk1NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYXJjaHB1YmxpY2hlYWx0aC5iaW9tZWRjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4xMTg2L3MxMzY5MC0wMjEtMDA2MDEtONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Different configurations of the two-step floating catchment area method for measuring the spatial accessibility to ...,"Setting

This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 in Ahvaz the capital city of Khuzestan Province in Iran. Ahvaz’s population has over 1186000 inhabitans and covers an area of 258 km2 with a average population density of 7771 per km2 [36] (Fig. 1). In this research neighbourhood was the spatial unit in all analyzes. On average each neighbourhood covers an area of about 4 km2 and has an average population of 17000 people.

Data/participants

In this study “people living with disability” refers to those people who live with one or more physical intellectual visual hearing speaking and mental impairments. Disability data were obtained from the Welfare Organization of Khuzestan Province in 2020 [37]. No sample was taken and all disabled people (n = 16186) were included in the study. Demographic data of the 68 neighbourhoods came from 2016 census blocks [38] and were joined to the neighbourhood spatial layer (as polygon features). Hospitals locations data (as point feature) were obtained from Ahvaz Municipality [36] and they were updated using the outage management system (OMS) online dataset [39]. The addresses of the people living with disability were geocoded and then spatially joined to the neighbourhood layer. The hospital capacity was represented by the number of beds per hospital.

Spatial statistics

Network analysis

In order to measure the demand locations we followed Luo and Wang [26] approach using disability-weighted centroids and calculated by centroid tool in ArcGIS version 10.7.1 (ESRI Redlands CA USA). The network analysis dataset included neighbourhoods centroids as origins points hospitals as destinations and streets by hierarchy. Topology checks were performed to resolve connectivity issues. One important parameter in measuring the spatial accessibility is the drive distance between the supply and demand (hospital and home) locations [30]. Using a travel-time threshold (d) of 5 min in the 2SFCA calculation an acceptable spatial distance to hospitals in Iran’s metropolitan areas has been estimated at 1–1.5 km travel-distance (0.621–0.932 mile) or at 5–10 min travel-time [40]. The estimated 5 min travel-time buffer for each neighbourhood’s centroid and hospitals service area zones was derived from the ArcMap Network Analyst tool. Based on the hierarchy and speed category within the road network the standard speed was set at 80 km/h for expressways 60 km/h for main roads 40 km/h for secondary roads and 30 km/h for local roads.

Four methods were used to measure the PSA to hospitals among people living with disability in Ahvaz based on the calculated distances as follows:

1. The 2SFCA method:

An access score ratio computed for each neighbourhood using the 2SFCA approach. In step 1 following previous studies [24 35] we looked for the location k of all people living with disability within the threshold travel-time d 0 of 5 min from hospital j (i.e. the catchment of this hospital location) and computed the bed-to people living with disability ratio R j within the catchment area by eq. 1 provided in Additional file 1.

In step 2 we looked for all hospital locations (j) for each neighborhood centroid i within the threshold travel-time d 0 of 5 min from location i (i.e. the catchment area) and summed up the bed-to-population ratios R j (calculated in step 1) at these locations by eq. 2 provided in Additional file 1.

2. The E2SFCA method:

Since the 2SFCA method did not consider distance decay effect in calculating PSA it led to unrealistic estimates of the access scores. To overcome this limitation we applied the E2SFCA method introduced by Luo et al. [27 41] and deployed in our setting as follows:

In step 1 catchment areas set at 5 10 and 15-min drive time to hospital location j were used i.e. catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively as it can be seen in Fig. 2. We searched all people living with disability population locations (k) within the threshold travel-time zone (D r ) from location j (i.e. catchment area j) and computed the weighted bed-to-population ratio R j within the catchment area using eq. 3 provided in Additional file 1. Following previous studies [11 24 41 42] in this equation W r represents the distance weight for the rth travel-time catchment calculated by the Gaussian function. The weights set (1.00 0.68 0.22) were used for capturing the distance decay of access to the hospital j.

Fig. 2 The three catchment areas used with the neighbourhood unit for calculating the PSA Full size image

In step 2 we searched all stations locations (j) for those living with disability in neighborhood i within the 15-min travel-time catchment from neighbourhood i (i. e. catchment area i) and summed up the bed-to population ratios R j (calculated in step 1) at these neighbourhoods by eq. 4 provided in Additional file 1. The same distance weights derived from the Gaussian function used in step 1 were applied to different travel-time zones to account for the distance decay.

3. The disability-severity 2SFCA approach:

People living with disability have diffenet needs and the level of accessibility to health care based on the type and degree of impairment and disability [5]. To integrate severity of disability as a significant non-spatial factor of accessibility into our access measure we included the severity as weights in the accessibility formula to measure the effect of severity on the PSA score. We set the weight for each severity degree category based on real registered data as follows: 1). Mild; 2). Moderate; 3). Severe; and 4). Very severe disability. After that for each neighbourhood the number of disabled people was multiplied by the severity weight. By integrating the severity weights into 2SFCA method the PSA could be updated as follows;

In step 1 we searched all people living with disability locations (k) for each hospital j within the threshold travel-time d 0 of 5 min from the hospital (i.e. the catchment of this hospital location) and calculated weighted population by multiplying the associated weights with the number of people living with disability in each severity category. Then the weighted bed-to population ratio R j within the catchment area was calculated by eq. 5 provided in Additional file 1.

In step 2 we searched all hospital locations (j) for each neighbourhood centroid i within the threshold travel-time d 0 of 5 min from location i (i.e. catchment area i) and summed up the bed-to-population ratios R j (calculated in step 1) at these locations as shown in eq. 6 provided in Additional file 1.

4. The disability-severity E2SFCA approach:

This method represents a compounded use of methods no. 2 and 3. In this approach which used the same equations (Eq. 5 & Eq. 6) as method no. 3 we applied weights for the severity of disability (varying between 1 and 4) to calculate the accessibility measure.

Visualisation and mapping techniques

For the purpose of visual comparison we categorised the PSA scores into the same intervals for the four methods investigated (Fig. 3). To obtain the relative PSA score the maps corresponding to the four methods were overlaid by calculating the average of accessibility scores of the four methods for each neighbourhood (Fig. 4b).

Fig. 3 (a) PSA for total people with disability experience (2SFCA) (b) PSA for severity integrated people living with disability (2SFCA) (c) PSA for total people living with disability (E2SFCA) (d) PSA for severity integrated people living with disability (E2SFCA) Full size image

Evaluating performance of the implemented methods to measure PSA to hospitals

We computed the closest distance to hospitals for each geographical neighbourhood centroid for validation of the access measure results (see Fig. 4a). Therefore for each neighbourhoud in addition to the four accessibility scores obtained by the four methods the distance from neighbourhood’s centroid to the closest hospital was also calculated. Further we used Spearman’s correlation to measure the relationship between the four methods scores with values for the distance to the closest hospital. Spearman correlation coefficient ranged from − 1 to + 1 where + 1 indicates the strongest possible agreement in the same direction − 1 indicates the strongest possible agreement in the reverse direction and 0 shows no agreement between two measures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RlYWNoZXJzLXVuaW9ucy1hbmQtZWR1Y2F0aW9uLW9mZmljaWFscy1wdXNoLXdva2UtbGVmdGlzdC1wb2xpY2llcy1pbi1zY2hvb2xzLWFjcm9zcy11c9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RlYWNoZXJzLXVuaW9ucy1hbmQtZWR1Y2F0aW9uLW9mZmljaWFscy1wdXNoLXdva2UtbGVmdGlzdC1wb2xpY2llcy1pbi1zY2hvb2xzLWFjcm9zcy11cy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teachers unions and education officials push 'woke' leftist policies in schools across US,"Many teachers and teachers unions in recent years have pushed left-leaning policies both in schools and in the public sphere – a phenomenon that's been highlighted by a more intense focus on schools and unions amid the coronavirus pandemic and battles over how to teach about race in schools.

The progressive push goes from individual classroom teachers all the way to the highest education officials in the land including President Joe Biden's Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. The ideas and policies advocated range from anti-racism to single-payer health care to ending ""male-centric"" language.

""We need teachers behind this wave of our curriculum becoming more ‘woke’"" Cardona wrote in a 2019 email when he was the Connecticut education commissioner. Fox News obtained the email via a Freedom of Information Act request.

Cardona was discussing strategy for drafting and promoting a new class on Black and Latino studies which will be mandatory for all Connecticut students starting in fall 2022. ""Under the leadership of Secretary Cardona the Department of Education remains committed to advancing educational equity and ensuring that we prioritize replicate and invest in what works for all students not just some"" a US Department of Education spokesperson said in response to Fox News revealing the email.

But the progressive lurch among educators and education officials is often just as prominent in teachers and local school officials as it is among high-profile individuals like Cardona. The teacher Cardona was advocating be on the panel to help create the Black and Latino studies curriculum named Meghan Hatch-Geary presents herself on Twitter as an ""antiracist-focused educator."" She issued a statement lauding Cardona for caring about what teachers think so they would ""be on board w/ this vital initiative.""

In more recent news the New York Post reported this week that a middle school principal in Brooklyn wrote an email asking teachers to take a political stand against Israel amid the fighting between the Jewish country and the Hamas terrorist organization.

""You can take action today by protesting attending a vigil making a public commitment to Palestinian Liberation signing a petition or calling your government officials to place sanctions on Isreal (sic)"" the email said according to the Post. ""The time is now to take a stand for those impacted by state-sanctioned violence and crimes against the humanity of the most vulnerable in our world.""

We need teachers behind this wave of our curriculum becoming more ‘woke' — U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona

NYC PRINCIPAL UNDER FIRE FOR EMAIL IMPLORING STAFF TO SUPPORT PALESTINIANS

Meanwhile a trove of public records released on Wednesday by the conservative nonprofit Judicial Watch showed that Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) in Maryland spent $454000 in November on an anti-racism audit.

The goal of the audit according to the Mid-Atlantic Equity Consortium which was given the money was to ""provide an opportunity to examine the district’s systems practices and policies that do not create access opportunities and equitable outcomes for every student’s academic and social emotional well-being."" MCPS did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News before a story published Friday.

Also revealed last week a Massachusetts school district barred White students from a March ""Healing Space"" event according to a federal civil rights complaint filed by the group Parents Defending Education. An email included in the complaint said the event was hosted by the ""[Wellesley Public Schools] Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion."" It was designated for students in 6-12 grade and ""faculty/staff.""

""*Note: This is a safe space for our Asian/Asian-American and Students of Color *not* for students who identify only as White"" a March 2021 email read. Following the event the school district's superintendent doubled-down on excluding certain students from some events in an email that said the district had come to ""unequivocally affirm the importance of ‘affinity spaces.'"" School officials did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment sent in regards to the complaint.

Teachers unions have been in the spotlight recently over the fact that in many areas around the country they blocked local governments' efforts to get students back to in-person learning.

But the unions previously often gained attention for their left-leaning politics – donating heavily to Democrats over Republicans in every election cycle since at least 1990 according to Open Secrets.

During its 2020 convention the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) bragged that it passed ""a raft of bold progressive resolutions"" including some that had nothing to do with education.

One resolution backed universal health care coverage by 2025 ""through single payer or private insurance with a public option.""

PENN STATE FACULTY VOTE TO END TERMS ‘FRESHMAN’ ‘SOPHOMORE’ & OTHERS

AFT President Randi Weingarten said in 2019 that ""there should be a single payer using Medicare as a floor and not a ceiling.""

Another 2020 AFT resolution on police brutality asserted that ""white supremacy is systemic and institutionalized and influences the lives of everyone living in the U.S."" and said that the union would make ""anti-racist and anti-oppression training for all members a principal goal of the unions.""

The left-leaning actions of many educators are not limited to K-12 however. Pennsylvania State University's Faculty Senate earlier this year voted to replace the words ""freshman"" ""sophomore"" ""junior"" and ""senior"" with ""1st year"" ""2nd year"" etc. … citing the ""male-centric academic history"" built into those terms.

The decision came as part of a Faculty Senate bill on the ""Removal of Gendered & Binary Terms from Course and Program Descriptions.""

""Many terms in our lexicon carry a strong male-centric binary character to them. Terms such as ‘freshmen’ are decidedly male-specific while terms such as ‘upperclassmen’ can be interpreted as both sexist and classist"" the Faculty Senate bill said. ""Terms such as ‘junior’ and ‘senior’ are parallel to western male father-son naming conventions and much of our written documentation uses he/she pronouns.""

The university said in a statement to Fox News that the decision would be reflected in course and program descriptions although it did not necessarily represent the Penn State administration or board of trustees which are separate from the Faculty Senate.

""The Faculty Senate’s decision pertains only to changes to course and program descriptions which are within the purview of the Faculty Senate"" the statement said. ""These changes have occurred at many universities across the nation. We understand and respect that there are different viewpoints on these matters.""

The Sindh government and the World Bank agreed to finalize the project by completing its remaining documents so that it could be started from next financial year.

The World Bank would finance 85 per cent of the project while the provincial government would pitch in 15pc funds.

CM Shah said that it would be called ‘Sindh 1000 Days plus programme’ aimed at further strengthening the continuum of care for integrated healthcare services for universal health coverage.

He added human capital formation would be made through integrated health early child education adult literacy skill development for women economic inclusion and a social registry.

Mr Shah said that selected interventions would be implemented through public private partnership (PPP) such as social registry skills development ambulance microfinance telehealth and others.

The CM discussing the details of the project said that out of 30 districts 271 underserved union councils were selected.

According to Mr Shah out of total 1093 government dispensaries (GDs) 293 were selected on the criteria based on two factors — the GD located at four kilometres distance from a basic health unit (BHU) and the GD which has no coverage of lady health workers. “On average each GD is nine kilometres away from a BHU” he elaborated and added that initially 93 GDs located in five districts — Tharparkar Thatta Sujawal Jamshoro Qambar-Shahdadkot — would be covered while the rest would be covered after one year of the initial programme.

It was pointed out that according to research conducted in 2017-18 distance from a health facility was one of the major reasons for not seeking healthcare. This barrier is more profound in terms of adolescents widowed divorced remote areas uneducated women and lowest wealth quintile the study said.

The study says children who live at a distance of five kilometres from a facility are 17pc more at risk of mortality. Distance is the most important factor that influences the utilization of health services.

Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said that 293 dispensaries would cover a population of 9.744 million. The GDs would be integrated with district health systems such as DHQ THQ RHC and BHU through 88 ambulances meaning one ambulance for a cluster of five dispensaries.

Amongst the components of the project are The Reproductive Maternal Newborn and Child Health (RMNCH) and Formation of Medical Record System.

Component three of the project includes early child education learning and skill development for adolescent girls.

Under the components school infrastructure and community support for Early Child Education (ECE) to improve equity access school readiness and retention would be enhanced and expanded.

Social protection for women and girls’ economic inclusion and empowerment based on socioeconomic components of the project would cost $126m.

Under the scheme a social registry would be developed. The chief minister said that the economic empowerment of women and girls would be made through financial literacy skill development micro-financing and training as community health workers

He said that Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has shown interest in social protection and it would incorporate it in PC-1 under a partnership component.

Under the scheme telehealth services would be established and promoted.

The World Bank team discussed all the components in the meeting and agreed to finalize the remaining documents and approvals so that it could be started from next financial year.

Recognising outstanding examples of voluntary work the King’s Award for Voluntary Service (KAVS) was created in 2002 to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s Golden Jubilee and previously known as The Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service (QAVS) the Award has been shining a light on the fantastic work of voluntary groups from across the UK for many years. Equivalent to an MBE KAVS is the highest Award given to local voluntary groups in the UK and they are awarded for life.

Established in 1979 Carmarthen and District Youth Opera has been a cornerstone of the performing arts community in Wales for over four decades. What began as a small group of dedicated individuals at Carmarthen’s Further Education Centre youth club has flourished into one of Wales’s most successful cultural societies thanks to the dedication of volunteers.

Under the leadership of the late Elizabeth Evans MBE and her husband David Carmarthen and District Youth Opera has grown from strength to strength showcasing high-quality musical entertainment and earning accolades such as the Lord Snowdon Award for its first annual music production of “Snow White” in 1979. Over the years Carmarthen and District Youth Opera has continued to captivate audiences with productions ranging from “Oliver” to “Jesus Christ Superstar” garnering national praise.

Further major Lyric refurbishment works in the early 1990’s and later gave a home to the Youth Opera with a venue and facilities in which it could deliver productions of the highest quality to an audience of approximately 500 people. For a period of 15 years it functioned as an entertainment centre run voluntarily by the Lyric Trust drawn from the Youth Opera’s supporters. The theatre is since owned and run by Carmarthenshire County Council as a venue for current and future generations.

Carmarthen and District Youth Opera’s impact extends beyond the stage with many former cast members pursuing successful careers in music and dramatic arts. The organisation’s commitment to excellence and inclusivity has earned it widespread recognition including from Her Majesty the Queen the Emir of Qatar and their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall.

As Carmarthen and District Youth Opera celebrates this prestigious award it remains firm in its commitment to nurturing young talent and enriching the cultural landscape of Wales.

Councillor Hazel Evans Cabinet Member for Regeneration Leisure Culture & Tourism said: “Carmarthen and District Youth Opera embodies the spirit of community and dedication to the arts that enriches our region. Receiving the King’s Award for Voluntary Services is a testament to the unwavering commitment of its volunteers and the profound impact the organisation has on nurturing young talent. We are proud to celebrate their achievements and look forward to their continued contributions to the cultural vibrancy of West Wales.”",,,,,,,,,

La venta de la cadena Fox Sports no se ha cerrado de acuerdo a fuentes de Mediapro cadena española que también busca la adquisición de la señal deportiva contrario a lo que anunció Grupo Lauhman dueño del periódico El Financiero.

De acuerdo a información recabada por el diario Milenio el Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT) no ha dado una resolución definitiva ya que apenas el 18 de mayo envió una solicitud de información a Mediapro ""como parte del su análisis de su propuesta"" imponiendo un plazo que finalizará el próximo martes por lo que no se puede anunciar que las negociaciones ya se hayan cerrado.

“No tendría ningún sentido que se considerase a Mediapro fuera del proceso cuando el IFT todavía no ha recibido toda la información que el propio Instituto ha requerido y su plazo de entrega termina hasta el próximo martes” explicó la fuente al mencionado diario.



El viernes en su espacio de El Financiero Bloomberg el periodista Guillermo Ortega explicó que ""Grupo Lauman empresa presidida por Manuel Arroyo y propietaria de El Financiero confirma la adquisición de Fox Sports México operación sujeta a autorizaciones de los reguladores de nuestro país"" con la promesa de que en los próximos días se darían a conocer más detalles.

Un largo proceso

En marzo de 2019 The Walt Disney Company anunció la compra de 21st Century Fox aunque e IFT pidió que Fox Sports fuera vendida a terceros para evitar prácticas monopólicas ya que la empresa del ratón Mickey ya opera la señal deportiva de ESPN en el país.

En el hipotético caso de que prevaleciera Disney con ambas señales deportivas concentraría el 80 por ciento de la transmisión de eventos deportivos en el país entre ellos Champions League Europa League Liga MX MLB y NFL.

Baillères ),"Por Guillermo Leal

Uno de los orgullos de la ganadería mexicana llega hoy de la mano de San Miguel de Mimiahuápam.

Hace medio siglo por primera vez seis toros nacidos en México fueron lidiados en Las Ventas de Madrid.

Además de las emociones y triunfos fue una tarde en la que iniciaba así la internacionalización de la divisa morado y amarillo.

Aquel hito histórico se logró con su criador Luis Barroso Barona quien en 1948 fundó la ganadería en Tlaxcala; hoy de la mano del ganadero y empresario Alberto Baillères se ha convertido en una de las vacadas más importantes de la cabaña brava mexicana.

Y de la de su hijo Juan Pablo apasionado criador recuerda esta efeméride suscitado hace 50 años justo hoy por día y por fecha: sábado 22 de mayo de 1971 cuando Victoriano Valencia –después con estrechos vínculos con México- el valiente acapulqueño Antonio Lomelín –triunfador al cortar una oreja pese a que le negaron otra-; y José Luis Parada lidiaron el encierro en el ruedo venteño.

“Celebrar 50 años del debut de la ganadería de San Miguel de Mimiahuápam en la plaza de Las Ventas de Madrid el 22 de mayo de 1971 es algo que está grabado en la historia de la ganadería brava mexicana y en la historia de la tauromaquia. Este debut se llevó a cabo de la mano de su entonces propietario Luis Barroso Barona y fue una gran hazaña ya que no fue tarea fácil por la logística de enviar el encierro por barco y el riesgo que esto conlleva” asegura Juan Pablo.

No fue una travesía fácil. Bueno nada fue fácil como lo cuenta el ganadero guanajuatense. “El plan inicial consistía en navegar de Veracruz al puerto de Cádiz; sin embargo al no haber carga suficiente la naviera cambió a último momento el plan de navegación hacía Colombia; luego a Venezuela y finalmente a Santander por lo que el trayecto duró un mes en vez de unos cuantos días».

“Los toros iban en cómodos cajones y era necesario darles un baño diario para su confort y disminuir el estrés además de proporcionarles alimento. A pesar de que se cuidaron todos los detalles redujeron significativamente el peso al haberse prolongado el trayecto por lo que hubo que esperar un año para su lidia con la finalidad de reponerlos y aclimatarlos con el riesgo de que algo les pudiera pasar desde una enfermedad hasta una pelea que pasa muy a menudo en el campo y donde llegan a matarse entre ellos mismos».

“Inclusive de los ocho toros que viajaron uno falleció en la Finca Los Alburejos propiedad del ganadero Álvaro Domecq y Diez en Andalucía donde los toros estuvieron recuperándose. Estamos hablando que es otro clima otra tierra otra alimentación y otra agua muy distinta a la que se tenía en Tlaxcala lugar donde en aquellas épocas pastaban los toros de Mimiahuápam».

“Todos estos factores no incidieron en el notable juego que dio la corrida en la plaza. Se lidiaron animales con cinco años cumplidos y los seis toros dieron un emocionante juego destacando por su bravura movilidad y buen estilo. Sobresalió el extraordinario toro 33 lidiado en cuarto lugar de nombre «Amistoso» y que fue premiado con la vuelta al ruedo”.

A propósito que el toro que no se lidió (“Compadre” número 45) se quedó en la Torrestrella ganadería de Don Álvaro y dejó muy buena descendencia” recordó Juan Pablo quien es ahora el que se encarga de la dirección de la ganadería siempre apoyado por su padre.Las familias Baillères y Barroso llevaban una buena relación sobre todo don Alberto y don Luis por lo que no fue difícil que en 1972 cambiara de propietario.

“Mi padre tuvo una muy buena relación con don Luis y le compró la ganadería al año siguiente en 1972 y la trasladó al Rancho Begoña en el estado de Guanajuato donde tenía ya su otra ganadería precisamente la de Begoña”.

En México Mimiahuápam tiene una historia triunfal llena de galardones y de páginas completas en las que se relatan las inolvidables faenas de figuras del toreo quienes han tenido la fortuna de disfrutar de la clase y bravura de los toros nacidos en esas casa.

Pero en el extranjero según lo cuenta Juan Pablo no sólo fue Madrid sino Sudamérica en donde San Miguel de Mimiahuápam goza de muy buen cartel.

“La ganadería ha lidiado encierros en la Santa María de Bogotá en Colombia; en la Plaza de Cañaveralejo durante la Feria de Cali también en Colombia; y en la Feria del Sol de Mérida en Venezuela con la gran fortuna de traernos los trofeos al mejor encierro de la temporada de estas tres grandes plazas sudamericanas”.

Desde “Coquetón” en la Plaza México primer toro al que le cortan un rabo ya siendo don Alberto Baillères propietario tras una grandiosa faena de Eloy Cavazos quien por cierto debutó dos días antes el 20 de mayo de 1971 en Las Ventas hay una serie de nombres que le han dado lustre a tan insigne hierro.

“Tenemos gratos recuerdos de faenas y toros inmortalizados. Por citar algunos recuerdo uno de nombre ‘Ejemplar’ para ‘Morante de la Puebla’ en Aguascalientes».

“La despedida de México del maestro colombiano Cesar Rincón quien está cumpliendo 30 años de sus históricas puertas grandes en Madrid con ‘Siete Puertas’ precisamente lidiado en la Plaza Nuevo Progreso de Guadalajara. El indulto que logró el francés Sebastián Castella al toro ‘Amor Lindo’ en Aguascalientes; el triunfo del peruano Roca Rey con ‘Bendecido’ en la Plaza de La Luz de León».

“El toro ‘Valeroso’ que recibió arrastre lento también en Guadalajara lidiado por Juan Pablo Sánchez que le cortó dos orejas».

“En el año del 2019 tuvimos muchos triunfos ya que vivimos con mucha emoción tres indultos: el de Diego Silveti a ‘Tequila’ en Autlán de la Grana; el de Arturo Saldívar al toro ‘Amor Infinito’ en Aguascalientes que nos permitió llevarnos el trofeo al mejor toro de la feria; y el toro ‘Mixiote’ que indultó José Mauricio en Huamantla Tlaxcala.

Justo hace un mes lidiamos una corrida en Aguascalientes a beneficio de las agrupaciones taurinas que fue un éxito rotundo” recordó Juan Pablo Baillères.

Y a propósito en esa tarde inolvidable en Aguascalientes triunfó la fiesta sobre todo muy aparte del éxito de los toreros que de suyo vale su peso en oro.

Esta fiesta brava que en México se está reactivando una fiesta que en gran parte del País y en la propia capital no se entendería ahora sin el apoyo de la familia Baillères.

“La de Aguascalientes fue una tarde soñada en la que embistieron todos los toros y donde pudimos disfrutar grandes faenas».

“Además era especial para la familia ya que los nombres los pusimos en honor a mi adorado padre. Una pena que los toreros no estuvieran finos con la espada ya que teníamos que haber salido todos a hombros. Tres toros se llevaron honores: uno de nombre ‘Señor de Señores’ recibió arrastre lento ‘Siempre Amoroso’ fue de vuelta al ruedo y ‘Grandioso Ser’ fue indultado por Leo Valadez. Tuve la fortuna de dar una muy emotiva vuelta al ruedo en representación de mi padre y salir a hombros de los aficionados junto con Valadez.»

“Fue un día muy especial donde la gente salió toreando de la plaza de las tardes que marcan historia de las que hacen afición y lo más importante es que se pudieron reactivar las corridas de toros en una plaza de primera después de la pandemia y que fue en beneficio de las agrupaciones taurinas en México” contó.

Corto es el tiempo y el espacio para hablar de lo que representa la ganadería de San Miguel de Mimiahuápam en la historia mundial del toreo. Por lo pronto hoy 22 de mayo de 2021 se celebran los primeros 50 años de un hecho que no podía pasar desapercibido.

Aquella tarde Victoriano Valencia el mexicano Antonio Lomelín y José Luis Parada dieron cuenta de los toros de Mimiahuápam.

1.- 21 “Hermano”.

Valencia (al tercio)

2.- 22 “Cariñoso”.

Lomelín (una oreja)

3.- 14 “Manito”.

Parada (silencio)

4.- 33 “Amistoso” *.

5.- 58 “Cuate”.

Verizon Media New York City NY

May 19 2021

Verizon Media 770 Broadway Manhattan

Architect / Interiors: Perkins+Will ; Broadcast Production Studio Architect: Kostow Greenwood Architects

Location: 770 Broadway New York City NY USA

Size: 21700 square feet

Overview

Verizon Media a division of Verizon Communications Inc. houses a trusted ecosystem of digital brands like Yahoo TechCrunch HuffPost RYOT and MAKERS that help people stay informed and entertained communicate and transact. From XR experiences to advertising and content technology Verizon Media is an incubator of innovation and is leading the charge on the next generation of content creation in a 5G world.

This workplace and broadcast production studio project coincided with the formation of Verizon Media and the primary project directive was to create a signature facility that could foster connection and collaboration across brands.

The photographs represent a pre-pandemic work environment and are not representative of current protocols. The original design intention incorporated flexibility which will allow Verizon Media to adapt to future needs.

Perkins+Will served as lead project designers and architect of record with Kostow Greenwood Architects as broadcast studio design architects. A principal aim shared by all was to highlight the broadcast production activity and spaces for both staff and visitors.

At the Reception Hub the spatial design encourages the intersection of environments and activities. Here open lounge seating and live broadcast production exist side-by-side for visual interaction. As a media company this confluence of atmospheres reflects the varying modes and dynamism of Verizon Media’s work:



The design purposely breaks down the hierarchy of individual spaces allowing for movement through the hallways and breakout rooms and providing an array of accessible workspaces. The Reception Hub and Control Room 1 were carefully calibrated to balance contrasting work environments. The new reception hub serves as both a gateway for visitors and lounge-like workstation for staff meetings off camera interviews and editing while offering clear site lines into the control room:



Design Challenges

1. A new company & executive organization

2. Differing brands teams and broadcast production requirements

3. Lack of connection between production areas and the rest of the facility

4. Design process was simultaneous to staff restacking and consolidation efforts

5. Need to maintain operations in and around work area for elevator access and continuous broadcast production in Studio A

A principal goal shared by all was to highlight the broadcast production activity and spaces for both staff and visitors. This aim was a direct challenge to the inherent nature of production spaces which require acoustic and visual isolation to maximize the workspace.

Throughout the design process the client continued to consolidate staff and productions to a single location. This greatly influenced scope and costs and required the project to respond to broader restacking efforts and facility planning. Also during the design phase the client was in negotiations with the building landlord to rededicate building elevators and lobby entrances.

Through construction over half of the floor would still need to function as a typical workplace along with support spaces for pantry and food catering needs. In addition select broadcast spaces like Studio A and Green Rooms needed to continue operations and production through construction.

The configuration of the Reception Hub and Control Room 1 were carefully considered to balance contrasting work environments. As Control Room 1 is a glass-enclosed space visual contrast and sound transmission was controlled by variable light settings and acoustical treatment in the Control Room. An applied film with gradient opacity helps provide privacy for broadcast operators within the room:



Studio A received multiple upgrades to prepare for Yahoo Finance which expanded to full-time production while relocating from another Verizon Media property. New broadcast hardware LED lighting and controls advanced the production capabilities for current and future programming while a new custom set maximized the possible shooting angles by utilizing all four corners of the room:



Design Solutions

1. Create a new signature space that exemplifies the company ethos and exudes a unifying aesthetic for all brands

2. Design process and communication fostered collaboration across company brands and teams to develop shared goals and project scope

3. Emphasize the content creation and production activity as a part of the viewing experience by offering a visible connection between broadcast control rooms and the reception hub area

4. Expand on existing infrastructure and production spaces

5. Keep origin of infrastructure (rack room risers etc.) to reduce costs but reorganized major pathways for technical and equipment upgrades and anticipated future use.

6. Develop a phasing plan and a precise temporary protection plan for access and operations that needed to continue through construction.

The new reception hub serves as the main reception for Verizon Media offices. It is a destination for both staff and visitors offering open lounges for working and waiting. The entry area features a branded media wall that can display a varied amount of programming. The space is particularly special by inviting viewers to see the production activity inside Control Room 1 and Master Control.

Each Control Room has a dedicated Audio Booth providing multiple positions with visual connectivity to the Control Room and Reception Hub beyond:



In contrast to Studio A Studio B was outfitted for flexible programming and is expected to support varying brands and content. The studio received new broadcast hardware LED lighting and controls to advance technical capabilities. An existing truss grid was expanded to optimize shooting angles at multiple corners. The former glass-enclosed studio received new acoustically treated partitions and wall treatment for improved sound isolation along with a new raised floor system:



Control Room #2 and its surrounding corridor is playfully refreshed with a dynamic wall treatment bringing a new energy and vibrance to the work environment:



The reimagined broadcast production studio provides a physical platform where all brands can produce media content. There was a forward-looking effort to sustain all existing programming while providing capabilities for future growth. Multiple studios control rooms and plug-and-play locations provide flexible shooting opportunities and respond to different production needs. Production will encompass live broadcast and pre-tape studio content with shared resources across different locations. Control Room 1 and Control Room 3 are used for a daily eight-hour live Yahoo! Finance broadcast and ancillary shoots. Control Room 2 is a general-purpose studio for other company brands.

The final design kept critical elements that were available for reuse. Studio A and Control Room 2 with Audio Booth were reimagined and improved to receive new finishes along with upgraded hardware and equipment. Studio A was a priority for preservation since it is column-free space and acoustically isolated to high broadcast standards. Studio B was the site of an existing glass studio.

The glass partitions were removed and saved for reuse at other glazed locations and the studio was enclosed with new solid acoustic partitions. Both studios received new LED theatrical lighting and controls and Studio A was outfitted with a new custom set for Yahoo! Finance.

Control Rooms 1 and 3 were newly construction and were planned to accommodate a high number of positions with some room for additional seating. These rooms also incorporate in-room Audio Booths to maximize production workflow. The rooms are outfitted with new broadcast equipment consoles and monitor walls.

An increase in edit rooms was possible by reusing existing offices and enclosing ancillary spaces bringing the total to twelve. The edit rooms received new fabric wrapped acoustic panels along with new broadcast consoles & monitors.

Additional production support was consolidated into the space including multiple green rooms for talent graphics suite and huddle rooms. The open concept extends throughout the environment to ease movement and workflow:



The entry into the Broadcast Suite highlights activity in the Master Control Room while providing immediate access to the main workflow circulation. In addition to standard master control functions it is also equipped to act as a remote control room for any studio or off-site production. New cable tray infrastructure was installed throughout. As an exposed pathway they provided easy access during broadcast integration and will remain easily accessible for any future upgrades or changes:



The orientation and organization of Control Room 1 is formed to be a feature element of the main Reception Hub. Monitors and consoles are placed in a standard hierarchy for production workflow but are oriented so that reception guests and viewers can witness the action:



In order to support the consolidation of production from other facility locations this location required an increase and expansion of the infrastructure. A new rack room was constructed in the existing location. This helped to reduce costs by maintaining critical existing pathways but allowed an increase in size and an upgrade in equipment and HVAC system.

A new cable tray network was also installed throughout the broadcast area. As an exposed pathway it provided easy access during broadcast integration and will provide ease of access for any future upgrades or changes.

It’s common for rugged phones to feature older processors and lack modern features — these phones often have specialized uses like barcode scanning or taking payments and more or less just need to keep working in harsh environments.

The DuraForce Ultra 5G includes both the durability of a rugged phone and modern features like 5G wireless charging a high-quality processor and dual rear cameras. At $899 it’s an expensive phone — you can buy a very nice non-rugged phone for that much — but if durability is a must and you don’t want to sacrifice performance or convenient features the DuraForce 5G is (quite literally) a solid choice.

Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G rugged features

Pick up the DuraForce Ultra 5G and you’ll know right away that you have a rugged device in your hands. The top and bottom of the phone are wrapped in thick plastic bumpers the sides feature a texturized finish and at 278g (9.8oz) it’s much heavier than your standard smartphone. The screen itself isn’t very big — just a 5.45-inch 1080p LCD panel — but the sizable bezels and thick chin make it a chunky device overall.

Despite its dimensions it’s actually easy to use one-handed since the screen itself is relatively small. The phone will fit in a jacket pocket but it’s too bulky for any of my jeans pockets. Haptics are aggressive even at the “medium” default setting which is a good thing in a phone you might be using with gloves. Otherwise you can turn touch vibrations down to low or off.

The phone is both IP65 and IP68 rated meaning there’s generous protection against water intrusion both from jets and immersion (up to 6.5 feet for up to 30 minutes). The DuraForce Ultra 5G meets the Military Standard 810H specifications and includes protection against vibration blowing dust and sand extreme temperatures drops from five feet onto concrete high altitudes and plenty of other hostile conditions.

Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine

I couldn’t test it against all of those conditions but I did subject the phone to plenty of abuse including an hourlong stay in the freezer water immersion for 30 minutes in the kitchen sink exposure to sand and a drop from about five feet onto driveway asphalt. Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine. Kyocera does include a two-year warranty with purchase so as long as you use the phone within the conditions it’s rated to withstand you shouldn’t be putting your purchase at risk.

In addition to rugged features the DuraForce Ultra 5G is just loaded with buttons. There’s a power button with embedded fingerprint sensor three programmable keys and a large volume rocker that’s easy to press with gloves on. I frequently pressed one of the programmable buttons accidentally when I grabbed the phone — they’re in easy reach when you’re using the phone but that unfortunately means a lot of unintentional presses too. These buttons do require a long press to bring up whatever shortcut function you’ve assigned to them so a brief press won’t do anything. You can also assign any of them to “do nothing” when pressed if you’d rather not use them.

Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G screen performance and battery

Aside from the obvious difference in appearance and ergonomics the DuraForce Ultra 5G handles pretty much the way any other Android device does. The screen looks a little low on contrast in comparison to your standard display — likely because the panel is optimized for viewability in bright sunlight. That’s probably more important to the phone’s target user than a rich multimedia viewing experience and the panel is indeed usable even in very bright direct light.

The screen’s protective “Sapphire Shield” remained free of scratches during my testing but it does pick up reflections easily outside more so than other phones with Gorilla Glass. It wasn’t enough to bother me but someone planning to use the phone outside in bright light often might find it distracting.

The DuraForce Ultra 5G ships with Android 10; Kyocera says it will provide an update to 11 but that the timeframe is still being determined. Android 10 is fine for now but given that Google is readying Android 12 for the public it’s definitely a step behind. Kyocera says it will provide a minimum of two years of security updates which is a common if not terribly generous policy.

This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum

The DuraForce Ultra 5G uses a Snapdragon 765G processor with 6GB RAM which puts overall performance on par with a midrange phone. There’s some slight stuttering when scrolling quickly through screens with lots of images and video and a noticeable pause after taking a photo in the camera app but other than that it keeps up well — especially considering the lower performance bar in the rugged class.

There’s a 4500mAh battery built into the DuraForce Ultra 5G. It’s a comparatively large battery for the class and it got me through a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports Qi wireless charging which is uncommon among rugged phones. The phone was a little finicky on my stand-style Belkin wireless charger but it eventually worked when set on the charger in landscape orientation.

And of course there’s one of the DuraForce Ultra 5G’s namesake features: 5G. This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum (also called Ultra Wideband by Verizon hence the UW in the phone’s name). It’s only sold through Verizon in the US which makes sense: the company has been pushing mmWave much harder than the other major carriers and does offer more coverage though it’s still relatively scarce. Verizon’s 5G network is kind of lackluster overall at this point though it will improve over the next couple of years. It’s a good feature to have on a phone you’re going to hang onto for a while but definitely don’t buy this (or any phone really) just for mmWave since you’ll probably have a hard time finding a signal anyway.

Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G camera

The DuraForce Ultra’s rear camera array consists of a 24-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide and a 16-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide plus a time-of-flight sensor. Around front there’s an 8-megapixel f/2.0 selfie camera. That’s a cut above what’s offered on many rugged phones. Picture-taking likely isn’t a high priority for prospective DuraForce Ultra owners and image quality is certainly not up to what you’d find on conventional $900 phones but it does the job.

Photos in good light look fine if a bit on the low-contrast washed-out side. Exposure and color can shift noticeably between two images taken with the same camera at slightly different angles and I noticed some odd misses here and there like a blurry shot of a static subject where it looked like the camera had tried to apply too much HDR. But most of the time in bright light photos are perfectly fine and a cut above what I’d expect from a rugged phone.

There’s also a mode that will overlay live information on your still image or video about whatever extreme situation you happen to be in including location altitude speed and G-force. Extreme activities are generally not recommended in your second trimester of pregnancy so I didn’t really test this out. I imagine if you’re into something like mountain biking or climbing and you want to record that kind of information with your activity you probably have a better way of doing so already. In any case it’s there and it’s definitely more of a casual fun feature than it is practical.

If you’re merely curious about living a rugged phone lifestyle the DuraForce Ultra 5G isn’t for you. The phone’s extremely hardy specifications would be appealing to anyone who’s nervous about dropping their phone or occasionally brings their phone to rough environments like beaches or backcountry camping. If that’s you spend your $900 on a good standard phone (many are IP68 rated) and a rugged case. You’ll get better performance a better camera timelier software updates — basically a lot more for the money.

The inclusion of 5G wireless charging and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site

If you need a rugged phone on the job as a frontline worker first responder or construction worker for example then the DuraForce Ultra 5G makes a lot more sense — especially if it’s going to be your primary phone off the job and you’d really like some extra bells and whistles. The inclusion of 5G wireless charging and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site.

However $900 is an awful lot to spend on a phone and I think that very specific kind of customer for this phone is a pretty small group. You could buy a less expensive rugged phone with more limited functionality like Kyocera’s own DuraForce model from last year and a darn good midrange phone for around the same price. You probably can’t get mmWave 5G that way but that’s no great loss.

Still the DuraForce Ultra 5G represents a convenient option for a particular type of person if two phones feels like too much fuss. It certainly handled everything I threw it at and functioned well as a daily companion for more pedestrian tasks like scrolling social media and navigating trips across town. If extreme durability is a must and you don’t want to give up too much to get it then the DuraForce Ultra 5G is a good choice.

However have you ever given a thought that there maybe certain applications which maybe draining your phone’s energy even when you are not using them because let’s be honest how many times has it happened that you charged your phone kept it aside and when you came back after a few hours busy with the work at home or somewhere you see your battery drop by a few percent.To look through this problem a phone storage application company called pCloud analyzed app permissions to check which of your applications drain the most battery despite not being used and came up with astonishing results.The method they used to find which applications suck the battery out of your phone was that analyzed and checked which functions the apps used (such as location or camera) how much battery power those require and whether the apps in question have a dark-mode setting and through this concluded what were the top applications using your battery the most.From the data researchers found that Fitbit Facebook Instagram Skype Uber and Verizon were among the top 10 applications responsible for drinking up your battery.The phone storage company also found that social media and dating applications were the two main factors which were found guilty of draining your phone’s battery. The famous socializing applications known as Facebook Instagram LinkedIn Snapchat YouTube and WhatsApp were found to be in the top 20 list of battery drainers and it was also observed that these applications permit 11 features to run in the background even when not being used.Bumble Grindr and Tinder were the dating websites which accounted for 15 percent of battery being used and it was clear that dating applications exhaust your phone similar to how online dating exhausts you because they also let 11 features run in the background while you swipe on potential matches.However everyone has different applications on their phone and in case you don’t have many of the above mentioned applications on your phone but are still tired of your phone running out of battery you can check which apps suck your battery by just a few steps. All you will have to do is go to settings select on battery and look at battery usage by app.Read next: The CEOs across the world reveals that they are speculating that digital transformation AI technology and corporate engagement will stimulate a huge economic growth in 2021,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9tb3Rvcm9sYV9vbmVfYWN0aW9uX2FuZHJvaWRfMTFfdXBkYXRlLW5ld3MtNDkyNTkucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motorola One Action starts receiving Android 11 update,"The Motorola One Action launched in 2019 with Android 9 Pie was upgraded to Android 10 and is now receiving the Android 11 update.

Kuphall Maintains Lead At Bassmaster Elite Series Event On Lake Guntersville

SCOTTSBORO Ala. — On Thursday Caleb Kuphall said he was concerned he’d exhausted his Day 1 hot spot but the area still held enough quality fish to help him maintain his lead at the Berkley Bassmaster Elite at Lake Guntersville with a two-day total of 43 pounds 4 ounces.

Sacking up a Day 1 limit of 27-10 — the tournament’s biggest bag so far — the pro from Mukwonago Wis. carried a lead of 6-7 into Friday’s competition. Adding 15-10 Kuphall heads into Saturday’s semifinal round with a 4-9 margin over Canadian Chris Johnston.

Starting both days on a large milfoil bed not far from takeoff Kuphall has done most of his work in a relatively small area within this sprawling habitat. Other boats were fishing around him but Kuphall has dialed in a particular sweet spot.

“There’s a lot of pressure in that spot; today there was another two boats in there and another one came in later on” Kuphall said. “There’s still a lot of fish there; I got bit pretty much up until I left around 9:30. I just don’t think I can get another two days out of it.”

Kuphall is catching his bass on a Zoom Z-Hog in the California 420 color. He’s rigging the bait on a 4/0 extra-wide gap hook with a 3/4-ounce tungsten weight.

Once his starting spot fizzled Kuphall ran about 15 minutes uplake to fish a matted milfoil bed. This area holds scattered pads but he said the secondary habitat isn’t factoring into his game plan.

“You have the mat line and what I’m fishing is out from that” he said. “It’s a little deeper water and the isolated grass clumps are key to getting my bites. I really haven’t gotten any bites fishing the line.

“I’m using the Z-Hog here too but I’m using a 1-ounce weight. If the wind blows again tomorrow I may have to go to an ounce and a quarter or an ounce and a half.”

On Day 1 Kuphall’s second spot yielded two sizable culls but on Friday it afforded only a 1/4-pound upgrade. He noted that Friday’s wind impeded his efficiency on his uplake area.

“The wind was coming right up the gut and I had my trolling motor on 80 to 100% just to hold in that area” he said. “When you’re shallow like that in the mats I think I was spooking a lot of fish before I was getting to them.”

Assessing his day Kuphall said he’s pleased with his position but thankful for a huge first round which buoyed his weight. Overall Friday proved considerably more challenging.

“One of my areas is drying up on me and the other one … I just didn’t catch them today” he said. “I think I’m going to have to look for something else to do because I don’t see that first spot holding up another two days.

“It was a grind today. I only caught about 10 fish today. I was hoping I’d get some bigger bites but I didn’t get them. But tomorrow’s another day.”

Kuphall said he plans on giving his starting spot another look Saturday but he won’t burn much time there unless he finds a big bite early.

“I have a couple of other areas that I haven’t touched yet” he said. “They’re (mostly) keeper areas; just limit areas. If I get into trouble I can go and get a couple of bites.”

Hailing from Peterborough Ontario Johnston added 19-10 to the 19-1 he caught Thursday and gained three spots from fifth with a total weight of 38-11.

Johnston caught three of his limit fish by throwing a bream-colored Spro Poppin’ Frog over pads. He caught the other two while fishing a drop shot with a Roboworm in the morning dawn color over an offshore hard spot in about 10 feet.

“I didn’t go to my frog area on Day 1 because I had two 3-pounders blow up on it in practice and I was saving it in case I needed it” Johnston said. “Luckily it worked out today and there were more fish there than I thought. I wasn’t expecting to get those big ones and that many.”

Luke Palmer of Coalgate Okla. is in third with 37-3. After placing eighth on Day 1 with 17-12 Palmer added a limit of 19-7 which included a 5 1/2-pounder.

Palmer divided his day between throwing a Zara Spook in shallow water and rotating through a drop shot jerkbait and rattlebait in deeper grass.

“I’m just mixing it up and trying to figure out what the fish want” Palmer said. “You’re liable to go down one stretch turn around and come back with another bait and just wreck them.”

Caleb Sumrall of New Iberia La. is in the lead for Phoenix Boats Big Bass honors with his 7-6.

Seth Feider of New Market Minn. leads the Bassmaster Angler of the Year standings with 612 points. Brandon Palaniuk of Rathdrum Idaho is in second with 557 followed by Jason Christie of Park Hill Okla. with 554 Johnston with 548 and Patrick Walters of Summerville S.C. with 541.

Bryan New of Belmont N.C. leads the Rookie of the Year standings with 463 points.

Saturday’s takeoff is scheduled for 5:30 a.m. CT from Scottsboro’s Goose Pond Colony Resort Marina. The weigh-in will be held back at Goose Pond at 2 p.m. After Saturday’s weigh-in only the Top 10 remaining anglers will advance to Championship Sunday with a chance at the $100000 first-place prize.

Live coverage of the event can be streamed on Bassmaster.com and the FOX Sports digital platforms. FS1 will also broadcast the action live with the leaders beginning at 7 a.m.

The tournament is being hosted by the City of Scottsboro.

The Mohave County Sheriff's Office said the incident happened on Wednesday at around 5:30 p.m.

Officials with multiple area law enforcement agencies responded to the Walmart located near Highway 95 and Hammer Lane for a shooting.

Authorities said the rider of a motorcycle later identified as 23-year-old Jim Mosier of Bullhead City was reportedly driving recklessly along Highway 95.

The driver of another vehicle identified as 41-year-old Larry Marcum of Bullhead City noticed Mosier pull into the front of the Walmart and parked.

Authorities said Marcum confronted Mosier about his driving and began to argue in front of the store when Mosier allegedly pulled out a handgun to his side.

During the argument Marcum also pulled out a handgun and held it to his side but eventually placed it back into his pocket.

After a short time Marcum who was not armed reportedly went to kick Mosier who then shot Marcum in the chest.

Authorities said Marcum fell to the floor and Mosier then called 911.

Marcum was taken to a local hospital where he later died.

Following witness interviews and video surveillance review authorities arrested Mosier for second-degree murder.

MCSO officials say the investigation remains ongoing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9yZWNhbGwtYWxlcnQtbG9jYWwvbmVhcmx5LTgwMGstZm9sZGluZy1jaGFpcnMtc29sZC1hdC13YWxtYXJ0LXJlY2FsbGVkLzI2MzkxMzIv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjZGZ3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3JlY2FsbC1hbGVydC1sb2NhbC9uZWFybHktODAway1mb2xkaW5nLWNoYWlycy1zb2xkLWF0LXdhbG1hcnQtcmVjYWxsZWQvMjYzOTEzMi8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 800K Folding Chairs Sold at Walmart Recalled,"Nearly 800000 folding chairs sold at Walmart stores nationwide have been recalled due to reports of the product breaking and causing a falling hazard according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

SWANSEA — While the recent inter-municipal sewer agreement between Swansea and Somerset has the potential to revitalize Route 6 Swansea continues to work with developers to bring the area of the old Swansea Mall back to life.

Swansea Selectman Chris Carreiro said developers estimate that they will spend approximately $200 million between redevelopment of the actual mall as well as constructing market rate apartments that will be built on pad sites on the Swansea Mall property.

Carreiro approximated that there will be between 144-150 units constructed on the land with hopes that it will help “feed the businesses in the mall.”

“One project makes the other project successful” Carreiro said.

Carreiro pointed to the Burger King that closed on Route 6 as an example.

They closed Carreiro said “because the market conditions were not advantageous for that business to be successful.” He believes that there “has been a material change in circumstances” that's enticing to Burger King to return.

Because of the work of the Swansea Mall Redevelopment Project Carreiro was “contacted by one of the districts and regional managers” of the fast-food chain in order to “find out more information about the Swansea Mall and the project before they committed to coming back.”

Susan Nedar chairperson of the Swansea Redevelopment Authority said that they are currently working with Bristol County Economic Development Consultants regarding research and paperwork as well as with Lincoln Property Co which will help appraise the property or easements covenants and restrictions (ECRs) at accurate market value.

However since the SRA is approaching litigation Nedar was limited in the detail she could share. The SRA is concentrated on their “preparation of the eminent domain takings of the ECR’s that Walmart has placed on that property.”

The fight for eminent domain over the ECRs started when the initial restrictions enacted “were no longer feasible” when development planning focused on the creation of a “lifestyle center” Nedar said.

The litigation is necessary Nedar said for the development to move forward. She expects that they will begin court proceedings “at the outset eight weeks at the most.”

Nedar said that the SRA is entitled to eminent domain but it will be up to the judge to decide what the cost of it will be.

Nedar was adamant when speaking about possible repercussions to Swansea town officials board members and consultants.

“Whatever happens with litigation the town of Swansea the board consultants and all town officials are 100% indemnified from any court findings any lawsuits or anything like that. There is no risk to the town or the people of the board or the town officials” Nedar said.

The work has not paused waiting for litigation to take place. While Nedar said that the “meat and bones"" of it — the new businesses and new tenants — will have to wait until they file with the court there are certain parcels of that land that developers are free to work with that fall outside of the ECR’s.

Currently there is a state-of-the-art storage facility CubeSmart and a church that is completely functional. Nedar said that there is ongoing work on the “façade of the building” as well as “portioning off spaces on the inside.”

Marcus & Millichap Capital Corporation recently arranged a $7.05 million loan to refinance Walmart’s ground lease which is adjacent to the Swansea Mall Property. It is not clear though what impact this deal will have on the work of the Swansea Redevelopment Authority.

When asked Nedar said that she was not aware of this new development but was interested to learn more.

In a video captured by Instagram user tcg_grassi and shared by Twitter user bigcards30 around a dozen or more people can be seen rushing through the entrance of a Walmart the moment the doors were unlocked at 7 am. They were there to buy up the newly stocked Pokémon cards.

Kotaku reached out to tcg_grassi and received permission to share the video.

tcg_grassi told Kotaku that this mad rush of people isn’t normally how these things go down. They blame the wild rush on a few folks who began running leading to more folks running and the eventual Pokémon stampede seen in the video.

“ I’ve been in lines at other stores with them and they’ve all been respectful in the past. Kinda crazy” said tcg_grassi.

The ongoing Pokémon card situation has led to single cards being sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It’s also led to shortages of Pokemon cards as The Pokémon Company can’t print cards fast enough to keep up with the demand. Earlier this month in response to the growing crowds shoving and assholes Target stopped selling Pokémon cards in-store.

According to tcg_grassi the manager working the morning shift at the Walmart was “annoyed” by the commotion and running. “The [other employees] looked fairly shocked.”

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjdXIub3JnL2hpc3RvcnkvMjAyMS0wNS0yMi93YWx0LWRpc25leS1kaWRudC1hY3R1YWxseS1kcmF3LW1pY2tleS1tb3VzZS1tZWV0LXRoZS1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1hcnRpc3Qtd2hvLWRpZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walt Disney didn't actually draw Mickey Mouse. Meet the Kansas City artist who did,"For more stories like this one subscribe to A People's History of Kansas City on Apple Podcasts Spotify or Stitcher.

Kansas City takes a lot of pride in being the place where Walt Disney started his first animation studio and created his first cartoon characters.

But here's the thing: Walt Disney didn’t design Mickey Mouse. And the stories he told for years about how the iconic character came to be aren’t true.

To know the truth about Mickey Mouse and the secret to many of Walt Disney’s successes you have to know the story of Disney's best friend: Kansas City animator Ub Iwerks. It was Iwerks not Disney who in 1928 designed Mickey Mouse and single-handedly animated the first Mickey cartoon in Hollywood.

The two originally met as teenagers while working at the same Kansas City commercial art studio. Unlike Disney Iwerks was born and raised in Kansas City. And from an early age Iwerks was fascinated with the idea of bringing still images to life. It was his dad a German immigrant who first introduced him to film.

In addition to being a prolific animator Iwerks was also the genius inventor behind Disney's greatest special effects. He is the one to thank for the iconic scenes in ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" in addition to Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds.""

“He was the person who was doing most of the behind-the-scenes work. And when Walt was taking credit Ub was the one who was denied credit” says Jeff Ryan author of “A Mouse Divided: How Ub Iwerks Became Forgotten and Walt Disney Became Uncle Walt.”

It’s not like Walt Disney wasn’t integral to the success of Mickey Mouse. He certainly was. In addition to defining Mickey’s personality he literally voiced the character for years. But that doesn’t erase the fact that for decades the collaboration between Iwerks and Disney was mostly kept a secret.

""I think a lot of that has to do with the way that Disney over the years has controlled the Mickey Mouse narrative"" Ryan says.

Plane Crazy (1928) / YouTube After a record 700 drawings a day Ub Iwerks animated the first Mickey Mouse cartoon single-handedly in two weeks something that would have taken other animators months.

You may have heard that Mickey was inspired by a pet mouse that Walt Disney had here in Kansas City at the Laugh-O-Gram Studio. Or that he came up the idea for Mickey on a train from New York to California. But most of these stories... are just stories.

“He said that it was not Walt creating the character on a train... So that was a very different story than the Disney company had put out or that Walt started telling after Mickey became successful” says Ub's granddaughter Leslie Iwerks.

The truth is that Mickey was born out of an extremely tense stressful moment. Walt Disney had just lost the rights to his first hit character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and all of his animators had abandoned him. Everyone except Oswald co-creator Ub Iwerks.

So while the departing animators finished up the final Oswald cartoon Disney and Iwerks worked behind a locked door to hastily sketch out a new character. In all honesty Mickey could have just as easily been a frog. Or a cow.

“Walt because he was never satisfied with anything kept on making up bigger and bigger whoppers to stretch the Mickey Mouse creation story"" Ryan says. ""And the biggest whopper at first was that Walt was the one who did it. He didn't do it.""

Bitterness over how little credit Iwerks got for co-creating Mickey Mouse is part of what almost tore the two friends apart for good. In 1930 Iwerks left Walt Disney Studios to start his own animation studio citing ""personal differences with Walt."" The two friends then spent the next decade locked in a rivalry.

But it wasn't the first storm the two friends weathered and it wouldn't be the last.

Walt Disney Archives Photo Library Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks in front of the Hyperion Avenue studio circa 1928.

After meeting as 18-year-olds in Kansas City in 1919 Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks went through a series of ill-conceived and failed business concepts before moving to Hollywood. Most notable was their work at the Laugh-O-Gram Studio at 1127 E. 31st St. which is currently being renovated by a Kansas City nonprofit.

“Ub Iwerks is equally as important here. He was a partner in that company. And I think this building is the story of Ub Iwerks as much as Walt Disney” says Butch Rigby the chairman of Thank You Walt Disney.

At the Laugh-O-Gram Studio Iwerks and Disney made short films for a movie house downtown in addition to ""Alice's Wonderland"" a live-action film starring 4-year-old Virginia Davis.

""It was a bunch of kids hanging out and making art"" Rigby says. ""The owners were Ub and Walt and they were 21 years old and they recruited these 18-year-olds with an ad in the paper that said 'If you'd like to draw cartoons come to the Laugh-O-Gram Studio.'""

Like Iwerks and Disney many of the early Laugh-O-Gram animators ended up in Hollywood and went on to become pioneers of American animation. Rudolf Ising and Hugh Harman were the early minds behind Warner Brothers Cartoons and MGM Cartoons.

LaBudde Special Collections at the University of Missouri – Kansas City / Kansas City Public Library In this staged shot on the roof of the Laugh-O-Gram building Walt Disney (left) holds a gun while Ub Iwerks (center) directs.

“Ub was quiet but a genius. And I mean literally a genius. And Walt recognized that” Rigby says.

Iwerks was an artistic and engineering whiz with the ability to creatively solve any problem. Disney meanwhile was a dazzling storyteller who knew how to get the best out of other people.

""When you put Walt and Ub together they were able to do just about anything"" Ryan says.

But part of the thrill for Iwerks was the chase. Once the problem was solved sometimes he lost interest.

""There is a famous story in animation circles about Ub Iwerks’ brief love of bowling"" Ryan says. ""He got better and better and better until one day he bowled 13 strikes in a row. And as soon as he did that he's like okay I've solved bowling. And he never bowled again.""

The same thing happened to Iwerks in the late 1930s. After two decades of animating the challenge for him was gone.

So in 1940 10 years after he left Walt Disney Studios as an animator Ub Iwerks returned as a special effects problem solver. According to Leslie Iwerks it was as though the rift with Disney had never happened. ""They immediately became tight again and trustworthy again.""

Walt Disney Archives Photo Library Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney in 1966 reminiscing over Mickey Mouse story sketches from 1929.

The two friends worked side by side until 1966 when Disney died at the age of 65. Ub Iwerks said Disney's death was ""the end of an era.""

Then in 1999 18 years after Ub Iwerks' death Walt Disney Pictures released Leslie Iwerks' feature-length documentary about her grandfather ""The Hand Behind the Mouse.""

""I just wanted to clear that history and I really wanted to also tell the story of Ub's contributions to Mickey Mouse"" she says.

So in a sense the Walt Disney company did eventually tell the true origin story of Mickey Mouse. It just took 70 years or so.

In the end the story of Mickey Mouse is a good reminder that everything is a team effort. Behind every powerful mouse there might be a Walt Disney. But behind every Walt Disney there’s probably at least one Ub Iwerks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvd2F0Y2gtbGl2ZS1kaXNuZXktY2hhaXJtYW4tYm9iLWlnZXItY29tbWVuY2VtZW50LXNwZWVjaC1hdC11dC1hdXN0aW4uaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzA1LzIyL3dhdGNoLWxpdmUtZGlzbmV5LWNoYWlybWFuLWJvYi1pZ2VyLWNvbW1lbmNlbWVudC1zcGVlY2gtYXQtdXQtYXVzdGluLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney executive chairman Bob Iger: 'Nearly every successful person that I know has struggled or failed',"Bob Iger executive chairman and former CEO of The Walt Disney Company delivered the commencement address at The University of Texas at Austin on Saturday.

In his speech Iger urged graduates to dream big and brush off naysayers early.

""[T]here just is no such thing as having dreams that are too big. Your possibilities are enormous"" Iger said.

He also encouraged graduates to embrace failure and setbacks along the way.

""Nearly every successful person that I know has struggled or failed at some point"" Iger said.

Iger pointed to Steve Jobs getting fired from Apple (the company he founded) and Walt Disney getting fired from one of his first jobs as a newspaper artist because ""he lacked imagination.""

""Walt failed a number of times over the years. However always the optimist he never stopped dreaming big and being bold"" he added.

And if your first dream doesn't come true Iger said ""find another one and pursue it with equal conviction.""

""I failed as a weatherman and then the guy I worked for told me I wasn't good enough to ever get the next job. Now fortunately he was wrong. I did get another job a promotion and the rest is history"" Iger said.

Iger advised graduates to speak up and speak the truth even when it is difficult for others to hear and to use technology ""to heal not to harm.""

""Be a force for good in our world because there is so much that needs fixing and along the way be sure to embrace life"" he said.

Iger served as CEO at Disney for 15 years before stepping down in February of 2020. During his tenure Iger was instrumental in turning Disney into a media powerhouse with several key acquisitions including Pixar Marvel and 21st Century Fox.

Despite amassing a fortune (that Forbes estimates is worth about $690 million) Iger 70 wasn't always part of the 1%; he had to start at the bottom according to his book ""The Ride of a Lifetime.""

Iger last visited The University of Texas when he spoke at the university's VIP Distinguished Speaker Series in 2018 the release said.

Iger Delivers Commencement Address at the University of Texas at Austin,"The following is the speech delivered by Robert A. Iger Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board at The Walt Disney Company during the 138th spring commencement at UT Austin May 22 2021.

Good evening! President Hartzell Chairman Eltife members of the faculty and staff parents and family members graduates. It is so great to be here all together in one place!

To the Class of 2021 congratulations! You got through a year of quarantines Zoom classes masks nasal swabs and more take-out food than you thought you’d eat in a lifetime—and you’re graduating! That’s cause for a big celebration under normal circumstances but this year’s commencement is even more special.

You know I’ve thought a lot about what I would say to all of you tonight which brought me back to my own commencement 48 years ago…. and I quickly realized I couldn’t remember who the speaker was—I actually think only about 6% of people can recall who spoke at their graduation!

Fortunately you all have phones with cameras so there’s a chance half a century from now you’ll look back at photos and remember that it was me who spoke to you.

While I don’t recall much about that day what I do remember is that as a young college graduate I had utterly no idea where my life would take me. I certainly never dreamed I would one day be asked to give a commencement address. So to President Hartzell and everyone here let me say ‘Thank you.’ It truly is an honor and a pleasure for me to stand on these hallowed Forty Acres and be a part of this special day.

I also didn’t know I was going to have four children one of whom is here graduating. His name is Max and he’s probably terribly embarrassed that I’m even mentioning him—but how could I not?!

I will simply say: he absolutely loved his time here at UT and he even has a bit of a Texas accent – which is a good thing for a kid from California! He received a phenomenal education. His mother and I are very thankful for that. And he’s made a number of really wonderful friends and I am certain they will remain connected for the rest of their lives. I’m also pleased to say that Max’s brother Will has decided to go to UT as well and so we’ll soon have two Longhorns in the family which we’re very excited about!

Today is and will always be one of those significant days in your life. In many ways it is an ending but it is also a beginning which probably feels a bit overwhelming for some of you.

There’s no doubt this is an extraordinary somewhat unsettling time to be a young person starting out. There are tough challenges at the global and community levels and no easy answers.

But it is an exciting time too.

Our world is changing at a faster pace than many thought possible. A lot has been disrupted but so much has been created. There are new industries new businesses new and different jobs and exciting places to find those jobs like right here in Austin. We are immersed in invention and innovation.

These dynamic rapidly changing times even with the myriad challenges we’re facing present great opportunity for your generation. And tonight I thought I would share some advice some lessons on how to make the most of that opportunity.

You know the two questions I’ve been asked most often over the years are: “Who’s your favorite Disney character?” and “What is the biggest single factor that contributed to your success?” The answer to the first question is Tinkerbell in case you’re wondering. The answer to the second is: boldness. And if ever there was a time to be bold it is now!

One of the most valuable things I’ve learned from my own experiences as well as from mentors and friends is that the only way to accomplish meaningful things in life is by acting boldly. Being timid has never gotten anyone anywhere.

Of course boldness is more than just not being timid. It means taking swift and significant action in the face of fear or uncertainty. It means standing with courage and conviction when confronted with tough or unpopular choices. It means having an unwavering commitment to honesty integrity and doing the right thing. It means having a deep and abiding curiosity about people places ideas and the willingness to try something altogether new.

And being bold requires ambition and a willingness to dream big! When you are in your early twenties as many of you are there is no such thing as having dreams that are too big. Your possibilities are enormous. My advice—be optimistic. Be confident and have faith in yourself and your abilities. Believe your dreams are achievable and don’t let anyone tell you they’re not.

You also need to be resilient. Fortunately you’ve already proven you are after getting through what has been an historically difficult year….and graduating!

All of these qualities – resiliency ambition curiosity optimism and a willingness to dream big – will serve you well and enable you not only to make the most of opportunities but also contend with other challenges including failure.

By the way failure is not the end of the world or even the end of the road!

When I was your age I dreamed of being a network anchorman. And after graduating from college I got a job at a small TV station as a weatherman and planned to work my way up.

Unfortunately I quickly realized I was a terrible weatherman and I didn’t have a chance at fulfilling my ultimate dream. So at the ripe old age of 23 I decided to quit my job and do something completely different. It was a bold move—given that I had no idea what the future held. I ended up getting a job at ABC as a low level and I mean really low-level production assistant….and not long afterwards my boss called me into his office and told me I was unpromotable giving me two weeks to find another job!

My career was off to a bit of a rough start it would seem! In my first two years I failed as a weatherman and a guy I worked for told me I wasn’t good enough to ever be promoted.

Fortunately he was wrong—I got another job…a promotion and the rest as they say is history.

The fact is there will be setbacks and naysayers along the way. So what? That’s life!

Nearly every successful person has struggled or failed at some point. Steve Jobs was fired from Apple the company he founded. The guy who made the decision has since called it ‘one of the biggest regrets of his life.’ No kidding! Walt Disney was fired from one of his first jobs as a newspaper artist because the editor felt he “lacked imagination” and “had no original ideas.” Can you believe that?

Walt failed a number of times over the years however – always the optimist – he never stopped dreaming big and being bold. And I’m proud to say we have continued his legacy. In fact as President Hartzell noted in his generous introduction we have been bold deal makers throughout my tenure. But the heart of our boldness has always rested in our storytelling.

Some years back the talented people at Pixar pitched us a film about the very special cultural tradition of Mexico’s Dia de los Muertos the Day of the Dead. It was filled with colorful characters folk art and great authentic music all set in a textured beautiful world. Then we heard from skeptics who thought it was narrow and so culturally dependent that it would never resonate globally. The opposite proved true. Coco touched people’s hearts everywhere it was released because it celebrated the diversity of the human experience and the beauty and liveliness of the Mexican culture.

A similar situation arose with a film I know many of you saw Marvel’s Black Panther the film I’m most proud of. It was pitched by a talented Black director Ryan Coogler as a Black superhero story with a predominantly Black cast and once again many believed it would fail. Of course they were completely wrong! Black Panther was groundbreaking—a hugely successful film that became a cultural phenomenon and a powerful force for good. One bold decision changed the way people see heroes and had a lasting impact on the world!

So no matter how you choose to contribute whether through the stories you tell the career you pursue or the important changes you help bring about our world needs your generation to be bold! To take on ambitious projects. To address the challenges facing us today and not just on a grand scale. Just imagine if everyone in your generation did one bold thing even something relatively small—the collective power of those millions of actions would be massive!

And if any of you doubt your power just look at all you’ve accomplished here at UT! Look for example at the incredible work you’ve done in response to the most pressing challenge of our time the COVID-19 virus. You have developed critical parts of the vaccine in your research labs and you’ve played a key role in getting local communities including underrepresented communities vaccinated.

“What starts here changes the world.” You’re already doing it!

You leave here today arguably better able and better equipped to change the world than any generation before you—thanks to the amazing technological tools at your disposal tools you are adept at using. Use them to construct rather than destruct. Build understanding respect and tolerance. Be bold and fight the evils of hatred and contempt. Be a force for good in our world. And help to ensure all people have access to the kinds of opportunities that may lead to greater fulfillment satisfaction and success. Be builders not destroyers of truth and civility.

And never ever stop believing you can make a difference. As Steve Jobs said: “The ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones who do.”

You know one of the most curious things about life is the speed with which it passes. I know this is a hard concept for young people to grasp. But just think about how fast your time here at UT flew by. Here I am at 70 and it feels like just yesterday I was 22 years old with big plans and a lifetime to accomplish them. Looking back I could never have imagined I would have the incredible opportunities I’ve had over the years. It’s been quite a journey one for which I am exceedingly grateful.

All of you have so much of life ahead of you. And while I’m exhorting you to be doers to get out there and change the world I also hope you enjoy the experience.

Sure there will be tough days perhaps some really tough days even.

But there will also be lots of good days lots of great days. And tons of pleasant surprises….like meeting the love of your life who most of you haven’t met yet. Or having children. Or discovering a passion. Or finding a great job that leads to a great career.

As I reflect on my life I hesitate to suggest I’d change much because life has been really good to me. But I know this—if I could do it all over again I would take time to appreciate things more.

It’s the equivalent of smelling the roses but it’s more than that—it’s not sweating little things or getting mad at petty nonsense. It’s not about wasting time but having license to be frivolous every so often. It’s that incredibly valuable ability to savor the beauty of your life and all of the happy fulfilling and cool parts of it.

My sincere hope is that all of you will embrace life embrace it enthusiastically! Enjoy the beauty of a summer day or the most delicious pizza you’ve ever eaten—I love pizza! Go for a spin on your bike take salsa lessons eat dessert….go to Disneyland!

And don’t just wait for these opportunities to present themselves. Be adventurous! Be curious. Try new things especially things you never imagined you could or would do.

Most important cherish the relationships you have with the people in your lives. Invest in those relationships. Coach your children’s soccer team take a road trip with your friends…. and remember to call home and talk with your folks every once in a while!

I promise you won’t regret a minute you spend with the people you love.

This may surprise you but I would trade places with any one of you in a heartbeat and do it all over again. Life is an unexpected exhilarating fulfilling adventure!

So my advice to all of you as you embark on that adventure: be bold. Don’t be in the business of playing it safe. Be in the business of creating possibilities for greatness.

Dream big and be optimistic! If your first dream doesn’t come true find another one and pursue it with equal conviction!

And speak up! Speak the truth even when it’s difficult for others to hear.

Help solve humanity’s most complex and pressing issues through your words and actions.

Use technology to heal not to harm.

Be a force for good in our world! There’s so much that needs fixing.

And along the way be sure to embrace life. Live it to the fullest have fun appreciate every single moment. And start now!

To imagine and engineer the magical kingdom Disney has employed some of the most creative minds in the world (dubbed Imagineers) to work together to design world-class attractions that are both awe-inspiring and entertaining.

When Walt Disney opened the gates for the first time on July 17 1955 the park consisted of 33 different attractions. Today 13 of these opening day experiences still exist to delight visitors with timeless thrills and memories while the full Disneyland park has expanded to over 50 unique attractions.

Assorted ride vehicles hand-silkscreened attraction posters and other objects from the 25000-piece Disneyland and Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom collection infuse almost every corner of the 4569-square-foot house with playfulness. But none of it comes with the deal — the house fetched $2.24 million with multiple offers six days after listing on April 23.

It closed 12% over the asking price on May 17.

“I didn’t want to make it so kitschy that a family couldn’t move in with whatever their own spin on this house is” says Rummell a Hollywood voice-over talent who plans to relocate the bulk of the collection to a new primary residence in Dana Point.

He also plans to sell 1000 pieces in December at a two-day exhibition and sale put on by Van Eaton Galleries in Sherman Oaks that he expects to draw a minimum of $2 million.

“The biggest auction where a guy like me sold off a whole house full of Disney stuff did about $7 million in two days” he says. “If I do half of that I will be very happy.”

Going to auction is “all the big stuff” including four vintage ride vehicles seen during a recent tour of the Yorba Linda home. They include a Rocket Jets rocket an Autopia racer car and a Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride buggy from Magic Kingdom with two rows of seats versus Disneyland’s one.

Another is the Skyway gondola similar to one recently sold at auction for $600000.

The gondola anchors the upstairs bonus room where it shares space with a 70-pound Monstro the Whale tooth “Pirates of the Caribbean” pinball machine and handpainted attraction signs once attached to the side of the Disneyland Omnibus. A 1955 Disneyland opening day pennant hangs among the hundreds of narrow pointed flags covering a plank ceiling.

Also displayed are various props from movies whose trailers Rummell has voiced in that deep resonant style he slips into so easily as he leads visitors through the house. Other times he goes into the announcer voice he used during a brief stint as the Voice of Disneyland in the early ’90s.

He doesn’t speak that way normally.

A lifelong Disney enthusiast Rummell began building the collection with his Donald Duck collector wife after they married in the early 1980s. The pieces create designated Disney themes in their longtime home from a Main Street USA living room to a formal dining room designed after the Mark Twain Riverboat and Sailing Ship Columbia which Rummell’s grandfather helped build he said.

Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room inspired the look of a bathroom in the workspace house addition near Rummell’s office and glassed-in studio.

A Mickey Mouse recording light above the studio is among the keepers he plans to relocate to Dana Point where a new studio was going up.

“Can you imagine the voice talents that have walked underneath that light? I always think of that whenever I’m in my studio” he says.

Haunted Mansion plaques adorn a brick-covered passageway to the kitchen.

The open and airy kitchen combines different Disney restaurants from Club 33 to Plaza Gardens. An original Club 33 foiled glass sign hangs above the doorway to the dining room.

According to Rummell it was one of three initially made in the early days of Club 33.

When the time came to swap it for another the sign maker held onto it. It ended up with a collector.

“That collector knew that it would be special to me” Rummell says. “We had my dad’s 75th birthday at Club 33. Terry and I had our 33rd anniversary at Club 33. And so I traded him for it. That doesn’t come with the house.”

The nearby Disney train room packs railroad artifacts from bells to wheels. Overhead a model train circled a tunnel painted inside a Grand Canyon Diorama mural and past a building where a miniature Walt Disney looks out the window.

It is one of several Hidden Mickeys on the property.

The old-fashioned movie theater behind a hidden door evokes Main Street Cinema.

Up the staircase with its replica Mark Twain Riverboat hand railings is the spacious Disney Dream Suite. A glass door opens to a balcony with ironwork inspired by Carnation Plaza Gardens.

The balcony overlooks a resort-style backyard with a half basketball court an in-ground trampoline and a swimming pool with a waterfall and waterslide behind it. Next to the waterfall is a Mickey Mouse topiary — yet another Hidden Mickey.

Sworn to secrecy Mr. Zaslav’s lieutenants snacked on a breakfast of artisanal doughnuts from a 24-hour bakery as they finalized their pitch. Just before 8 a.m. ahead of schedule their quarry arrived: John Stankey the AT&T chief executive who controlled the WarnerMedia assets that Mr. Zaslav coveted.

A journey that began with an informal emoji-speckled email exchange in February was now fully underway. The covert discussions would eventually last three months stretching from Dallas to the Denver suburbs to downtown Manhattan where a war room was established in the cramped garden level of the rented townhouse. To prevent leaks bankers used maritime nicknames like “Columbus” and “Magellan.” Even the chief executive of WarnerMedia was kept in the dark while his company was being negotiated out from under him.

It would culminate on Monday with the announcement of a blockbuster media deal that combined AT&T’s WarnerMedia including HBO CNN and the Warner Bros. film studio with Discovery’s cable and broadcast holdings creating a powerful new force in American entertainment sports reality TV news and streaming video. And it represented an astounding late career act for Mr. Zaslav 61 that would put him in control of one of the biggest media companies in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA1LzIyL2Rpc2NvdmVyeS13YXJuZXItbWVkaWEtYXR0LXNwaW5vZmYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AT&T’s spinoff of WarnerMedia to Discovery only the latest failure,"The executive from outside Hollywood had a strong reason his company should pay billions to acquire an entertainment giant.

Pre-pandemic David Zaslav's end-of-summer parties in the Hamptons were a legendary networking event for anyone in media.

But storm clouds were on the horizon. In September 2020 Zaslav confided to a close friend that he was concerned about the fate of the company he'd spent 15 years building.

The COVID-19 virus had accelerated cord-cutting that's causing cable TV channels to lose subscribers.

And even as Zaslav prepped the launch of streaming service Discovery+ which now has 15 million subscribers he had thoughts about whether to suggest bundling Discovery with Disney according to a person familiar with talks.

Zaslav wondered how he would stack up against the likes of Netflix and Disney without more content and if he would be forced to sell if he couldn't get bigger to compete with those companies with their seemingly bottomless pockets.

The answer would soon come. A missed golf game in February led to an email between Zaslav and AT&T CEO John Stankey culminating in their boards signing a merger deal on Sunday night.

The combined company worth $120 billion in enterprise value would unite Discovery with AT&T's WarnerMedia home to CNN HBO and Warner Bros.

A person familiar with the deal told Insider that AT&T didn't consider Comcast a viable partner because it was likely to be a slow-moving conversation held up by thorny regulatory issues. Zaslav known for delivering fast yes or nos to business partners would be able to move ahead with speed.

And now the former lawyer for Discovery founder John Hendricks is the new king of media set to oversee $20 billion in content spend topping Netflix's $17 billion. Together Discovery and WarnerMedia will span every genre from Hollywood movies and TV shows to reality TV to news and sports. Most importantly they're already global.

Zaslav is a master deal-maker

Over the years he's secured the $1.6 billion European rights to the Olympics and the $2 billion PGA golf rights; bought Scripps Networks owner of HGTV and Food Network; and launched OWN with Oprah Winfrey.

Zaslav wooed Scripps CEO Ken Lowe for a decade before consummating the $14.6 billion deal in 2018. Lowe remains on Discovery's board and a personal friend said a Zaslav friend. ""How many people survive after a merger? Usually you ditch people. He doesn't.""

In another coup in 2008 Zaslav convinced Winfrey to go into business with him and create a cable channel together.

""He had an incredible knack for developing strong relationships. Oprah Winfrey is a great example of someone who the world wanted to do business with but David had an incredible knack for making people want to work with him"" said his former boss Tom Rogers who was president of NBC Cable where Zaslav was head of distribution and new media.

The Discovery CEO also was early in laying foundations overseas where rival media companies are now trying to bulk up.

""It's the only media company that I've worked with in the last two decades where building a unified global presence was a core part of the strategy"" said Joe Ravitch co-founder of Raine the media-focused merchant bank.

""Plus David actually shows up. You couldn't say that about a lot of other American CEOs. Talk to David about European or Latin American TV and he knows the details and the people there."" Zaslav is on the board of Mexican programming giant Televisa now merging with Univision.

'He's more aggressive than one of the great whites on 'Shark Week.'

Yet Zaslav's fight for Scripps created bad blood with then-Viacom chief executive Bob Bakish who was significantly outbid on the deal.

""He's masterful at presenting himself as an aw-shucks guy from Rockland County but underneath in the middle of a deal he's more aggressive than one of the great whites on 'Shark Week'"" said a friend.

Zaslav is also known as a CEO who keeps a tight rein on programming costs. He's unsentimental and quick to rotate executives if they are not performing though his key aides have been with him for years.

""Sometimes it is difficult for his staff to keep up with his expectations...but this is characteristic of a good leader who is on a mission"" Discovery founder John Hendricks said of Zaslav.

He's also known for squeezing costs out of operations which could concern WarnerMedia employees who've already been through years of restructuring under AT&T. The combination has promised $3 billion in synergies.

Indeed after the Discovery and Scripps deal Zaslav promised to wring $350 million in synergies from the business but by the time the integration was done the Discovery boss had cut his way to $1 billion.

Brooklyn-born Zaslav attended high school in Rockland County where he was captain of the tennis team. His Facebook page is full of old school friendships and trips with the former GE CEO Jack Welch.

He's known for sporting the sleeveless fleece vests popular with financial industry executives and for bringing swag bags to meetings.

Zaslav is also one of the highest-paid CEOs in media history. His 2020 pay was $37 million and the WarnerMedia deal would entitle him to some 14.8 million in options worth $190 million according to The Wall Street Journal.

He's used his salary to buy some of the most sought-after real estate around buying the Hollywood home of ""The Godfather"" film director Robert Evans for $16 million and snapping up Conan O'Brien's apartment on Central Park West. His Greenwich Village home where the WarnerMedia deal was cooked up is now on the market according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The Discovery Channel started in 1985 with a documentary about the frigid waters of the North Atlantic. It's now available in every corner of the globe.

Running WarnerMedia's top-tier assets like HBO and spending big on movies and shows is a far different game from the unscripted business that's Discovery's bread and butter.

But Zaslav is likely to get at least a warm initial reception. One Warner executive told friends that Zaslav's unexpected arrival would bring structure and order versus the ""move-fast and break things"" style of the WarnerMedia's current chief executive Jason Kilar whose future with the company is still unclear.

Along with their wives they were seen at their swanky private club where pillars of the local business scene gather to celebrate their rarefied status.

As it turned out the dinner was anything but a celebration. It’s unclear exactly what was said but presumably Stankey told his old crony that he was about to unwind the final remaining vestige of their costly empire-building fantasy that evaporated billions of dollars in shareholder value over the past decade.

This past Monday AT&T made it official and announced it was spinning off its WarnerMedia conglomerate defenestrating brands such as CNN HBO and Warner Studios into an odd new company that will be run by a smallish rival Discovery Inc.

Again I can’t say exactly what went down during the dinner but with the deal Stankey all but admitted to corporate America that the last 10 years of his career — and Stephenson’s — was a significant waste of time.

The story of AT&T’s disaster is one of hubris (these guys thought they could remake a world that didn’t need remaking) and ego (they thought they could do no wrong until it was glaringly obvious they were doing so).

It’s also a story about staying in your lane. What looks good on paper often falls apart in the execution when you’re spread so painfully thin.

Wall Street-types who have been following the Steph & Stank show say the signs the duo were operationally unequipped to “transform” AT&T came as early as 2011. That’s when they attempted to buy Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile unit for $39 billion.

The duo was so confident (that ­hubris thing again) they could get the deal through the Obama Department of Justice that they even negotiated a whopping $6 billion breakup fee if it failed as a way to get DT to the bargaining table.

And guess what: The Obama DOJ did what many observers (except Steph & Stank) saw coming a mile away and said “no go” because the merger would eliminate a wireless carrier and possibly cause consumers to pay more for service.

Steph & Stank were left licking their wounds and paying John Legere then the flamboyant CEO of T-Mobile known for his long hair and leather jackets that $6 billion fee. Legere of course is a perfect foil for the buttoned-down Texas suits — both optically and as it turns out operationally. He quickly rebranded T-Mobile as “Un-Carrier” and began a massive expansion including the acquisition of Sprint. His stock price soared.

Still undeterred in their quest for greatness Steph & Stank then conjured up the odd notion that getting into the satellite-TV business was the key to success. They bought DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015 apparently unaware that the streaming revolution and cord cutting was making this business increasingly worthless.

In 2016 came the $85 billion deal for Warner (then called Time Warner) that suddenly made the Texas suits players in media (CNN) cable (HBO) and Hollywood (Warner Bros).

AT&T’s acquisition of DirecTV proved to be a colossal failure as the satellite-TV business was becoming history as streaming services became the norm. AP

Again it all sounded good on paper. But with so much time dedicated to buying Warner integrating it into the larger company and defending it to then-President Donald Trump’s antitrust police who challenged the deal Steph & Stank seemed to ignore just about everything else.

AT&T’s rollout of the next generation of wireless connectivity superfast 5G has now lagged significantly behind T-Mobile and by having to focus on media so much Steph & Stank allowed other competitors to get into the game at a faster clip.

Assets such as the floundering Direct­TV unit remained a drag on earnings because people hated the service even if you could get “Game of Thrones” at a discount.

Steph & Stank were slow as Texas molasses to answer the Netflix and Amazon streaming juggernauts with something called HBO Max that came online only last year.

Through it all Steph & Stank remained confident at least publicly. Shares were getting crushed and an activist investor demanded changes but Stephenson and his board last year appointed Stankey as new CEO.

Almost as soon as Stephenson was out of the way and on to retirement Stankey sold a chunk of DirecTV now valuing the asset at a fraction of its original cost. Ditto for the ill-fated Warner purchase which after the Discovery deal will fetch AT&T only about $43 billion of the $85 billion it spent on buying the assets not to mention the countless millions the company invested to fight the DOJ. (AT&T ultimately prevailed in court.)

AT&T officials say on paper the deal is closer to a wash because of cash flow produced over the past three years and other savings but they don’t deny the mistake in strategy. Plus you got to hand it to Stankey. That he still has his job as CEO is a testament to his willingness to throw his boss and himself under the proverbial bus. On the other hand he ­really didn’t have much choice given what went down at AT&T.

But if you’re a shareholder do you really trust this guy to run the show?"

Here's the answer from a plastics expert before you ditch the effort,"Photograph of the inside of a garbage collection center in Vine Hill California December 8 2020. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Smith Collection/Gado | Archive Photos | Getty Images

Recycling may make you feel better in a very small way about your role in helping to avert a global apocalypse but even in ""friendly"" places from John Oliver to NPR podcasts recycling especially of plastics is being given a hard look. More people are wondering: Does it work? The debate is not new. For years the economics of plastic recycling have been questioned. But the problem is not going away. The globe is already producing two trillion pounds of solid waste a year and is on pace to add more than a trillion more on an annual basis in the coming decades according to World Bank data. A recent study found that the 20 top petrochemical companies in the world among the group Exxon Mobil and Dow are responsible for 55% of the world's single-use plastic waste and in the U.S. specifically we are generating about 50 kilograms of throwaway plastic a year per person. The Covid pandemic has heightened attention to the issue as use of disposable goods went up anywhere from 30% to 50% according to Tom Szaky CEO of recycling company TerraCycle and reuse platform Loop who joined CNBC's Leslie Picker on a recent CNBC Evolve Livestream about sustainability and business. He says concerns about the macroeconomics of waste management systems suffering economically are real and there are ways to solve it that don't just rely on government. We all need to take a deeper look at how we recycle beyond the feel-good blue bin and what we can do to get past the problems.

1. The economics of recycling are broken.

Szaky says recent reporting on the economic issues for plastics recycling and restrictions around the world on imported recyclables which are both weighing on the sector are not an anti-environmental attack but ""absolutely rooted in facts."" He says it is important for consumers to understand that just because you recycle an item does not mean it will be recycled in the end. ""What makes something be recycled in a country doesn't have to do with what we normally think: Can it be recycled? Most of the things we put in blue bins that are not recycled are put in the garbage because they are things waste companies can't make money off and that is the true bottleneck"" he said. The right question is ""Can a garbage company the actual company in charge of the recycling in the geography recycle it at a profit?""

The CNBC Evolve Global Summit is coming up on June 16 2021 On deck: CEOs from Novartis Coca-Cola Adidas McDonald's Hyatt and more international leaders join the CNBC Evolve Global Summit on June 16 for provocative conversations about adapting innovating and transforming in this new era of business. Learn more & register.

According to Szaky what's happened is a profitability model that is decreasing as oil prices have gone down which started in 2015 and even after a commodities market recovery post-Covid have stayed down relative to recent history. The petrochemicals companies that make plastics rely less on recyclables when the price of their core commodity oil is lower. Second China stopped importing recyclable waste a move followed by other countries in 2018. Both issues are critically important to the business model of recycling and the health of the infrastructure because they circle back around to how much demand there is to collect those material types. ""And it all hurt the business construct for recycling companies and that means our recycling capabilities are deteriorating"" Szaky said. ""Recycling is not out there trying to do the best it can but maximize profit and we need to think about that as we aim for a more circular economy"" he said.

2. A packaging industry mega trend is working against recycling

The biggest global trend in packaging is not helping. Efforts to reduce costs in products and packaging are ""objectively reducing value"" Szaky said ""which also makes them less recyclable."" The ""lightweighting"" of packages making them have less physical material and more complexity as a result of that design challenge makes them less profitable to recycle.

All of these economic issues lead to a situation in which what people would like to see is not what they would actually see if they went behind the scenes in the recycling industry. But Szaky says at the same time consumers want to recycle more and more companies are leaning into their own recycling. What companies decide to do about recycling on their own initiative — and pay for — can be done in spite of the challenging economics and can still pay off for the companies in the future. That's the TerraCycle business model working with companies to fund their own voluntary recycling efforts. And that is more important at a time when the economics of consumer recycling are a mess.

3. Why companies don't recycle enough but should more

Szaky says what's really important right now is companies deciding to lean in and create their own recycling programs. But he says it is still not easy for the corporate mindset to embrace. ""As a retailer or brand if you just frame it as 'the right thing to do' the funding will be small and sporadic because there is no P&L logic to do it. But if you can use it to drive foot traffic like Walmart with car seats or Staples with pens it can be monetizable"" he said. Brands that run their own recycling programs should be doing it as part of a plan to drive more market share and brand preference. And he says it becomes ""monetizable in a recognizable way"" the bigger they become and the faster they can grow. ""That is true for any sustainability measure a company is looking to implement in the short term.""

watch now

Some products won't be recycled unless companies are the recycler. A dirty diaper or toothbrush or cigarette is not recyclable because it costs too much. It is another economic problem not a physics or chemistry one. TerraCycle recently launched a diaper recycling program in Holland and now it is expanding to many countries. ""Diaper recycling doesn't make sense from an economic perspective. It is expensive to collect and process"" Szaky said. But for the company that leads ""it can drive core value maybe better than TV ads"" he added. Consumers want to do the right thing and companies may want to do the right thing as well in acknowledging an environmental crisis — and fund a feel-good marketing campaign — but Szaky stressed that they need to see ""not just the right thing but that it will pay back."" Szaky's business recently teamed with a luxury watchmaker on the world's tallest landfill: Mt. Everest. The mountain is littered with oxygen tanks from previous climbs and the watchmaker was able to both clean up the mess an expensive undertaking and source metal for its watches which may add to the story it sells consumers in a way competitors can't match.

4. The real solution is obvious: Consuming less

The white elephant the fundamental answer to the challenge is modulating consumption downward but Szaky says that is a hard one for the business world to champion. ""It is fundamentally de-growth."" Even working with companies to create products from recyclables and where the recycling is part of the product story and selling point ""is not the answer to the garbage problem"" he says. It may be among the best ways to manage waste in a circular economy but Szaky says we will need to aim to go back to a world where garbage doesn't exist. ""Before the 1950s we received milk from the milkman and mended clothes and cobbled shoes"" he says. Reuse does still exist at scale today in certain markets such as beer kegs and propane tanks but not nearly enough and without the convenience of an infrastructure which makes return easy and widespread. That is one of the keys he sees for the future.

5. Reusable versus recyclable

While the goal of zero waste is ambitious it is realistic to imagine a world in which more consumer products become reusable if they can be easily returned in the circular economy. Reusable versions of products from Nestle Procter & Gamble Kroger Walgreens and hundreds of other retailers are being or will in the future be made available to consumers.

We can switch a consumer who maybe doesn't even care about sustainability and that's frankly the most important. We need to bring everyone along not just people who view this as a high-passion project.

Szaky envisions the buy-and-return-anywhere model as a key one for the future. ""Buy your favorite shampoo bottle in a reusable form at a Walgreens in New York and drop it off at Burger King and buy an Impossible Whopper in reusable packaging too and drop that off somewhere else."" This model can help solve a big problem: consumer behavior. Szaky says while there is a significant consumer market motivated by environmental concerns and consumption for the recycling industry to really work it needs to avoid relying on the most-motivated consumers. Even plastic recycling that is economic today such as soda bottles only results in 1 in 4 bottles being recycled. The No. 1 goal for most consumers will remain convenience and value. A reusable package is an upgrade over a disposable package in an objective way and with the convenience of drop-off locations it can lead to an easier shift in behavior but it has to be offered at the right value to consumers. ""With all three things coming together we can switch a consumer who maybe doesn't even care about sustainability and that's frankly the most important"" Szaky said. ""We need to bring everyone along not just people who view this as a high-passion project.""

It's creating a huge waste problem for Australia,"Installing solar panels is an easy way to lower your carbon footprint and cut electricity bills. But our recent research found there are many incentives to remove them prematurely adding to Australia’s massive waste problem.

Researchers predict Australia will accumulate 1 million tonnes of solar panel waste by 2047 — the same weight as 19 Sydney Harbour Bridges.

But this number is likely to be higher as we found people often choose to remove panels after just 10 to 12 years of use. This is much earlier than their estimated end-of-life age of 30 years (and potentially older).

Unfortunately recycling is just a small part of the solution. So why is this happening and what can we do about it?

Australia’s shocking ‘material footprint’

Australians have heeded the call to increase renewable energy. The installed capacity of panels across Australia has increased dramatically from 25.3 megawatts in 2007 to 77078 megawatts in 2017. Likewise the rooftop solar market capacity has almost doubled between 2014 and 2018.

Australia has committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goal of using fewer resources. And this requires us to use products (like solar panels) efficiently with less waste. But Australia’s 2020 progress update shows our per capita material footprint is increasing. In fact it’s one of the highest in the world at 70% above the OECD average.

Read more: There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boom

To help lower our growing material footprint and keep e-waste out of landfills we need to ensure solar panels are sustainable in life as in death.

It is assumed the primary reason why people remove solar panels is due to technical failures such as when they’ve reached their expiry after 30 years or breaking due to extreme weather or during transport. But failing to generate electricity doesn’t explain why many are thrown away prematurely.

So we interviewed solar panel installers recycling organisations advocacy groups and local government waste managers across the Northern Territory. And our resulting qualitative research found social and economic incentives for removing solar panels.

Out with the new in with the newer

We found a whole system of panels gets removed when only a few panels are damaged as the new panels must have similar electrical properties to the old.

If the panels are still under warranty the manufacturer often pays to replace the whole set even when only a few are faulty. This means working panels are removed alongside the faulty panels prematurely turning into waste.

Solar panels have also become a commodity item. Many of us dump old phones and cars when newer technology becomes available and solar panels get the same treatment. After recovering the investment in solar panels through reduced electricity bills some people are keen to get newer more efficient models with a new warranty.

Our research also suggests government incentives aimed at rolling out more solar panels have caused consumers to replace their entire solar array. This is because previous rebates didn’t cover the replacement of only one or a few panels.

Finally the life of solar inverters is usually 10-12 years much shorter than the 30-year life span of the panels themselves. Some people use this as an opportunity to install a new set of solar panels when they change their inverters.

So why can’t we just recycle them?

There’s currently little research on what we can do with panels when they’re removed for reasons other than technical failure.

Researchers often put forward recycling as the preferred option for removed panels. But sending the growing number of working panels to recycling facilities is a tremendous waste of resources and increases the burden for panel recycling which is still in its nascent stages.

Managing waste is the responsibility of states and territories and they align their waste strategies with the federal government’s National Waste Policy.

But there’s no directive yet at the national level on solar panel disposal specifically. This means there’s a patchwork of policies across the states and territories for managing this waste.

AAP Image/Mick Tsikas

Victoria for example has identified solar panels as the fastest growing waste stream in the state’s overall e-waste flow and the state government has banned them from landfills.

But such measures wouldn’t work for the Northern Territory given its lack of processing facilities and the distance to the recycling centres in southern Australia which are at least 1500 kilometres away. With ample open land they’re more likely to end up dumped illegally.

What do we do?

Australia needs clear guidelines at a national level on collecting transporting stockpiling and disposing solar panels. A lack of clear policy hampers state territory and local governments from managing this waste effectively.

By proposing recycling as preferred option to manage this waste we risk excluding other important options in the waste management hierarchy such as reducing waste in the first place by making solar panels that last extending their life.

The federal government has also touted “product stewardship” as a potential solution. This is where those involved in producing selling using and disposing products share the responsibility to reduce their environmental impact.

But this model wouldn’t effectively service regional and remote areas as collecting and transporting goods from remote locations comes at a very high financial and environmental cost.

It’s worth noting some panels do undergo a kind of “second life”. There’s a unique demand for secondhand panels from people who can’t afford new systems those looking to live off-grid small organisations keen to reduce energy bills and mobile home and caravan owners.

But with a number of massive solar farms proposed across northern Australia it’s more important than ever to explore new strategies to manage removed solar panels with clear policies and creative solutions.

Gunaikurnai Creation Story

The story of our creation starts with Borun the pelican who traversed our Country from the mountains in the north to the place called Tarra Warackel in the south.

As Borun travelled down the mountains he could hear a constant tapping sound but he couldn’t identify the sound or where it was coming from. Tap tap tap. He traversed the cliffs and mountains and forged his way through the forests. Tap tap tap. He followed the river systems across our Country and created songlines and storylines as he went. Tap tap tap.

He walked on alone and when he got down into the deeper inlets near Tarra Warackel (now known as Port Albert) he put down his canoe and much to his surprise there was a woman in it. She was Tuk the musk duck. Borun was very happy to see Tuk and they married and became the mother and father of the five clans the creators of Gunaikurnai.

The creation story is about the origin of our people. It helps to explain the bonds we have to our Country and reminds us that our ancestors are still watching over the landscape today.

It is important for us to be able to walk in their footsteps and follow their journeys from thousands of years ago – it is a powerful spiritual aspect to our cultural heritage and fundamental to our recognition and respect. We are guided by the spirits of our ancestors when we walk through this Country.

Preserving the past is important to better manage our cultural landscapes. Patrick Mullett is a proud Gunaikurnai man working on Country to manage Aboriginal cultural heritage.

But in America’s moment of racial reckoning critics ask is it right?

Payday lenders and other businesses that offer high-cost small-dollar loans say they serve customers that big traditional banks ignore.

But a WFAA investigation discovered the money that finances many predatory lenders comes from the very same big banks.

It’s a part of a larger pattern of economic injustice for low-income communities of color south of Interstate 30 which is a dividing line in Dallas and the subject of the ongoing WFAA investigative series “Banking Below 30.”

Predatory Lending

The term predatory lending is defined by government regulators as businesses that among other things fail to fully disclose or explain the true costs and risk of loans; have “risky loan terms and structures” that “make it more difficult or impossible for borrowers to reduce their indebtedness” and that charge “customers unearned concealed or unwarranted fees.”

Texas’ Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner regulates the payday auto title installment and pawn lending businesses to ensure each “provides compliant financial products” but those businesses under Texas law are still allowed to charge interest rates and fees far in excess of what a traditional banks would charge.

Leon Cox said he regrets going to a payday lender when he was short on cash.

“I was working from temp agency to temp agency and there were a couple times I just couldn’t make rent” he said. “With a payday loan it’s never worth it. You'll take out $500 and end up paying maybe $1500 back.”

High-cost lending is a popular business below I-30. Records show there are 88 storefront locations in southern Dallas.

According to the advocacy group Texas Appleseed in 2019 payday and auto title lenders charged Texans more than $2 billion in fees. While Blacks and Latinos make up 45% of all Texas households they make up 71% of auto title customers and 74% of payday loan customers according to an analysis of FDIC data by Texas Appleseed.

Cox said these types of lenders “keep you down.""

""It's the old cliché – the rich get richer and poor get poorer” he explained.

Our review of public records filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reveals that almost 20 banks are funding or have recently funded predatory lenders. Some are big banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Other are based in Texas like Texas Capital Bank of Texas Veritex Bank TBK Bank Amegy Bank and Independent Bank.

We reached out to several industry groups representing high-cost small-dollar lenders. They say their fees are reasonable given the credit histories of their customers and that they are helping people get loans that banks have abandoned.

""Nearly half of Americans cannot afford a $400 unanticipated expense"" the Community Financial Services Association of America says on their website. ""By providing loans to those who cannot otherwise access traditional forms of credit small-dollar lenders help communities and small businesses thrive and allow money to be reinvested in local businesses and neighborhoods where it is needed most.""

“It's for economic exploitation” said the Rev. Frederick Haynes III pastor of Friendship-West Baptist Church in southern Dallas and vocal critic of high-cost lenders. In April he testified against them in a U.S. Senate hearing.

“It's a horrific cycle” he told WFAA. “It's a system that is designed to ensure that some thrive at the expense of others.”

Lenders to FirstCash

FirstCash based in Fort Worth operates 2770 pawn stores. Under Texas law a pawn dealer can charge up 240% interest on a loan. A review of records filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows Wells Fargo Texas Capital Bank and Bank of Texas are all creditors to FirstCash.

Data that Wells Fargo shares with the federal government that was analyzed by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition show the bank makes relatively few loans to low- to moderate-income borrowers in Dallas County. Their analysis shows that Wells Fargo made 18% of its home purchase loans to low- to moderate- income borrowers which is third from the bottom among banks in the county.

But Wells Fargo shares in a $400 million line of credit to FirstCash along with Bank of Texas Texas Capital Bank Amegy Bank Prosperity Bank First Tennessee Bank Independent Bank Southside and BBVA Bank according to SEC filings in 2016 and 2020.

We asked these banks why they choose to finance a high-cost lender. Bank of Texas Texas Capital First Tennessee and BBVA had no comment. Prosperity Independent and Southside didn’t respond to questions.

Amegy sent us a response.

“With regard to why Amegy would provide a loan to FirstCash we are active in making loans and providing banking services to businesses that operate within the law – including local state and federal – and who fit within our risk appetite” Amegy spokesperson Stefani Smith wrote. “We leave the decisions as to which businesses should be allowed to legally operate to elected officials and the enforcement of such laws to the appropriate authorities.”

So did Wells Fargo.

“Wells Fargo provides credit and services to companies in a variety of financial services industries” spokesperson Camille Brewer wrote. “We have relationships with companies that have demonstrated a strong ongoing commitment and capability to comply with applicable laws and regulations to their business operations.”

Ann Baddour with Texas Appleseed a nonprofit advocating for fair lending practices for low-income and minority communities said she’s not surprised to see Wells Fargo leading credit agreements for these high-cost lenders.

“Wells Fargo has a long history of being a creditor for payday and auto title lenders” Baddour said. “It's objectionable to me personally but it's legal. I can't tell them to not do it. But it's about values and building communities.”

FirstCash also sent us a response. The company provides “quick and convenient locations to buy value-priced merchandise and obtain small short-term collateralized pawn loans which customers are not obligated to repay” Chief Financial Officer R. Douglas Orr said in a statement.

“Pawn loans do not involve credit checks negative credit reporting or collections activities even if the customer does not repay or redeem the loan” Orr added. “All of the company’s pawn operations are fully licensed regulated and operated in accordance with all federal state and local laws.”

Lenders to Enova

Another high-cost lender is Enova which offers among other products payday loans online. In disclosures to the state of Texas Enova documents annual loan rates of 409% to 664%.

And who helps finance Enova's operations? In part Veritex Bank and TBK Bank – both based in Dallas. TBK has a $35 million credit agreement with Enova and Veritex $20 million according to this SEC filing.

We asked these banks why they choose to finance a high-cost lender. Veritex Bank had no comment. TBK Bank responded that “…we follow well-known policies applicable to all banks to ensure that our customers’ business activities comply with the law.”

In a statement Enova says its “…online services reach people and businesses all over the U.S. including places where banks no longer have branches…”

Lenders to World Finance

World Finance is another high-cost lender. At its 1200 storefront offices the company offers installment loans which under Texas law carry 80% to 113% interest plus fees and charges.

According to this 2015 SEC filing World Finance’s operations are financed in part by Wells Fargo with a commitment as high as $200 million and Texas Capital loaning up to $30 million.

This March 2020 filing with the SEC shows several other lenders to World Finance including Bank of Montreal First Tennessee Bank BankUnited Axos Bank and Pacific Western Bank.

Bank of Montreal BankUnited Axos and Pacific Western did not respond to questions. First Tennessee as before had no comment.

Lenders to Curo

In this SEC filing Curo discloses a $50 million credit agreement with several institutions such as BayCoast Bank Stride Bank Hancock-Whitney Bank Metropolitan Commercial Bank and a $10 million agreement with Royal Bank of Canada.

We reached out to all these banks about why they lend money to Curo.

Hancock-Whitney and Royal Bank of Canada had no comment.

Stride and Metropolitan Commercial did not respond.

In a statement BayCoast said it is the “lead bank on a revolving corporate credit facility” for Curo which “accesses this credit facility periodically for liquidity purposes and does not use the credit facility to fund consumer loans.”

“We evaluate all of our relationships regularly to ensure that our vendors maintain our high standards of operation” said James Wallace BayCoast chief operating officer.

Long history

Baddour said the rise of high-cost small-dollar lending targeting low-income people has a long history.

“In many ways we wouldn't even be having these conversations about payday loans if financial institutions so long ago didn't abandon these communities” Baddour said.

She's saying predatory lending echoes back to an older problem called redlining where banks refuse to lend in minority neighborhoods.

The Community Reinvestment Act is a law meant to repair that damage. It says banks are required to meet the credit needs of the minority community and reinvest in neighborhoods they've long ignored. But Pastor Haynes says when banks finance predatory lenders they violate the spirit of the law.

“I think it’s time for banking regulators to step up and say ‘We’re serious about this issue and we want to ensure that justice in banking is a norm’” Pastor Haynes said. “It's not just time. It's past time.”

One of those regulators is the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which oversees the biggest banks in the country.

“We do not comment on individual bank matters” said OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard in response to WFAA's questions.

But he pointed out that banks extending credit or loaning money to high-cost lenders doesn’t mean they are playing any role in those businesses' lending decisions.

“It is important to note that such nonbank lenders and companies are state-licensed and regulated” Hubbard added. “The OCC does not review and approve bank customers and generally does not determine what company or customer a bank may serve.”

Change in Policy

Some banks have begun to change their policies on financing predatory lenders. Capital One says it will not finance payday and auto title lenders. Chase Bank has stopped lending to them too. Key Bank in Ohio also stopped.

Bank of America had been a long-time lender to World Finance with a line of credit up to $150 million. However the bank says it terminated that relationship in 2020.

Bank of America now also offers a new product called Balance Assist. For a $5 fee existing customers can borrow up to $500 for terms that are far better than a payday lender – an industry Bank of America now says runs ""contrary to our values.”

“It's encouraging to me to see such a large financial institution take to heart all the feedback that has been around for a long time about the financial services needs of communities and really start to do something about it” Baddour said. “I deeply believe that that is the pathway forward.”

Banks that finance predatory lenders defend themselves by saying the practice is legal. But Pastor Haynes says in America's moment of racial reckoning these banks should be asking themselves “Is this right?”

“It creates a permanent underclass – permanent ghettos” he said. “And it's being financed by banking institutions. There's something diabolical and wrong with that picture.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vcmVhbC1ob3VzZXdpdmVzLW5ldy15b3JrLW1vcmdhbi1mYW1pbHktbmFtZS1xdWluY3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RHONY: Why Sonja Gets Heated About The Morgan Family Name,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vcmVhbC1ob3VzZXdpdmVzLW5ldy15b3JrLW1vcmdhbi1mYW1pbHktbmFtZS1xdWluY3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNwaGlsYWRlbHBoaWEuY29tL25ld3Mvc3BvcnRzL25iYS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtNzZlcnMvY3Jvd2QtY2FwYWNpdHktanVtcGluZy10by01MC1mb3Itc2l4ZXJzLWhvbWUtcGxheW9mZi1nYW1lcy8yODIzNzQ2L9IBjAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNwaGlsYWRlbHBoaWEuY29tL25ld3Mvc3BvcnRzL25iYS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtNzZlcnMvY3Jvd2QtY2FwYWNpdHktanVtcGluZy10by01MC1mb3Itc2l4ZXJzLWhvbWUtcGxheW9mZi1nYW1lcy8yODIzNzQ2Lz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crowd Capacity Jumping to 50% for Sixers' Home Playoff Games,"The Philadelphia 76ers will have even more fans cheering them on at home during the NBA playoffs as the Wells Fargo Center increases crowd capacity to 50%.

The Sixers swept the Wizards in the teams’ regular season series this year. Philly also heads into the game with no health concerns though coach Doc Rivers said this week he saw ""slippage"" in multiple areas over the final month of the regular season and wants his team to make sharper cuts ""clean up our execution offensively"" and play better transition defense.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy9pdC1mZWx0LWxpa2UtMzAwMDAtc2l4ZXJzLWRvYy1yaXZlcnMtc2F5cy1mYW5zLWVuZXJneS13YXMtYW1hemluZy1pbi1nYW1lLTEtd2luLW92ZXItd2l6YXJkcy_SAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL2l0LWZlbHQtbGlrZS0zMDAwMC1zaXhlcnMtZG9jLXJpdmVycy1zYXlzLWZhbnMtZW5lcmd5LXdhcy1hbWF6aW5nLWluLWdhbWUtMS13aW4tb3Zlci13aXphcmRzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It Felt Like 30000': Sixers' Doc Rivers Says Fans' Energy Was Amazing In Game 1 Win Over Wizards,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- It was loud inside the Wells Fargo Center as the Sixers took Game 1 of the First Round NBA Playoff series against the Washington Wizards. Tobias Harris led the team with 37 points and Ben Simmons recorded a double-double with 15 rebounds and 15 assists in the Sixers win Sunday afternoon.

And while the Wells Fargo Center isn't at full capacity yet it sure did feel like a sold-out crowd in South Philadelphia.

""The atmosphere was crazy every time a bucket was scored everybody was screaming"" a fan said.

""I thought the roof was going to come off that's how it felt"" another fan added.

It was the Sixers first playoff game back in South Philadelphia in more than two years and head coach Doc Rivers couldn't believe there were only 11160 fans.

""I can't believe that was 10 -11000 fans it can't be"" Rivers said. ""It felt like 30000 people in the stands. They were amazing let's keep it going.""

Danny Green also shouted out the fans during his postgame press conference.

""Their energy was amazing"" Green said.

They brought the energy early and didn't let their foot off the gas peddle. Early in the First Quarter they started the infamous ""ref you suck"" chant after a foul was called against MVP candidate Joel Embiid.

Fans showed their support for Embiid with MVP chants throughout the game. We even got a ""Trust the Process"" chant echoing throughout the Wells Fargo Center as Embiid was at the free-throw line at the end of the Third Quarter.

We got a ""Trust The Process"" chant going on down at the Wells Fargo Center fans are bringing the energy this afternoon #Sixers #NBAPlayoffs #TTP — CBS Philly (@CBSPhilly) May 23 2021

Embiid finished with 30 points.

Ben Simmons had a double-double recording 15 assists and 15 rebounds.

""I thought he was special tonight whoever he guarded had trouble scoring"" Doc Rivers said. "" He's a treasure something you don't see very often in this league. All I see is this greatness in him and I just want him to keep doing what he's doing.""

Philadelphia's COVID-19 restrictions were eased on Friday just in time for the start of the Sixers playoffs. The Wells Fargo Center is now allowed to have 50% capacity -- nearly doubling the crowd and fans are now separated by three feet rather than six.

""They set it up nice in there so it felt like it was packed in there even though it was only 10000 in there it felt like it was packed"" a fan said.

Masks are still required while indoors across Philadelphia.

Fans are hopeful Philadelphia will ease its restrictions again on June 11 lifting all capacity-related restrictions just in time for the second round of the NBA Finals.

Game 2 will be Wednesday night in Philadelphia.

With their senior year disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic their commencement ceremony was postponed. Roanoke College conferred degrees in a virtual ceremony on their original graduation date May 2 2020. On Saturday in the Salem Stadium the Class of 2020 returned to Salem for their in-person commencement ceremony.

President Michael C. Maxey referred to the Class of 2020 as “Roanoke College history-makers” and saluted them for their ability to stay connected to one another even as they finished their college careers from their homes.

“Never forget that you are twice graduated from Roanoke College” Maxey said. “No one has ever done that and I hope it leads to a special bond between and among you and between you and your college.”

The Class of 2020 is comprised of 428 graduates from 30 states and five countries. The top majors (in order) are business administration biology communication studies sociology and health and exercise science. Two hundred and fifteen graduates earned the Bachelor of Arts 80 obtained the Bachelor of Business Administration and 133 earned the Bachelor of Science.

Three students earned valedictorian honors in the Class of 2020 and though not all of them were able to make it to graduation Saturday all three were honored during the ceremony.

Benjamin Allen Vester an economics and political science major from Morgantown West Virginia delivered a speech at Saturday’s ceremony. Upon graduating Vester was a field representative for Sen. Joe Manchin D-West Virginia. Since then Vester earned a spot as a staff assistant with the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and now works in Washington D.C.

Vester spoke about his favorite campus traditions saying that even as the Class of 2020 didn’t get to experience their final months on campus the memories of those traditions shine brightly in his memory.

“We may not have had the opportunity to participate in the rituals of senior year and graduation the way previous classes have or hopefully future classes will” Vester said. “But through these traditions through our favorite memories of our almost four years in sunny Salem the class of 2020 belongs in its own unique way to what is bigger than ourselves — Roanoke College our alma mater which has indeed served us well.”

Kyle Elizabeth Grohbrugge is a health and exercise science major and public health minor from Grantham New Hampshire. Grohbrugge recently finished her first year at the University of Colorado where she is pursuing a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree. She’s working at an orthopedic clinic this summer where she works with patients who suffer from neck back shoulder and other pain. She is on track to graduate in December 2022.

Grohbrugge wasn’t able to attend Saturday’s ceremony but she did write a speech which Rev. Christopher M. Bowen read on her behalf. In it Grohbrugge compared a college career to hiking a mountain — an experience to which many Maroons can relate.

“There is still so much to explore and I wish you all the best of luck in continuing to find your own adventures after Roanoke College” Grohbrugge wrote.

Kaitlyn Renee Hefele is a biology major and Spanish minor from Ashland Virginia. She just graduated from James Madison University with a Master of Arts in teaching and recently accepted a position teaching biology at Nelson County High School in Virginia. She’s teaching summer school in Augusta County this summer and starting her full-time job in August.

A drop in the profitability of the company's cash cow could also affect its investment capacity in other sectors such as semiconductor contract manufacturing and displays.

The decline in the semiconductor operation's profitability in the period from January to March stems largely from a plant shutdown in Texas after cold weather caused power outages in mid-February and the opportunity loss during this period led to a drop in earnings.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In a past life the grounds of The Home Course in DuPont Wash. housed a plant that produced dynamite and black powder. The unique track — the sixth hole is shown here — will host stroke play for this month’s U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship. Photo courtesy of The Home Course

The Home Course in DuPont Wash. was once the site of a plant that produced and manufactured commercial explosives. The USGA seems to think the public golf course that now sits on the land is dynamite.

The sixth U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship is May 22-26 and The Home Course will be a part of the action serving as a co-host to stroke play rounds with Chambers Bay in University Place Wash. The Home Course designed by the late architect Mike Asmundson served as a U.S. Open local qualifying site for the championship held in 2015 at Chambers Bay. Before that The Home Course was the companion course for the U.S. Amateur in 2010 at Chambers Bay.

Championships are often reserved for older more famous facilities yet the 14-year-old Home Course is establishing an impressive résumé. It’s cooperatively owned by the Pacific Northwest Golf Association and Washington Golf. Both organizations plan to eventually house their offices on the scenic layout between Puget Sound Mount Rainier and the Olympic Mountains. GCSAA Class A superintendent Dennis Roque a 17-year GCSAA member oversees The Home Course.

“Dennis is going to do a great job” says Cory Isom USGA Green Section West Region agronomist. “Someone like him makes it easier for us to achieve what championship directors are looking for.”

Unless you’re from the area you may not know the entire fascinating story that literally lies beneath in and around The Home Course. The land was originally settled by multiple Native American tribes including the Nisqually Tribe. Europeans came next. The Hudson’s Bay Co. operated a trading post there. Eventually E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (now known as DuPont Co.) acquired the property in 1906 and its explosives plant was instrumental in western expansion. Black powder and dynamite were used to help clear the land for farming and railroads. Some rail remains on the golf course today.

The land’s transformation from explosives facility to golf course began to take shape in the late 1970s when Weyerhaeuser Co. took over the location with the intention of industrializing it. Weyerhaeuser DuPont and the Washington State Department of Ecology collaborated to launch a site cleanup with cooperation from the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historical Preservation the Nisqually Tribe the city of DuPont the DuPont Historical Society and other stakeholders.

Golf course construction was part of the meticulous thorough environmental remediation process. More than 50000 cubic yards of contaminated soil — the majority of it the result of explosive compounds — was removed from the site and sent to a hazardous waste landfill.



The contents of these barrels that were removed from the site before the golf course was constructed remains a mystery. “No one really knows what was in those barrels — at least not us anyway” says Home Course superintendent Dennis Roque. “It could not have been good.” Photo courtesy of Dennis Roque

“Before the cleanup it was a pretty gnarly joint” says Home Course equipment manager Joey Bass a seven-year GCSAA member who has been familiar with the property since before the golf course was initially seeded. Bass recalls workers wearing Tyvek protective suits to safeguard from hazardous materials.

A photo gallery on the state’s Department of Ecology website has a hole-by-hole breakdown of what was addressed during the massive cleanup effort. Here’s a sampling:

No. 4 has a natural topographical depression which was used as a disposal area for empty drums. The back tee is bordered by the foundation from a former manufacturing building.

No. 7 is the spot to be on a sunny day as it offers quite a view of Mount Rainier. It’s also where the site cleanup identified lead and other materials of concern.

No. 16 is an ideal place to take in Puget Sound. It’s also where a former explosives storage area was incorporated into the golf course design resulting in a distinct mound.

The history makes for some unconventional maintenance challenges for Roque and his crew. “Essentially it (the course) was capped and grown on gravel” he says. “That makes trying to grow grass pretty difficult.” The Home Course has T-1 bentgrass greens; the rest of the layout is a ryegrass/Poa annua mix. Roque says his biggest issue with the grass is that everything leaches and holding nutrients is difficult. His method of offsetting the gravel in order to secure soil nutrients is by sanding tees and fairways (80/20 sand/organic matter). “Pretty extensive sanding twice a year” Roque says of the work done on tees fairways and surrounds. “We bring in close to 270 tons of sand.”

Roque can’t easily aerify tees and fairways despite years of sanding. He has tried solid tines and tines bent 90 degrees. “It’s not too tough trying to solid-tine (tees) but pulling up a core is tough. You can bring up a lot of gravel” he says. “The most I can do is slice the fairways with a Bannerman using an 8-inch blade. You’re able to slice the fairways but aerifying is not in the cards yet.”



This part of an old storage bunker — which were referred to as “concrete magazines” — is located to the left of the ninth hole rough. Superintendent Dennis Roque says the feature comes into play quite often.



Railroad tracks to the left of the No. 10 tee. “This railway took supplies or workers to all parts of the property” says Home Course superintendent Dennis Roque. “This short piece of track is all that remains of the railway. You have to pass through it to get to the white and blue tees on No. 10.” Photos courtesy of Dennis Roque

Five years ago the Washington State Department of Ecology announced The Home Course had been removed from the Hazardous Sites List formally recognizing an effective cleanup.

Oh traces of the bygone era remain. Bricks that were removed from a power station on the land have been installed between some tee boxes. If a golfer pipes a drive on the 15th tee to the right side of the large fairway mound that has remnants from the explosives manufacturing area buried beneath it the result can be a hefty bounce that advances the ball even farther.

The Home Course has certainly come a long way. “They’ve taken it and made it better” says former DuPont Mayor Michael Grayum. “Dennis and his staff are top-notch. Having the USGA come is icing on the cake.”

Allyson Brooks Ph.D. director/officer for the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historical Preservation says “It’s an interesting place for a golf course. It has such a wealth of history.”

Roque was introduced to the industry as a caretaker of research plots at Washington State University. Later he arrived as an assistant at The Home Course in 2008 where he was mentored by then-superintendent Kelly Donaldson. In 2014 Roque became superintendent. He tells a story about a former maintenance employee who swears he saw a ghost on the first hole several years ago. Initially Roque was skeptical. Now? Not so much. “Since I got here 13 years ago and began to delve into the history I’m not completely surprised” he says.

Although he hasn’t seen a ghost himself Roque does sense the presence of something truly special with the USGA championship happening soon. And he’s having an absolute blast. “Coming off a crazy year this is huge” Roque says. “The grind is hard but it’s worth it. It definitely has become quite the place here.”

The action comes after the company faced backlash online and revealed that it hadn't received permission from the artist who created the image back in 2014.

The phone case had been advertised as a new product and was being sold for $1.50 before screenshots of the phone case were posted online and sparked criticism from customers. Shein's website no longer has the item listed.



Jayunna Williams a 21-year-old from Oklahoma who posted the screenshots of the product said it was ""disturbing"" to find the case being sold online. Williams had been searching for a phone case on the Shein website after the retailer was recommended to her by friends.

""I don't know if it's supposed to be a dead man but who even gave the company permission to put this on their site?"" Williams said to BuzzFeed News. ""Why would someone at the company even approve that? It rubbed us the wrong way especially people in the Black community. We're really shocked because we put our money into companies like this and it's a big a slap in the face.""

Shein did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment. But in an initial response to customers on Twitter about the phone case Shein said that the artwork was ""created in reaction to the 2014 murder of Michael Brown"" to ""show support for [the Black Lives Matter movement].""

Customers quickly called the company out for the explanation. ""A white hand.. doing a chalk outline of a black person laying there (presumably de*d) in handcuffs and this was supposed to show support?? How? QUICKLY"" one user asked the company on Twitter.

The company apologized in a response to Williams' tweet saying that she ""brought to our attention that the art is being interpreted as racist"" and that it was ""contrary"" to its actual meaning.

In another tweet to Williams Shein revealed that it hadn't actually received permission from the artist Jean Jullien who posted the image on Instagram in response to the police shooting of Michael Brown a Black 18-year-old in 2014.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9kZXMtbW9pbmVzLW1lZGljYWwtc3RhZmZpbmctZmlybS1maW5kcy1zdWNjZXNzLWFtaWQtcGFuZGVtaWMtZGVtYW5kLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLW9wZW5sb29wLWpvbi1sZW5zaW5nLzcyNDI3MjgwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Des Moines health staffing firm finds success amid pandemic demand,"No commitment required.

But on the top of the shoe is the Xhosa word uluntu. It’s a language spoken by millions of members of one of South Africa’s largest ethnic groups. Adidas described the word as meaning “human race” though commenters on Twitter said it more accurately translates to “community.” Either way the community the sneaker drew its inspiration from was excluded from a chance to buy it incurring the disapproval of some in South Africa.

Update (June 3): In response to media coverage Adidas said it will make the shoe available to purchase in limited quantities online in South Africa beginning June 12.

Artificial scarcity in the sneaker business

The shoe is part of a series of sneakers Adidas has made with Williams embroidered with words from different languages. The company typically sells them in limited quantities through select retail partners and its Confirmed app which is only offered in certain countries. Generally these aren’t mass launches where anyone who wants a pair can get them. It’s a common distribution strategy in the sneaker business where desire for a product tends to rise with its exclusivity but by not making them available in South Africa Adidas stumbled onto the wrong side of an issue that has received growing attention in the fashion industry.

Cultural appropriation in the fashion industry

In recent years global corporations have been criticized for exploitative cultural appropriation where they borrow from a culture especially indigenous or disadvantaged ones without including it in the process or profits. The situation can be complicated when a designer is trying to show appreciation for a culture but often it amounts to a company turning a cultural group’s heritage into a way to make money without so much as consulting it.

Some groups have been pushing back. Maasai people in Kenya and Tanzania have sought to prevent companies from using their distinctive patterns without a licensing agreement. Mexico’s government has gone after companies co-opting the designs of its indigenous groups.

But companies are being warned they need to be more thoughtful in how they take inspiration from a culture. In Adidas’s case that just means at least giving the community that inspired its sneaker the opportunity to buy it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvbGlmZXN0eWxlL21hcnlsYW5kLWNhbmR5LWNvbXBhbnktY29va2luZy11cC1jaG9jb2xhdGUtY292ZXJlZC1jaWNhZGFzLTEuNTQzOTY2NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maryland candy company cooking up chocolate covered cicadas,"A Maryland candy company is selling chocolate covered cicadas to celebrate the emergence of the noisy insects that have spent the last 17 years underground.

Chouquette Chocolates is selling the cicadas -- dipped in either milk or dark chocolate -- online but it also posted the recipe on its Facebook page for brave chefs looking for something to do with the bugs.

Billions of cicadas from Brood X are emerging from their subterranean homes as temperatures warm up in the eastern United States. They'll spend the final days of their lives mating and making a tremendous racket as males work to attract females.

It's is expected to be the largest emergence event since 2004.

The fresh cicadas are frozen given a quick dip in boiling water then coated in oil and spices before being air fried and dropped in chocolate according to the instruction video. The video showed containers of cinnamon and Old Bay (because Maryland) but the post said to use whatever spice you like.

Chouquette Chocolates owner Sarah Dwyer told CNN affiliate WBAL that the end result tastes like chocolate covered potato chips.

""It's really crunchy because we air-fry them"" she told WBAL.

Dwyer is also selling other cicada-themed chocolates that are insect-free for people who want to enjoy the bugs without eating them.

""I just thought the whole idea of having cicadas around every 17 years it's fascinating"" she told WBAL.

Dwyer isn't the only one serving up cicadas.

University of Tennessee professor Jerome Grant told CNN affiliate WVLT that you can boil the bugs or roast them and he cooked them up in a stir fry and made street tacos.

The purchase price which was exceptionally high in the post-1987-crash era could only be justified if Fay Richwhite & Co continued to achieve strong profit growth.

Capital Markets chairman Laurie Stevens strongly supported the acquisition and told shareholders he was “more than satisfied with the deal based on the quality of earnings of the merchant bank incorporating Fay Richwhite and the track record of the banking world champions Michael Fay and David Richwhite”.

Although we didn’t know it at the time Fay Richwhite’s earnings were highly dependent on European Pacific Investments which later featured strongly in the Winebox Inquiry into tax dodges.

European Pacific Investments

European Pacific Investments (EPI) which was the brainchild of David Richwhite and Brierley Investments’ CEO Paul Collins was incorporated in Luxembourg on Sept 24 1986 with 25000 shares.

Its share capital and shareholdings then evolved as follows:

Just over two months after incorporation on Dec 4 EPI’s share capital was increased to 25m shares through the issue of new shares at US$2 ($3.85).

The company now had 25m shares on issue with Capital Markets and Brierley Investments (BIL) holding 12.5m shares each.

Shortly after Dec 4 Capital Markets and BIL sold 3.5m shares each to the BNZ at $8.85 a share.

The two original shareholders then sold an additional 2m shares each to the New Zealand public at $11.85 a share through an IPO.

Following these transactions EPI listed on the NZX in early Jan 1987 with Capital Markets BIL and the BNZ holding 7m shares or 28% each and the New Zealand public 4m shares or 16%.

Capital Markets and BIL had identified two gullible investors – the BNZ and the New Zealand public – which enabled both of them to make a profit of $33.5m on their EPI holdings in less than a month.

Shortly after these transactions Peter Travers – who was in charge of the BNZ’s corporate banking division which had suffered heavy losses in New Zealand and Australia – joined the EPI board.

There was no New Zealand IPO prospectus although a vague corporate profile released at the time contained the following statement: “EPI has recognised the demand for the provision of through one specialist organisation an international network combining trustee and banking services” and “to date activities have been based in the Cook Islands”.

EPI owned 100% of Cook Islands Trust Corporation and European Pacific Banking Corporation Cook Islands.

Rapid advances in banking technology and the abolition of foreign exchange controls by finance minister Roger Douglas in 1984 had created the opportunity for complex international tax transactions and the Cook Islands became a major destination for these deals.

At the individual level New Zealanders could borrow money at home with the interest costs tax deductible and then transfer the money from New Zealand through numerous tax havens including the Cook Islands and then back to New Zealand under a foreign entity.

This money was then invested in New Zealand under the foreign name with minimal New Zealand tax payable because of the foreign ownership structure.

This strategy was particularly attractive in 1986 and 1987 when New Zealand interest rates were 20% and higher and when interest costs were tax deductible and minimal tax was deducted on interest paid to foreign entities.

Large corporate tax deals were far more complex as demonstrated by the Magnum transaction in the Winebox Inquiry but similar principles prevailed.

EPI with its major activities based in the Cook Islands was a tax-dodge company that played a major role in these complex international tax transactions which peaked between mid-1984 and April 1988.

An excerpt from the EPI 1986 prospectus.

NZX listing

EPI listed on the NZX on Jan 6 1987 as an overseas company and quickly became the hot stock of the new year. Seven days after listing it reached an all-time high of $40 compared with its $11.85 IPO price and it was one of the 10 largest NZX companies by market value.

However none of the major shareholders were in a hurry to associate themselves with EPI even though it was major market success.

BNZ’s Feb 1987 IPO prospectus had a one-line reference to EPI and contained no details of the cost of this investment which was $62 million.

Brierley Investments made no reference to the Cook Islands-based company in its 1987 annual report even though EPI made a material contribution to its earnings through the sale of shares to BNZ and the New Zealand public.

Capital Markets gave a little more coverage to EPI with David Richwhite noting: “As New Zealand-based companies continue to move more towards international operations utilisation of offshore operations will increase opening up further opportunities for European Pacific.”

However this optimism was short lived as the New Zealand government was taking steps to close the tax loopholes that had benefited EPI its clients and shareholders.

New laws governing the control of foreign companies owned by New Zealand residents were introduced in early 1988 and EPI sold a 51% interest in its Cook Islands trust and banking operations to David Lloyd EPI’s managing director.

These tax changes and other changes that followed had a negative impact on EPI’s profitability and share price. In Oct 1989 a company associated with Lloyd acquired the Capital Markets BNZ and public shareholding for US$2.55 ($4.25) a share and EPI delisted from the NZX on Nov 20 1989.

EPI public shareholders lost $30m from the company’s short stay on the NZX and the BNZ lost $32m. By contrast Capital Markets made a profit of $36m.

Fay Richwhite profitability

As the Winebox Inquiry unfolded in the mid-1990s it became increasingly clear that the Fay Richwhite group of companies had been heavily dependent on tax-driven deals particularly through the Cook Islands.

These deals were structured in a way that income would continue to flow to Fay Richwhite for a number of years after these complex tax structures had been established and tax loopholes closed.

The purchase of Fay Richwhite by Capital Markets in 1990 and the profit forecasts contained in the takeover documents highlighted this issue.

The following graph shows the combined banking profits of Capital Markets and Fay Richwhite from 1987 to 1990 and the forecasts for the new merged company and the actual outcomes from 1991 to 1994.

These banking profits which are before interest on acquisition borrowing goodwill tax and dividends from associate companies declined dramatically after the 1990 Capital Markets/Fay Richwhite merger both in absolute terms and compared to forecasts issued at the time of the 1990 merger.

Fay Richwhite & Co was presented to Capital Markets shareholders as a growing and prosperous business in 1990 yet it is clear from these figures that its earnings had already peaked and it was in long-term decline.

Stevens Capital Markets’ chairman made wildly exaggerated claims when he referred to Michael Fay and David Richwhite as “banking world champions”.

Fay Richwhite's Mark Dunphy Guy Williams and Bill Birnie. End of 1990

As 1990 came to an end the listed company had changed its name from Capital Markets to Fay Richwhite and two new directors Bill Birnie and Guy Williams had been appointed to the board which now consisted of Stevens (chairman) Fay Richwhite Robin Congreve Geoff Ricketts Birnie and Williams.

Fay Richwhite was loaded with debt its traditional earnings were declining and it remained a major shareholder in the BNZ which was facing yet another crisis.

Postscript

On Aug 29 1990 the day Capital Markets approved the acquisition of Fay Richwhite & Co for $225m Capital Markets had a market value of $150m – a combined value of $375m.

In 1995 Eltham Holdings which was 78% owned by Michael Fay and David Richwhite made a successful bid for Fay Richwhite & Co and the company delisted on June 16 that year.

The Eltham offer valued Fay Richwhite & Co at $255m well below the $375m value five years earlier even though the listed company had acquired 29.4% of Tranz Rail from the crown at a favourable price in the interim period.

Hospital-level care at home—some of it provided over the Internet—is poised to grow after more than a decade as a niche offering boosted both by hospitals eager to ease overcrowding during the pandemic and growing interest by insurers who want to slow health care spending. But a host of challenges remain from deciding how much to pay for such services to which kinds of patients can safely benefit.

Under the model patients with certain medical conditions such as pneumonia or heart failure—even moderate COVID—are offered high-acuity care in their homes with 24/7 remote monitoring and daily visits by medical providers.

In the latest sign that the idea is catching on two big players—Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic—announced plans this month to collectively invest $100 million into Medically Home a Boston-based company that provides such services to scale up and expand their programs. The two organizations estimate that 30% of patients currently admitted to hospitals nationally have conditions eligible for in-home care. (KHN is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.)

Several other well-known hospital systems launched programs last summer. They join about two dozen already offering the service including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore Presbyterian Healthcare Services in New Mexico and Massachusetts General Hospital.

But hospitals have other financial considerations that are also part of the calculation. Systems that have built sparkling new in-patient facilities in the past decade floating bonds and taking out loans to finance them need patients filling costly inpatient beds to repay lenders and recoup investments.

And “hospitals that have surplus capacity whether because they have newly built beds or shrinking populations or are losing business to competitors are not going to be eager about this” said Dr. Jeff Levin-Scherz co-leader of the North American Health Management practice at consultancy Willis Towers Watson.

Medicare gave the idea a boost in November when it agreed to pay for such care to help keep non-COVID patients out of the hospital during the pandemic. Since then more than 100 hospitals have been approved by Medicare to participate although not all are in place yet.

Tasting opportunity Amazon and a coalition of industry groups in March announced plans to lobby for changes in federal and state rules to allow broader access to a wide range of in-home medical services.

“We’re seeing tremendous momentum” said Dr. Bruce Leff a Johns Hopkins Medical School geriatrician who has studied and advocated for the hospital-at-home approach since he helped establish one of the nation’s first programs in the mid-1990s.

Leff and other proponents say various studies show in-home care is just as safe and may produce better outcomes than being in the hospital and it saves money by limiting the need to expand hospitals reducing hospital readmissions and helping patients avoid nursing home stays. Some estimates put the projected savings at 30% over traditional hospital care. But ongoing programs are a long way from making a dent in the nation’s $1.2 trillion hospital tab.

While the goal is to shift 10% or more of hospital patients to home settings existing programs handle far fewer cases sometimes serving only a handful of patients.

“In a lot of ways this remains aspirational; this is the early innings” said Dean Ungar who follows the insurance and hospital industries as a vice president and senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service. Still he predicted that “hospitals will increasingly be reserved for acute care [such as surgeries and ICUs].”

Challenges to scaling up include maintaining the current good safety profile in the face of rapid growth and finding enough medical staff—especially nurses paramedics and technicians—who travel to patients’ homes.

The attraction for insurers is clear: If they can pay for care in a lower-cost setting than the hospital with good outcomes they save money.

For hospitals “the financials of it are frankly a little tough” said Levin-Scherz.

Those most attracted to hospital-at-home programs run at or near capacity and want to free up beds.

Even so Gerard Anderson a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health said hospitals likely see the potential long term for “huge profit margins” through “saving a lot of capital and personnel expense by having the work done at home.”

But Anderson worries that broad expansion of hospital-at-home efforts could exacerbate health care inequities.

“It’s realistic in middle- and upper-middle-class households” Anderson said. “My concern is in impoverished areas. They may not have the infrastructure to handle it.”

Suburban and rural areas—and even some lower-income urban areas—can have spotty or nonexistent Internet access. How will that affect the ability of those areas to participate to communicate with physicians and other hospital staff members miles away? Proponents outline solutions from providing patients with “hot spot” devices that provide Internet service along with backup power and instant communication via walkie-talkie-type handsets and computer tablets.

Social factors play a big part too. Those who live alone may find it harder to qualify if they need a lot of help while those in crowded households may not have enough room or privacy.

Another possible wrinkle: Not all patients have the necessary human support such as someone to help an ill patient with the bathroom meals or even answering the door.

That’s why both patients and their caregivers should get a detailed explanation of the day-to-day responsibilities before agreeing to participate said Alexandra Drane CEO of Archangels a for-profit group that works with employers and provides resources for unpaid caregivers.

“I love the concept for a resourced household where someone can take this job on” said Drane. “But there’s a lot of situations where that’s not possible. What If I have a full-time job and two children when am I supposed to do this?”

The programs all say they aim to reduce the burden on families. Some provide aides to help with bathing or other home care issues and provide food. None expects family members to perform medical procedures. The programs supply monitoring and communication equipment and a hospital bed if needed.

“We see the patient in their home setting” said Morre Dean president of Adventist Health’s hospital at home program which serves a broad area of California and part of Oregon. “What is in their refrigerator? What is their living situation? Can we impact that? We aren’t reliant on the family to deliver care.”

Patients are typically visited in their homes daily by various health workers. Physicians make home visits in some programs but most employ doctors to oversee care from remote “command centers” talking with patients via various electronic gadgets.

All of that was delivered to James Clifford’s home in Bakersfield California after he opted to participate in the Adventist program so he could leave the hospital and finish treatment for an infection at home. It required coordination—his wife had to be at their house for the set-up team even as she was scheduled to pick him up—but “once it was set up it worked well.”

At home he needed treatment with antibiotics every eight hours for several days and “one nurse came at 2 a.m.” said Clifford 70. “It woke up my wife but that’s OK. We had peace of mind by my being at home.”

Adventist launched its program a year ago but it hasn’t achieved the scale needed to save money yet said Dean. Ultimately he envisions the hospital-at-home option as “our biggest hospital in Adventist Health” with 500 to 1500 patients in the program at a time.

Medicare’s payment decision gave momentum to such goals. But the natural experiment it created with its funding ends when the pandemic is declared over. Because of the emergency Medicare paid the same as it would for in-hospital care based on each patient’s diagnosis. Will hospitals be as enthusiastic if that is not the case in the future? Commercial insurers are unlikely to pay unless they see lower rates since there are already concerns about overuse.

“From a societal perspective it’s great if these programs replace expensive inpatient care” said Levin-Scherz at Towers. But he said it would be a negative if the programs sought to grow by admitting patients who otherwise would not have gone into the hospital at all and could have been treated with lower-cost outpatient services.

As an Ohio family was seated at one of the top restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip the party of seven gazed over an extravaganza of fresh seafood on ice.

There was barbouni which was going for $62 a pound the king crab at $132 a pound and langoustine lobster which was also going for $132 a pound.

But the diners — Jeff Haupt and his family — were not only eating at Estiatorio Milos a Greek restaurant at the Venetian.

They were part of a 17-person restaurant excursion arranged by Lip Smacking Foodie Tours a local company started by entrepreneur and restaurant industry veteran Donald Contursi.

The Savors of the Strip afternoon tour one of several offered by the company takes guests on a walking tour of four Strip restaurants. For $125 participants get a sampling of food at each eatery.

On this day the stops also included the Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill and Smith & Wollensky both at the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian and Cipriani at Wynn Las Vegas.

The company also offers a variety of tours throughout the valley ranging in price from $125 to $799 for its “Ultimate Steakhouse Tour” which includes a stop at Bazaar Meat world-renowned chef Jose Andres spot at the Sahara.

From start to finish the Haupt’s tour lasted just under four hours.

Along with enjoying dishes like Smith & Wollensky’s angry shrimp and Sugarcane’s goat cheese croquette guests listened to a tour guide offer facts and stories about each resort and restaurant.

By the end there wasn’t an empty stomach or underwhelmed customer.

“It’s something that has really taken off” Contursi said.

Contursi 37 launched Lip Smacking Foodie Tours in 2014 after working for years as a server at a number of well-known restaurants in Las Vegas including Gordon Ramsay Steak at Paris Las Vegas.

Focused mostly on corporate groups at the outset the company which has five employees has branched out to cater to tourists and Las Vegas Valley residents.

In 2020 Contursi started a spinoff called Finger Licking Foodie Tours to offer self-guided experiences.

Contursi said he started the business because he loved food but was burned out working as a server. “I knew I had something special so I knew it would crush me if I didn’t do anything with it” he said.

Today it’s not uncommon for the businesses to entertain more than 100 people a day and that doesn’t count corporate groups which essentially disappeared during the pandemic Contursi said.

At Sugarcane the Haupt family and the rest of their tour group were whisked into the restaurant’s dining room seconds after arriving.

Plates of hamachi crispy rice with chives and truffle oil and bacon-wrapped dates came out a couple of minutes later.

Rodney Ignacio executive chef at Sugarcane said Lip Smacking Foodie Tours was a good way for the restaurant to advertise in a nontraditional way.

“It helps get the word out about something that people might not be used to” Ignacio said. “We’ll see people who come in after going on the tour wanting to get the full dish or full experience.”

Haupt whose daughter learned about the tours via TikTok said it was money well spent.

“We had a great time” Haupt said. “It’s a great way to experience some of these Las Vegas restaurants without having to put much effort into it.”

Contursi originally from the Chicago area followed his mother to Las Vegas nearly 20 years ago. He attended the College of Southern Nevada and UNLV before becoming a full-time server.

Lip Smacking recently introduced a self-guided deep-dish pizza tour in his hometown and was approached by Station Casinos to set up a tour at Green Valley Ranch which kicked off earlier this month.

“I’d like Lip Smacking Foodie Tours to go national” Contursi said. “It would be great to bring our product to other cities across the country.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtd2lsZC1tYXJjdXMtam9oYW5zc29uLXN1ZmZlcmVkLWJyb2tlbi1hcm0taW4tdGh1cnNkYXlzLWxvc3MvNjAwMDU5ODI1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild winger Marcus Johansson suffered broken arm in Thursday's loss,"The Wild has no choice but to switch up its lineup for Game 4 against the Golden Knights.

Forward Marcus Johansson suffered a broken left arm during the Wild's 5-2 loss in Game 3 on Thursday at Xcel Energy Center getting injured after crashing into the goalpost.

Johansson underwent surgery on Friday an NHL source said and there's no timeline for his return.

""He's clearly extremely disappointed but had awesome encouraging words about how we play and how we can play"" said coach Dean Evason who texted with Johansson on Friday morning. ""He's a big part of our team. Obviously we lose his speed factor a veteran presence. So yeah he'll be missed.""

Johansson was hurt early in the first period as he drove to the net from the right wing while Vegas' William Karlsson defended him. As Johansson cut inside he appeared to trip on the puck and collided with the post.

Although the 11-year NHL veteran was held pointless in the playoffs Johansson had been a fixture in the Wild's top-nine forward group skating on a line with Kevin Fiala and Victor Rask.

In 36 games during the regular season Johansson tallied six goals and eight assists while getting sidelined on the COVID list and sitting out with upper-body injuries. Acquired in an offseason trade that sent Eric Staal to the Sabres Johansson is in the final season of a two-year $9 million contract and it's possible he's played his last game with the Wild. The 30-year-old will be a free agent after the season.

""We're expecting when we put people into our lineup that they'll be able to hopefully provide us with some of the stuff that Jojo provides us with"" Evason said.

Zach Parise looks like the leading candidate to step in after being a healthy scratch for Games 1-3 but Evason didn't commit to playing the Wild's all-time leading playoff scorer.

""We're going to evaluate and make a decision"" Evason said.Even before the playoffs started Parise had become the Wild's extra forward — getting scratched for three of the last four games in the regular season. The winger was also benched earlier in the year for his play against the Golden Knights an overextended shift in a 5-4 overtime loss at Vegas on March 1.

Overall Parise had seven goals and 11 assists in 45 games while adapting to a new role on the fourth line that included less action on the power play. His average ice time finished at 13 minutes 57 seconds 3-plus minutes lower than last season and the lowest since his rookie season in 2005-06 (13:08). Evason said the team will mull different options for filling Johansson's vacancy and the Wild has plenty of reinforcements on standby.

Aside from taxi-squaders Luke Johnson Kyle Rau and Joseph Cramarossa the Wild recalled Matt Boldy Connor Dewar and Brandon Duhaime from the minors earlier this week. Boldy is the most intriguing of the bunch after the 2019 first-round draft pick picked up six goals and 12 assists in 14 games with Iowa in the American Hockey League after leaving Boston College in March to sign with the Wild and turn pro.

But Boldy has no NHL experience and a debut now would come at a make-or-break crossroads in the playoffs.

""All the players that are here and that are available to us are here for a reason"" Evason said. ""They can play. We've brought them here with the opportunity that if people get hurt or a situation that we play them. We feel very comfortable with every guy that's on our taxi squad that's played for us this year and we feel very comfortable with the people that we've brought up from Iowa. We feel very good about everybody.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3czNsdi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC92Z2stdGFrZXMtMy0xLWxlYWQtaW4tc3RhbmxleS1jdXAtcGxheW9mZi1zZXJpZXMtdnMtdGhlLXdpbGTSAV9odHRwczovL25ld3MzbHYuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3Znay10YWtlcy0zLTEtbGVhZC1pbi1zdGFubGV5LWN1cC1wbGF5b2ZmLXNlcmllcy12cy10aGUtd2lsZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VGK takes 3-1 lead in Stanley Cup playoff series vs the Wild,"Marc-Andre Fleury made 35 saves for his 16th career postseason shutout Nicolas Roy scored twice and the Vegas Golden Knights beat Minnesota 4-0 in Game 4 of the first-round playoff series on Saturday night to push the Wild to the verge of elimination.

Alex Tuch and Mark Stone each got their third goal of the series and Keegan Kolesar had two assists for the Golden Knights who have nine unanswered goals and lead 3-1 in the best-of-seven matchup. They get Game 5 at home on Monday night.

Joel Eriksson Ek had a goal challenged and erased by a replay review for the second straight game for the Wild whose other stars continued to be stymied by Fleury and his defensemen.

Kirill Kaprizov had only two shots on goal giving him eight in four games. Kevin Fiala who has no points in the series smashed his stick in frustration on the crossbar at a stoppage in play right after a couple of denials by Fleury in the third period.

Since the last time they advanced in 2015 the Wild are 2-10 in the playoffs at Xcel Energy Center. The Golden Knights hadn’t won here in regulation in their four-year history until Game 3.

The Wild made some line shuffles after a broken left arm in Game 3 forced out right wing Marcus Johansson. Zach Parise and Kyle Rau slotted in and Nick Bjugstad took a seat.

Parise who’s in the ninth season of his 13-year $98 million contract and the franchise leader in postseason goals appeared in the 102nd playoff game of his career after being scratched for the first three games against the speedy Golden Knights.

Parise was one of the five Wild skaters Roy blazed a trail past for the first goal in the first period of the series for Vegas. Roy had only one goal in 23 previous playoff games for the Golden Knights.

Kolesar was the flipper of the slick give-and-go pass at mid-ice that sent Roy on his way yet another player to show up on the scoresheet. Including Fleury who had an assist in Game 3 the Golden Knights have used 21 players in the series — and 16 of them have at least one point.

AFTER FURTHER REVIEW

Eriksson Ek who has been Minnesota’s best player of the series after a breakout regular season tied the game just 19 seconds later — until Vegas video coach Dave Rogowski struck again.

The challenge by the Golden Knights that Marcus Foligno was interfering with Fleury at the edge of the crease during Eriksson Ek’s shot was affirmed by the officials just as in Game 3 when Eriksson Ek’s goal was waved off. That one was disallowed because the Wild were deemed offside on the play and the Golden Knights praised Rogowski for his quick thinking to recommend the challenge to coach Peter DeBoer.

The boos from the 25% capacity crowd sounded as if they came from a full house. Midway through the second period when Tuch sliced between Wild defensemen Jared Spurgeon and Matt Dumba and deked Cam Talbot (14 saves) for the 2-0 lead the arena felt empty again like it was earlier in the season.

POWER OUTAGE

Parise was bloodied by a high stick from Zach Whitecloud a few minutes after Tuch’s goal for a double minor penalty.

Soon after the first one was killed Stone picked up a loose puck in the Minnesota zone and blew by Ryan Suter for the unassisted short-handed goal to put Vegas in firm control. The Wild fell to 0 for 8 on the power play in the series.

Hennepin County says maybe.,"The Hennepin County Board set ambitious goals last month for emission reduction and environmental resilience by approving its first climate action plan.

The state’s largest county aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and to reduce the large disparities in the way communities of color and low-income residents experience pollution. Net zero refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced (for instance through energy generation) and the amount removed from the atmosphere (through say reforestation or carbon sequestration).

The plan was created through a 16-month process involving 20 county departments multiple cities and watershed management organizations and a series of community feedback sessions and public online surveys. It hits many targets environmental activists were eager to see: expanding tree planting programs to reduce heat islands and improve air quality; reducing vehicle miles traveled to shrink transportation emissions by improving transit and pedestrian and bike infrastructure; and improving flood resilience in an increasingly wet Minnesota climate. But the plan offers no path toward closing a controversial Minneapolis trash incinerator that operates under county control.

Community and environmental groups have resisted the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC) since its construction in the North Loop neighborhood of Minneapolis in 1989. The HERC is a trash-to-energy incinerator that burns waste to create steam. That steam then generates electricity. The HERC produces enough electricity to power about 25000 homes which the county sells to Xcel Energy. It powers Target Field its nextdoor neighbor.

Incinerators produce toxic air pollutants with demonstrated links to asthma lung disease high blood pressure and heart disease. Environmental justice advocates have organized against the HERC for decades citing its location on the edge of downtown near north Minneapolis.

The HERC emits additional pollution on north Minneapolis a community where the majority of residents are people of color and an area already exposed to a disproportionate amount of air-borne toxins.

“People living close to these facilities are exposed through inhalation” said Marco Hernández public policy director with Communities Organizing Latinx Power and Action (COPAL).

COPAL fights to improve conditions for immigrants and people of color in Minnesota. Closing the HERC and other trash incinerators across the state is a focal point of its environmental organizing efforts.

County officials say the incinerator plays a useful role in trash management with lower emissions than standard landfills and cuts down on transportation pollution from hauling trash to exurban dumps.



Pollution source mislabeled as renewable energy?

Minnesota is one of 23 states that designates waste-to-energy burners a source of renewable energy. The classification means the facilities qualify for publicly funded subsidies. That’s a mistake climate scientists say.

Sintana Vergara an environmental resources engineering professor at Humboldt State University in California said renewable energy comes from naturally occurring ever-present sources like the sun and wind. There’s nothing natural about burning trash she said.

“The bottom line is that you’re burning” Vergara said. “And whenever you burn stuff you’re going to have air pollution”

The facilities are major producers of carbon dioxide and particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5). These are essentially tiny toxic inhalable particles stemming from various chemical sources often produced by burning. Incinerators are also known to produce high levels of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides which are harmful to human respiratory systems air clarity and plant life.

The HERC is a pollution source in Minneapolis. It produced 173254 tons of carbon dioxide 404 tons of nitrogen oxide and 21 tons of PM2.5 in 2019 according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Those pollution levels are lower than amounts allowed by its operating permit from the state.

COPAL helped push through an amendment that reclassified the HERC as non-renewable energy source in a pending Minnesota House of Representatives bill calling for 100 percent of electricity to come from renewable energy by 2040. That bill has an uncertain future in the upcoming special Legislative session and faces a tough road through a Republican-led state senate.

The organization opposes all incinerators in the state but found the most political support this year to reclassify the HERC Hernández said. COPAL plans to increase campaign efforts against incinerators in greater Minnesota in the future.

Disproportionate Impact

Waste-to-energy incinerators rose to prominence in the late 1970s in the United States. The nation was emerging from an energy crisis and looking for alternative to oil Vergara explained.

“We started by siting these incinerators in poor communities and communities of color and unsurprisingly they became very unpopular” Vergara said.

Minnesota has seven incinerators the third most in the nation according to a 2020 report by The New School’s Tishman Environment and Design Center. There are 338454 people living within a three-mile radius of those incinerators. Six of the seven are in “environmental justice communities” a term that describes areas most exposed to environmental hazards with increased vulnerability to those risks which the study classifies based on demographic and income data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

“It’s not just the HERC it’s all the incinerators across the state it’s where they’re located” Leslee Gutiérrez COPAL’s environmental justice organizer said.

COPAL hosted an Earth Day celebration at George Floyd Square in south Minneapolis this year. When they talked about their work against incinerators “people clapped and agreed” Hernández said.

The Hennepin County climate action plan recognizes that communities of color are more likely to be exposed to major pollution sources and breathe worse air.

“There are areas of the county that feel air quality impacts and bear that burden in disproportionate ways” said Rosemary Lavin Hennepin County director of environment and energy.

One of those areas is north Minneapolis an area criss-crossed by major highways and Interstate 94 and which also holds many polluting industrial sites near the Mississippi River. The plan calls for reducing vehicle miles traveled in Hennepin County by expanding mass transit and improving bike and pedestrian infrastructure. The county is also pursuing waste reduction strategies to cut down on pollution.

Gaps between the environmental movement and the environmental justice movement

The HERC is a better way to manage waste than traditional landfilling Lavin told Sahan Journal. Landfills are major sources of methane a potent greenhouse gas. The county needs to manage a lot of waste much of it organic and food waste.

“Until we remove a significant amount of that food waste material the HERC is a more efficient way of managing that food waste” Lavin said.

The county wants to move to zero waste she said.

Many raised concerns about the HERC during the climate-action-plan process Lavin said. The county has heard those comments for years she said.

“I don’t want to dismiss the concerns we hear from the community” she said.

Lavin sees “a bit of a disconnect” in the way environmental groups view the HERC and the facility’s pollution impact. The HERC produces just 0.2 percent of air pollution in Hennepin County she said. The incinerator processes waste closer to where it is produced cutting down on transportation emissions—that is the truck exhaust to move that waste farther away. And the county reclaims a significant amount of scrap metal at the facility.

Environmental groups say it’s less about HERCs overall environmental impact and more about who feels it. Much of it comes down to class Hernández said with wealthier people less likely to live near incinerators.

“It’s just a matter of prioritization and putting your money where your mouth is but they’re not” said Nazir Khan an organizer with the Minnesota BIPOC Environmental and Climate Justice Table a Twin Cities based nonprofit organization.

Incinerators are a primary target of BIPOC Table organizing. The group sees a gap between the larger environmental movement and the environmental justice movement which seeks to improve conditions for those facing the brunt of pollution and climate change:low-income people and communities of color.

The group participated in the climate action plan where many raised critiques about the HERC. Khan wasn’t surprised that it offered no timeline for shutting the facility.

“The county views the HERC as an asset for fighting climate change” Khan said.

For the county the goal shouldn’t be closing the HERC Lavin said but reducing waste to the point where it’s unnecessary.

Moving to zero waste

Climate activists largely agree with the county on that point but want to see a more concrete plan to get to zero waste.

“We have to raise the temperature on the HERC not just to shut it down but to win a zero-waste plan” Khan said.

To become zero waste “we basically have to stop using landfills” Vergara said. Today more than 50 percent of U.S. waste goes to landfills. The Twin Cities metro area set a goal to recycle 75 percent of its waste but around half still goes to landfills according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Hennepin County aims to recycle 75 percent of its waste by 2030.

The biggest challenge Vergara said may be unlearning modern consumption habits common in developed countries. Vergara a first generation Colombian American said poorer nations tend to do much better at reusing items.

Cities can accomplish landfill diversion through recycling traditional materials like paper and glass and organic materials such as food scraps and wood.

To get there recycling and organic recycling must be expanded. Organic recycling is the recycling of food scraps and other compostable items that are disintegrated down into compost that is reused as fertile soil. About 18 percent of waste in Minnesota landfills are organic materials according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

Hennepin County has expanded its organic recycling program in recent years. Today Minneapolis has curbside organics recycling as do most large cities in the county. The county requires all municipalities with more than 10000 residents to offer curbside organics recycling by 2022 with drop off sites in smaller towns. The county ordinance required large sources of food waste like restaurants and grocers to begin organics recycling in 2020.

The rate of organics recycling is on the rise but no curbside option exists for residents of multifamily buildings with more than four units. Food waste from those residences remains a big issue Lavin said. Making it easier for people living in larger apartment buildings to recycle organically is a priority she said.

Expanding that program and moving towards zero waste would be a major step to closing the HERC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xkZW5rbmlnaHRzL2ZydXN0cmF0aW9ucy1tb3VudC1hcy13aWxkLXNodXQtb3V0LWJ5LWdvbGRlbi1rbmlnaHRzLTIzNjEyMDcv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2dvbGRlbmtuaWdodHMvZnJ1c3RyYXRpb25zLW1vdW50LWFzLXdpbGQtc2h1dC1vdXQtYnktZ29sZGVuLWtuaWdodHMtMjM2MTIwNy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frustrations mount as Wild shut out by Golden Knights,"The Minnesota Wild have a three-game losing streak for the first time this season and trail the Golden Knights 3-1 in their NHL playoff series.

Even the pucks that go in the net aren’t resulting in goals for the Minnesota Wild.

That just about sums up how it’s going for a team that dropped its third straight game for the first time this season and trails its first-round playoff series 3-1 to the Golden Knights after a 4-0 loss Saturday at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul Minnesota.

“It’s frustrating” forward Kevin Fiala said of an attack that has generated just four goals in four games despite registering plenty of shots on goal. “It’s not just the shots. I feel like it’s great opportunities that aren’t going in. So yeah what can I say?”

Teammate Joel Eriksson Ek is one of the few Wild players who has been able to put the puck past Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury but he had a goal disallowed by a challenge for the second straight game.

On Saturday it was a first period blast that would have tied the game seconds after the Knights had taken the lead. Coach Pete DeBoer successfully challenged again.

“It would have been good for us to get that goal but it’s something we have to push through” Eriksson Ek said. “We have to get back to our game. We can’t let those things affect us. We can’t do anything about it. When it’s done it’s done. We have to come together to work even harder for a new goal.”

It never came despite the Wild putting 35 shots on goal and creating 14 high-danger chances while allowing eight.

“We’re getting those quality looks” Wild coach Dean Evason said. “Obviously Fleury has been phenomenal. But we were getting the same looks against great goaltenders all year and were able to score. We’re just not finding the net. We’re likely not putting enough there and likely not simplifying but you say that and you look at the shots and our quality of chances we should be able to score a few more goals.”

The Wild know they are running out of time to change that.

They will head to T-Mobile Arena for Game 5 on Monday facing elimination an outcome that is certain if Minnesota is unable to score goals.

Fiala who had six shots Saturday and 18 in the series without recording a point still believes in his team’s ability to create offense but he knows they can’t obsess over the first four games.

“It’s frustrating but it’s Game 5 now” he said. “We have to let this go. I’m confident we are going to score including myself. I still feel like I’m going to get it done. I had a great chance today again. Fleury won it for them today again. We take it game by game and shift by shift and we won’t give up.”

Minnesota also must get more out of a power play that is 0-for-8 in the series against the NHL’s top-rated unit. The Wild had a prime chance in the second period Saturday with a four-minute power play because of a double-minor penalty but allowed a short-handed goal to Mark Stone that put the Knights in control.

Several Wild players credited the Knights’ efforts in front of Fleury to block shots and disrupt lanes to the net. They promise a commitment to get more pucks to the crease and bodies in front to pounce on rebounds but they have had more than 240 minutes on the ice and yet to consistently execute such a strategy.

“You’re always frustrated when a goalie is playing like that playing on his head” forward Marcus Foligno said. “You really can’t do much but keep shooting. We’ve been a resilient group all year and that’s got to be the mindset for next game. Maybe having that desperation in our game going into Vegas is what we need. It’s tough to drop two especially when we’ve been so good at home. But playoffs is playoffs and we’ve just got to win one game.”

He and fellow Vegas defenseman Alec Martinez cracked each other up throughout Friday's video news conference having fun during an obligation that can be drudgery for some athletes.

""I would like to give a shout out to this guy"" Martinez said. ""He said it was fun last night. I think it's only fitting that he's wearing his Disney Goofy shirt right now in a press conference. Nice.""

Such is life for the Golden Knights after their 5-2 victory over the Wild on Thursday night at Xcel Energy Center gave them a 2-1 lead in the West Division first-round playoff series.

Winning of course lightens the mood and Holden was taking full advantage.

Playing in his first game since April 9 Holden drew into the Vegas lineup as third-pair defenseman and made his coach Peter DeBoer look like a genius. Holden who played only 17 games in the regular season assisted on Patrick Brown's tying goal and Reilly Smith's winner as the Golden Knights rallied from two goals down to beat the Wild.

""I have to say it was fun"" Holden said. ""Coaches and training staff have done a good job of making sure that I was ready physically. I'm comfortable with my game so being able to get in it was just fun to be able to be back out there and competing.""

Sensing fatigue in regular third-pair blue-liner Nicolas Hague DeBoer opted for Holden on Thursday. Throughout the season Holden 34 was a salary cap casualty being placed on waivers and sitting in favor of Hague because Hague carried a smaller cap hit.

""We haven't been able to put him in even when there's been opportunity for him"" DeBoer said. ""Veteran guy understood it kept working never complained. I wanted to get him in. We're going to need seven or eight defensemen.""

Added Martinez ""He truly is a consummate professional. He's been dealt a hand this year with all the cap things that is a pretty difficult situation to be confronted with.""

Holden who re-signed with Vegas in the offseason on a two-year $3.4 million contract understands and accepts his role.

""It's probably been the most interesting [season] of my career"" he said. ""Being able to stay ready stay engaged has been pretty easy for me this year just by not being able to play a ton of games. … I'm comfortable in my game. I wasn't too concerned jumping in not having played in a while.""

At home on the road

Through Thursday road teams held a 10-8 record in the NHL playoffs. DeBoer credits that to home-ice advantage not being as important as it once was.

""There definitely is a piece of the pressure that home teams put on themselves to win those games. I think it's easier to play on the road. This year it's even easier because you're not going into really hostile environments with 20000 people in the stands.""

Patching the lineup

Max Pacioretty the Golden Knights leading goal-scorer in the regular season with 24 hasn't played since May 1 because of an undisclosed injury and remains a game-time decision in this series. DeBoer has been impressed how his team has handled Pacioretty's absence.

""Whether it's been short lineups or injuries or COVID it's just been next man up and get to work"" he said. ""Obviously Patches that's a big hole for us. You take anyone's leading goal-scorer out of their lineup and it changes the identity of that team. He's a goal-a-game guy. Whether he's scoring it or helping create it that's what he is."""

At £20 this is worth investigating when you’re caught short on headphones. But are they passable for day-to-day use?

What do you get for £20?

We’ve all seen the Wish adverts for knock-off EarPods with no-name Bluetooth headphones coming down in price fast. But Flying Tiger tends to have some rather interesting products.

Including these.

Wireless in-ear pod earphones for £20 all in. You can get them in green black or white. I went for the green ones because… well. I had no good reason other than they are not black or white.

In terms of rated battery life:

Earphones: 3 hours playback/8 hours standby

Case: 1-day standby

Charging time 1-hour charge for earphones and case.

These won’t win awards for long-haul flights (and the Apple product is nearer 5 hours of life) but then you have to factor these earphones 1/6th the cost of AirPods.

So let’s unbox!

In the box we have:

The in-ear headphones

Instructions

Charging cable and ear tips

Let’s flip the earphone case open.

Well those look like wireless earphones. No particular flair but they look like… wireless earphones

The instructions look easy enough if covering a lot of languages.

However they miss one little thing: remove the plastic separating the earphone from the charger back. That was a few minutes of confusion. However once the plastic was gone the buds started charging up.

Oh yes. They use USB-C to charge meaning you can use your (modern) laptop charger to charge them with.



The charging LED’s are now alive!

With us being in 2021 – like it or not it is welcoming to see

Once there was a bit of charge I was able to pair without issue. As these are generic as heck I had to pair them via the Bluetooth menu on my iPhone. Your device may vary where things are.

Comfort and Fit

With three sets of tips (small medium and large) I tried the basic medium tips. They seemed to do a good fit and seal – to the point they were very good at sound isolation… too good in fact when I had them in and couldn’t hear someone speak next to me.

If I’m out and about I vary between one earphone in or both. One in one out gives me a lot more situational awareness as these do not have a Transparency Mode on them.

Controls

The earbuds have capacitive touch controls

In theory it’s pretty simple. In practice they’re almost annoying with different controls for each earbud.

Probably the only control I used in anger was the tap to pause and tap to answer. I almost miss the cable dangling around the back of my neck with a physical controller.

But even then those aren’t exactly 100% reliable.

Range

The headphones are rated for use around 10 meters away from the device. This seemed accurate as I left the case and phone at my desk whilst pottering around one of the offices I’m based out.

Things like walls will get in the way of the signal – so be warned.

Your performance may vary. Bluetooth isn’t the greatest of protocols (however much it has improved over the years) and like most headphones bodies of water/mass won’t help in transmission (like for example a human body).

Audio tests

I’ve assembled a YouTube playlist of some of the tracks I test with – namely then you can compare them with your headphones or audio device.

It’s an eclectic mix – mostly actually lives on my iPhone for straight transfer to the audio device

The list is published on YouTube but for those who don’t want to click a link here is my list:

Crab Rave – Nordstrom

Keiino – Spirit in the Sky

Justified and Ancient – The KFL featuring Tammy Winnett

Rhapsody in Blue – Gary Graffman · New York Philharmonic Orchestra · George Gershwin (Manhattan film version)

Sands of Time – T.Stebbins/Sugano

On Her Majesty’s Secret Service – John Barry/The Propellerheads/David Arnold

Glorious – Andreas Johnson

Unfinished Sympathy – Massive Attack

Pompeii – Bastille

A Little Time – The Beautiful South

The Ball – Craig Armstrong

Creep – Scala and the Kolacny Brothers (cover of the Radiohead version).

I ran a lot of other stuff through this but I think I might damage the eardrums of some of you listen in.

So the earbuds are unsurprisingly base-heavy. But I think you guessed that.

Saying that the beats in the Justified and Ancient were nice and clear and not distorted.

Vocals were reasonably clear with Scala’s version of Creep being very clear (even if the recording has more than its fair share of hiss that wasn’t present in any other track that album).

Distortion was not much of a problem except when cranking up the volume to maximum. Saying that I had the earbuds on minimum volume most of the time – mainly as they were loud enough for travel on the bus and in the office when I needed to get on with stuff without disturbing people.

Stereo separation seemed rather solid with the introduction of “On Her Majesties Secret service” showing them off with the trumpets passing from ear to ear. Elenor Rigby by The Beatles shows audio is working right (with Paul McCarney’s solo coming clearly out of the right ear and the orchestra playing on the left (until you get to the words “all the lonely people” where it goes into stereo again).

Recording Quality/Call Quality

As usual your mileage will vary with the joy of Bluetooth. On the few calls I tested with people (both video and voice) the audio quality was clear

Impressive for the price

As headphones they’re reasonable enough quality They’re not going to blow you away with their simplicity of setup tight OS integration or some of the niceties that other headphones have.

Rather they’re a simple set of wireless earbuds that allow you to listen intact with you. They’ll take calls they’ll play music

Whilst the control schema is not what I’d call “good” it is passable enough to use on a day-to-day basis.

And looking at the price – £20 – they fall into the category of “pick up and go” rather than a considered purchase of Bose/Sony etc.

In cheap headphone money that’s at the bottom end of the market (I’ve tended to favour SkullCandy Bluetooth earphones in the past when travelling). These are very akin to those.

Except these are a lot easy to lose. Although my SkullCandy earphone retention rate isn’t exactly high…

Put it like this I’m driving these daily with minimal complaints. For £20 to listen to bad music on the go whilst not feeling that guilty if they get lost they’re impressive for the price.
