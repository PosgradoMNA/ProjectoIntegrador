Be Tory treasurer and donate £3m,"However others have raised concerns about the ethics of ennobling so many donors. Lord Jay who was chair of the Lords Appointments Commission between 2008 and 2013 spoke to The Sunday Times on donations: “When I was there I think it was probably less of a factor than it is now. But it has been a factor for a very long time.”

For years all political parties have insisted that appointments are made on the basis of experience not money and that the sheer number of donors in the Lords is pure coincidence. But openDemocracy’s figures show just how improbable those claims are.

“It’s become institutionalised that when you’ve done your stint as a Conservative Party treasurer the chances are you’ll be popped into the House of Lords” said one ex-minister.

One Tory donor told a Sunday Times source that he gave a million pounds to the party after being encouraged to do so by a party treasurer who suggested that it could lead to a seat in the House of Lords. He said the party was dangling peerages before donors like “carrots” and that everyone in the party was aware of the “cynical operation”.

But many insiders worry about the consequences of speaking out openly and claim the party has operated under a “law of Omertà” on the subject.

‘Appeared to be a reward’

Until now members of the House of Lords Appointments Commission have never talked publicly about the peerage given to Peter Cruddas last year. But one of them Lord Clark of Windermere now admits that the episode “left a bad taste in my mouth”. He was one of six commissioners who held a video meeting to discuss nominations last December assembled in a great hurry.

A source close to the commission elaborated on the time pressure put on its members over Crudas’s nomination: “The papers are coming from the Cabinet Office and they’ve got to be dealt with in days because the prime minister is always saying ‘I want to make these appointments I want to make these announcements.’

“There were very strong feelings in the commission about it. It just appeared to be a reward and [commissioners] didn’t feel it was right to be honest in view of the money he had given the Tories” they added. They suggested that the six commissioners – a retired bishop the Lord-Lieutenant of Belfast three peers nominated by the major political parties and a history professor – had been unanimous in voting to block Cruddas’s peerage.

Johnson was the first prime minister to overrule the commission arguing that Cruddas deserved a peerage as a “clear and rare exception” because of his contributions to business charity and politics. However Johnson did not address the commission’s concerns about Cruddas’s donations to the party.

Cruddas himself has said it is “definitely not true” that his peerage and donations were in any way linked adding: “That would be corruption and that's definitely not the case.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTAxNzMzMzMvVGF4cGF5ZXJzLWZvb3QtYmlsbC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXNwZW5kcy0zbS1yZXNlYXJjaC1wcm9ibGVtcy1wcmVnbmFudC1tZW4uaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwMTczMzMzL2FtcC9UYXhwYXllcnMtZm9vdC1iaWxsLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc3BlbmRzLTNtLXJlc2VhcmNoLXByb2JsZW1zLXByZWduYW50LW1lbi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taxpayers foot the bill as government spends £3m on research into problems of pregnant men,"The Government has spent more than £3 million on controversial transgender research including projects charting the experience of pregnant men and the fate of trans people in Lebanon.

A total of 13 such schemes some lasting up to four years have been uncovered in analysis by The Mail on Sunday.

They are funded by the UK Research and Innovation quango which is financed by the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to support academic investigations.

A King’s College London project called Reforming Legal Gender Identity: A Socio-Legal Evaluation which has been handed £579000 of Government cash over four years to look into issues such as birth certificates allowing more than two gender options or letting people to choose their own legal gender;

Transgender Romantic Relationships at Nottingham University given about £80000.

‘The current system rightly scrutinises projects throughout the application process but lacks effective measures to judge value for money on those that have already been funded.’

Labour is ramping up the pressure on sleaze amid reports the Conservative Party has been offering House of Lords peerages to wealthy benefactors as a “reward” for large donations.

The report by The Sunday Times and Open Democracy says wealthy benefactors “appear to be guaranteed a peerage if they take on the temporary role as the party treasurer and increase their own donations beyond £3 million.”

It also quoted party sources as saying that there is a “tradition” of Conservative prime ministers handing out peerages to the party’s treasurers.

There has also been widespread speculation at Westminster that Owen Paterson who quit as MP for North Shropshire on Thursday in the face of a suspension over “egregious” breaches of lobbying rules could himself be in line for a peerage.

Labour said the report highlighted a “cash for access culture” in the Tory party and Sir Keir Starmer has written to the body that considers nominations for peerages to argue that Mr Paterson should not be granted a peerage if Downing Street recommends him for one.

In a letter to Lord Bew chairman of the House of Lords Appointments Commission Sir Keir said it would “undermine confidence in the probity of Parliament” if Mr Paterson was made a Lord.

According to the Sunday Times report in the last two decades all 16 of the party’s treasurers – except the most recent– have been offered a seat in the House of Lords.

A further 22 of the party’s main financial backers who have given £54 million to the party between them including nine donor treasurers have also been offered seats since 2010 it said.

An ex-party chairman told the Sunday Times: “The truth is the entire political establishment knows this happens and they do nothing about it… The most telling line is once you pay your £3 million you get your peerage.”

However there is no suggestion any of the donors named in the investigation requested or were promised a peerage or were directed or offered to pay any particular sum to secure an honour.

On Saturday former prime minister Sir John Major said a peerage for Mr Paterson would be “rather extraordinary” as he launched a blistering attack on the “shameful” actions of Mr Johnson’s government arguing that they were “perhaps politically corrupt”.

An inquiry led by Kathryn Stone Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found Mr Paterson repeatedly lobbied on behalf of two companies paying him more than £100000 per year – Randox and Lynn’s Country Foods.

Mr Paterson quit after Mr Johnson abandoned a plan which would have seen his case – and the parliamentary standards regime – reviewed by a Tory-led committee.

Former minister Caroline Nokes – a prominent critic of the PM – has said in the Sunday Mirror: “If my postbag is anything to go by the public think the PM’s decision to circle his wagons and attack Kathryn Stone well and truly stinks. And it does.”

The Independent has reached out to the Conservative Party for comment. However a spokesman told The Sunday Times: “We do not believe that successful businesspeople and philanthropists who contribute to political causes and parties should be disqualified from sitting in the legislature.”"

DALLAS — Watch the story tonight on WFAA at 10.

While the science on climate change is unequivocal – that Texas will face a future of more extreme heat drought fire and hurricanes – Gov. Greg Abbott’s administration has no policy on how those risks will impact Texans or how to mitigate them.

Abbott’s position stands in stark contrast to agencies like the United States Department of Defense which considers climate change a ""threat multiplier"" to military operations and to the efforts of world leaders gathered at the United Nation’s COP26 Summit in Scotland to negotiate rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

More Extremes Ahead

In Texas at least 210 people died in the cold and dark during the February 2021 winter storm. It was the most expensive disaster in state history.

Like a set of dominoes the extreme cold created a cascading effect. For example when power plants froze that meant some water plants running on electricity did not have the power to pump water. Without water the National Guard resorted to airlifting bottles of water across the state.

A widely-reported paper in the journal Science indicates the domino that started the cascade was likely climate change. In it scientists draw a connection between climate change and the likelihood that arctic temperatures could sag all the way down to Texas.

“It's all tied together. Everybody has to worry about everything” said Dr. John Nielsen-Gammon a professor at Texas A&M University and the Texas State Climatologist talking about the risks of climate change.

Through his work Nielsen-Gammon has been warning state policymakers about those risks for years. His latest research indicates we're headed for a future of more extremes: more 100-degree days more extreme rainfall more urban flooding more intense hurricanes more severe drought more risk of wildfire.

Does he think that officials responsible for mitigating against future risk must consider climate change in their planning?

“If you're dealing with risk that is weather sensitive then yes” he said.

Planning for the Future of Texas

In 2011 Texas was hit with one of the worst droughts in history. Farmers and ranchers sustained $8 billion in losses 300 million trees died and it was the worst year for wildfires in state history.

How long did it take farmers to recover from that devastating year?

“It may be two years after the fact hopefully if things go well before you come back to even to recuperate what you lose in that year” said John Paul Dineen a farmer in Waxahachie.

So what is the state of Texas doing to prepare for future droughts?

Bois D'arc Lake in Fannin County is the first major new reservoir in Texas in 30 years. It takes a long time to develop a new water source like this. That’s one reason the state's water plan looks 50 years into the future.

The mission is to always have enough water in case of a drought that's as bad as the worst drought Texas has ever had called the drought of record.

But in a scientific research paper called Unprecedented Drought Challenges for Texas Nielsen-Gammon and others conclude because of climate change future droughts are likely to be worse than the drought of record.

Should the state be planning for that?

“I think they should” Nielsen-Gammon said. “You're basically assuming the droughts that occurred in the past are going to be similar to the droughts that occur in the future. That's not necessarily a good assumption.”

But the Texas Water Development Board whose commissioners are appointed by the governor has no policy on how climate change could impact the state's future water supply.

Chairwoman Brooke Paup declined to be interviewed for this story. However in a statement a representative wrote ""...planning groups and local water providers have the flexibility to consider balance and address a variety of potential risks and uncertainties including the risk of a drought worse than the drought of record.”

In other words helping Texans navigate the risks that climate change will pose to their water supply is not the board’s job.

On this week's episode of Y'all-itics David joined the Jasons to talk about the climate summit and the possible impacts for Texas.

Where Abbott’s Agencies Stand

We found the Water Board is one of 10 major state agencies -- all run by commissioners appointed by Abbott – that do not have a policy on how climate change impacts state operations.

Energy

More extreme temperatures will likely increase the demand for electricity according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It could also hamper how energy is produced and delivered as Texans saw last winter. But the Texas Public Utility Commission responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas has no policy on how climate change will impact the reliable energy Texans count on.

In a statement the PUC writes: “Texas has always had highly variable weather so there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However any policy decision needs to be made on sound science and data...”

Air Quality

Climate Change degrades air quality and increases ozone levels according to the EPA. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is responsible for maintaining air quality but has no policy on how climate change will impact the air Texans breathe.

In a statement the TCEQ writes it “…uses air monitoring data and a variety of other inputs to develop future projections for air quality in Texas. That said the agency does not use climate change projections to evaluate future impact on air quality.”

Disasters

Hurricanes heavy rain and heat are all made more intense by climate change according the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But the Texas Department of Emergency Management responsible for responding to disasters has no policy on how climate change will impact the disasters Texans will face.

In a statement TDEM writes that it “uses various professionals organizations and models to study weather and weather patterns that may impact Texas…” and “…takes an all-hazards approach to preparedness and is ready to respond to all disasters whether natural or manmade.”

Transportation

Guidance from several federal agencies says extreme rain heat and drought caused by climate change can disrupt transportation systems. The Texas Department of Transportation responsible for the state's roads and bridges says it takes steps to harden its assets against extreme weather conditions but it has no policy on how climate change will impact overall mobility in the future.

In a statement TXDOT writes it has “a combination of programs and projects that are adaptable and flexible to keep our system resilient to changing conditions of flooding sea-level rise extreme heat and drought. Some of these include: updating models and design standards for roads and bridges that are susceptible to extreme weather; efforts to reduce flooding soil erosion and water pollution; an investigation team that evaluates pavement affected by extreme heat and drought; and more consideration of extreme weather events during project design and maintenance activities.”

Health

Heat-related illness asthma and allergies are getting worse because of climate change according to the Centers for Disease Control. But the Texas Department of Health and Human Services responsible for improving the health safety and well-being of Texans has no policy on how climate change impacts that mission.

In a statement TDHHS writes it “does not consider climate change for our projections and we do not have a policy regarding climate change.”

Prisons

A report from Columbia University Law School finds climate change “will strain the already overburdened U.S. correctional system and imperil the health of inmates and penal employees alike…” The Texas Department of Criminal Justice which houses inmates and employs prison workers in facilities without air conditioning has no policy on how climate change impacts the agency’s mission.

In a statement the TDCJ writes it “…works closely with other state agencies on climate projections to make operational decisions” however none of the agencies it mentioned have a policy on climate change.

Parks

The National Parks Conservation Alliance says “climate change is the greatest threat the national parks have ever faced.” Texas Parks and Wildlife is responsible for managing and conserving the natural and cultural resources of Texas for future generations. When planning for the future TPWD says it does take into account environmental changes but it does not have a policy on how climate change impacts its mission.

In a statement TPWD writes it is “… continually reviewing how a dynamic climate impacts park lands for Texans especially since public use and outdoor recreation facilities are so connected to the natural environment. When planning for the future we consider several environmental factors including increased flooding sea-level rise and stronger heat waves and winter storms. In addition our agency has identified resources conservation strategies that are required to be considered with every new construction project to assure sustainability.”

Insurance

Experts warn that insurance providers face increased risk and exposure from more frequent catastrophic events. The Texas Department of Insurance which regulates the business of insurance has no policy on how climate change may impact the insurance industry.

On multiple occasions WFAA requested an interview with Governor Abbott asking why his government has no formal plans to address the risks Texans face from climate change. His office did not respond.

By contrast there is the example of Texas Forest Service responsible for protecting and sustaining the state’s trees and forests. It’s run by Texas A&M University and its leadership is not appointed by the Governor.

The U.S. Forest Service says that climate change may make trees more susceptible to disease and death. And while TFS says it does not have a formal policy on how climate change impacts its mission the agency’s Forest Action Plan gives strong consideration to the impact of climate change on forests and ways to address the issue.

The commissioners of the Texas General Land Office Texas Department of Agriculture and the Texas Railroad Commission are all elected positions and not appointed by the governor. None of these agencies have a policy on climate change either.

The Politics of Climate Change in Texas

“The politics of this if you're a Republican are very tricky” said Dr. Jim Henson Director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin.

Even though the science of climate change is rock solid Henson polled Texans asking ""is climate change happening?"" He found that the political divide on that question is enormous: 86% of strongly-identifying Democrats said yes compared to 25% of strongly-identifying Republicans.

“When everybody adopts a norm that says ‘You know we can't really talk about climate change directly or explicitly’ that's going to affect the policy discussion” he said. “Silence becomes the default option in a polarized environment like this.”

The politics of climate change also reached into government inquiries that followed the aftermath of the February winter storm.

During a hearing with experts to better understand why the state-run power grid failed in Texas Senator John Whitmire a Democrat from Houston said “I think we have to put it on the table ‘global warming’ or whatever is happening to our weather patterns. Would it be your educated advice that we better get ready for more?”

With that another senator who was chairing the hearing Kelly Hancock a Republican from Tarrant County interrupted.

“I really want to focus on last week. Was it predicted? Can you predict the extent? Should we have known it was going to last this long? How easy is that to predict? Those type of events” Hancock said. “Rather than get into a climate change discussion at this point” he added.

Conclusion

The science is clear: climate change is juicing up the destructiveness of hurricanes drought fire. Around the country and the world governments are making plans to address those risks.

Abbott thinks he can attract cargo to Texas ports due to delays in California. Here's why that makes no sense,"New York CNN Business —

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott thinks the delays at the nation’s largest ports in Southern California is an opportunity for Texas to capture more business.

Or at least he might want his state’s voters to think so even if he doesn’t believe it.

His campaign has put out a video which wrongly claims the way for cargo to get around delays in Southern California is to sail to ports in Texas instead.

“Are your products stuck off Long Beach? Texas ports are wide open” says the video which Abbott tweeted to his followers on Monday. “Port delays are up to 100 days in California. In less than two weeks your cargo can set sail from California and be at one of our 24/7 functioning Texas cargo ports unloaded and on their way to shelves near you. Choose a state that doesn’t see inflation and America’s supply chain backlog as a good thing. Escape California. Everyone’s doing it. Choose Texas.”

It’s true there has been a steady flow of both individuals and business from California to Texas in recent years. Most notably Tesla (TSLA) announced a month ago it is moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to near Austin. HP Enterprises a descendant of the company that helped give birth to Silicon Valley as the nation’s premier tech corridor and software and cloud services giant Oracle (ORCL) both announced they too are moving to the Texas state capital in December. There are good reasons including lower taxes and real estate prices those moves make sense for companies and individuals.

But when it comes to containers of cargo not so much.

There are many problems and inaccuracies with the governor’s video not the least of which is port delays are nowhere near 100 days in California. Earlier this fall they were averaging about 10 days. Now the delays to get into ports has dropped to seven to eight days according to data from Spire Global a data analytics firm that provides global vessel tracking data.

And no it doesn’t take “less than two weeks” of extra sailing time from Asia to Texas compared to the time it takes to sail from Asia to Los Angeles or neighboring Long Beach. Shanghai to Houston would be 37 days on average according to data from Spire. Shanghai to Los Angeles or Long Beach would be only 20 days.

Many of the largest container ships are actually too big to sail through the Panama Canal and couldn’t possibly make the trip that fast. In fact many of the ships that bring Asian cargo to Texas are going the other way around the world and making stops in Europe before reaching Houston.

Even with the port delays it’s faster to put a container unloaded in Los Angeles or Long Beach on a rail car and send it anywhere in the country including Texas than it is to sail all the way to a Gulf Coast or East Coast port. That’s why the West Coast ports handle the lion’s share of Asian imports.

“No other port in the Western Hemisphere has the infrastructure labor force rail network and warehousing to match the [container volume] that will move through the [Southern California ports] complex this year” said a statement from the Port of Los Angeles when asked about the Abbott’s video.

Abbott’s campaign and his administration did not respond to requests for comment from CNN Business about the video and its claims. The fact the video was made by his campaign and posted on Abbott’s personal Twitter feed and not the state’s economic development agency or the Port of Houston the only major container port in the state suggests it was aimed more at voters than at actually attracting business. Abbott is running for reelection in 2022.

To be sure Houston has seen an increase in container traffic this year and so have all US ports. The reason is the pandemic-related seismic shift in spending by US consumers away from services such as eating out travel or going out to movies or sporting events and more on actual goods which need to be moved. Even domestically made goods such as cars or appliances rely on parts that must be imported through the US ports.

So that’s why there are delays outside of Los Angeles and Long Beach which between them handle about 40% of containers carrying goods into the United States.

“The port complex will handle all-time record volumes amid the unprecedented surge in imports driven by the American consumer” said the statement from the Port of Los Angeles. “The supply chain challenges being faced around the world are largely a result of new levels of global demand.”

While Houston is seeing more cargo volume it has not seen any ships diverted from Southern California said Lisa Ashley spokesperson for the Port of Houston.

Houston is the nation’s 6th largest container port. But in 2020 it handled at equivalent of 2.9 million 20-foot containers of cargo which is how volumes are measured. That’s a fraction of the 9.2 million handled by Los Angeles alone plus another 8.1 million at Long Beach.

Houston’s primary business is bulk products primarily oil and gas. But it does handle 70% of the container traffic along the Gulf Coast and virtually all the containers at Texas ports. In the unlikely event a Los Angeles-bound container ship was diverted to Texas that’s where it would go.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1bm5lcnN3b3JsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzgxNzE3NDMvdXNhdGYtYWJib3R0LWRhc2gtNWstY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwcy1yZXN1bHRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 USATF 5K Championships Results | Abbott Dash to the Finish 5K,"To kick off the return of the New York City Marathon New York Road Runners hosted the Dash to the Finish Line 5K on Saturday morning which also served as the USATF 5K Championship.

Weini Kelati Wins Her First USATF Title Since Gaining U.S. Citizenship

Derek Call Weini Kelati crossing the finish line in Central Park.

Weini Kelati broke the tape first over a deep field that included Olympians and U.S. Champions. The Under Armour-sponsored athlete and two-time national champion at New Mexico continued her recent hot streak after winning the Boston 10K for Women on October 16 putting a whopping 40 seconds on the second-place finisher.

Much like that 10K the 24-year-old took the lead early and opened a gap on the field that never shrunk. She ran a new event record clocking 15:18 over a deceptively difficult course. The previous record was 15:24 set by Molly Huddle in 2017.

Kelati—who was born in Eritrea but grew up in Leesburg Virginia—officially became a United States citizen in June making this her first U.S. national championship. “It's a dream come true” she said about winning her first U.S. title.

Rounding out the podium were Grace Barnett of Mammoth Track Club and Erika Kemp of the Boston Athletic Association in 15:45 and 15:46 respectively.

Barnett—who is a part-time third fourth and fifth grade teacher—came in with the goal of placing top-10 but found herself in the top-5 toward the end of the race. She said after the race that all she thought about when churning toward the finish was kicking hard.

Kemp who won the USATF 20K championship earlier this year was pleasantly surprised to see Barnett rush past her in the final meters of the race. She and Lauren Paquette of Northern Arizona Elite were by themselves in second and third until 400 to go. Suddenly Kemp heard footsteps behind them. By 200 meters to go Barnett charged in front of her.

“You never want to get passed” Kemp said. “But then I saw it was Grace so I got really excited cause she’s great.”

After taking pictures with men’s winner Drew Hunter (see more below) Kelati was presented with another reward. After interviewing Hunter the MC moved on to Kelati. He asked about her favorite movie to which she replied McFarland USA.

Hunter Edges Past Centrowitz and Multiple U.S. Champions

Drew Hunter the 2019 U.S. Indoor 2-mile champion and member of Tinman Elite outlasted a tight pack of runners to cross the finish line first on Saturday morning in a time of 13:53.

Hunter hung around in the pack—which included Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz and two-time Olympic medalist Paul Chelimo—until 200 meters to go where he made his push to the finish.



The race was Hunter’s first since February of this year. He’s been dealing with injuries since the 2019 outdoor track season that saw him qualify for the World Championships.

“Any time you win a race you feel super super grateful” he said. “I’m happy to be healthy and happy to be out there again.”

Derek Call Drew Hunter crosses the line in first place in Central Park.

Centrowitz—who races for the Bowerman Track Club—said he was pleased with his performance over 5K a longer distance than he’s traditionally been successful.

“Between now and the indoor season the training wouldn’t be any different if I was getting ready for the [1500 meters] or the 5K” he said. “I’m just going to keep putting in good work and then do a little bit of under-distance racing and over-distance racing and see how things shape out.”

Sydney Gidabuday of Roots Running Project took the final podium spot. He made his move earlier but got swallowed up by the pack as everyone geared up for their final kicks. “It split up again when Drew made his move” he said. He was able to pick people up from that split and nearly nabbed Centrowitz at the line finishing with an identical time of 13:53.

Chelimo who celebrated his 31st birthday just last week had a disappointing day after charging off the startling line with an early lead finishing in 14:08. ""I’m not fit yet after the Olympics” he said after the race but noting he’s still happy to be in town with his family. “It’s just one of those type of races that’s always fun being in New York on marathon weekend.”

For their wins Kelati and Hunter took home $12000. A total of $60000 was distributed all the way through 10th place in both races.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1bm5lcnNwYWNlLmNvbS9lcHJvZmlsZS5waHA_ZXZlbnRfaWQ9MjUxOSZkbz1uZXdzJm5ld3NfaWQ9NjI4NTU30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USATF 5 km Championships - News - Weini Kelati and Drew Hunter Win 2021 USATF 5K Championships at Abbott ...,"Weini Kelati and Drew Hunter Win 2021 USATF 5K Championships at Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K

New York November 6 2021— Two-time NCCA champion Weini Kelati smashed the event record at the 2021 USATF 5K Championships at the Abbott Dash to the Finish Line on Saturday in Central Park taking the tape in 15:18 while U.S. indoor champion Drew Hunter won the men’s race in 13:53.

Kelati who became a U.S. citizen in June following a career at the University of New Mexico finished the race on a solo sprint to win her first U.S. title and better Molly Huddle’s previous event-best mark from 2017 by six seconds. She finished 29 seconds ahead of runner-up Grace Barnett a U.S. Olympic Trials finalist. Barnett crossed the line in 15:45 and was followed by two-time U.S. champion Erika Kemp in third place in 15:46. Rio 2016 Olympic gold medalist Gwen Jorgensen was sixth in 15:50.

It also marked the first U.S. road title for Hunter who jumped into the lead with about 100 meters to go in Central Park. Olympic gold medalist and seven-time national champion Matthew Centrowitz was second in 13:53 – seven tenths of a second back – and Sydney Gidabuday was third with the same time.

The Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K and USATF 5K Championships featured five Olympians and 28 athletes who competed at the 2020 U.S. Olympic Trials. It took place in Midtown Manhattan the day prior to the TCS New York City Marathon and featured a $60000 prize purse – the largest of any 5K race in the world.

Following in the footsteps of the professional athletes were around 7000 runners participating in the Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K including top local athletes and many runners participating in the marathon the following day.





Abbott the title sponsor of the Abbott World Marathon Majors served as the title sponsor of the Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K for the fifth time. Abbott a global healthcare company helps people live fully with life-changing technology and celebrates what’s possible with good health.

The Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K annually provides TCS New York City Marathon supporters friends and families the opportunity to join in on the thrill of marathon race week. The course begins on Manhattan’s east side by the United Nations then takes runners along 42nd Street past historic Grand Central Terminal and up the world-famous Avenue of the Americas past Radio City Music Hall. It then passes through the rolling hills of Central Park before finishing at the iconic TCS New York City Marathon finish line.

Improving cross-border payments with multi-CBDCs

Cross-border payments today can be slow and expensive. Unlike domestic payments where banks can pay each other directly on a single national payments platform there is no single international platform today for cross-border payments and settlements.

Instead the correspondent banking model is used where banks hold foreign currency accounts with each other. A single cross-border payment could pass through multiple correspondent banks using the foreign currencies held with them. Each leg of the overall transaction takes time and effort to process with fees levied that add up quickly and are passed on to customers resulting in slow and costly cross-border payments.

A multi-currency common settlement platform would enable transacting parties to pay each other in different currencies directly without the need for intermediaries such as correspondent banks.

A multi-CBDC shared platform will enable international settlements on a common platform streamlining the flow of cross-border payments and making payments faster cheaper and safer.

Designing and developing a multi-CBDC platform

Project Dunbar brings together the collective knowledge of central banks commercial banks and technology partners from earlier research and development work on digital currencies to design and develop a multi-CBDC platform. The primary work took place over nine weeks with three concurrent workstreams.

Challenges in implementing a multi-CBDC platform

A multi-CBDC platform for international settlements could significantly improve cross-border payments but there are challenges and questions regarding implementation that need to be addressed.

These critical challenges may have impeded the development of shared international settlement infrastructures previously but can now be resolved with modern technologies.

Addressing critical challenges

Distributed ledger technologies' decentralisation capabilities and the programmable nature of smart contracts and CBDCs tied together in a sophisticated platform design have produced an elegant solution for central banks to share a common settlement infrastructure for cross-border payments

Successful development of prototypes

Project Dunbar worked with R3 and Partior to successfully develop prototypes on the distributed ledger technologies of Corda and Quorum respectively. The prototypes proved the technical feasibility of implementing a shared multi-CBDC platform. While there are still further questions to be explored and challenges to be resolved the successful development is a first step towards the vision of a shared platform for international settlements using multi-CBDCs.

It consists of doing eight rounds of pushups for 25 reps with each subsequent variation increasing in difficulty.

""Doing 25 reps of any one of these pushup variations alone may not sound that difficult"" he says ""but what's going to make it challenging is compounding the repetitions in each exercise going back to back with only 20 seconds of rest.""

The first round is the easiest: incline pushups. This is followed by a round of normal pushups and then a set of diamond cutter pushups. ""Most people get to this level and gas out"" says Heria.

Things get more difficult from there with elevated decline pushups clapping pushups archer pushups and pseudo planche pushups performed with your hand placement in line with your waist. The eighth and final round the 90-degree pushup builds on this positioning tilting the body forward to lift the feet off the ground at the lower end of the rep.

Each variation must be completed with good technique and trying to crank out quick reps won't help in this challenge. ""If you rush them it doesn't count"" says Heria. ""Doing them slow and controlled is going to be a lot more difficult because you have a better quality of contraction increasing the time under tension of your muscles which is going to tear more muscle fibers and build way more strength and muscle than just doing your repetitions fast.""

It began in the 1970s when The Eight Samurai — Intel Robert Bosch Clarion Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Hewlett-Packard (HP) (now Keysight Technologies and Agilent Technologies) Litronix (now Osram Opto Semiconductors) Hitachi (now Renesas Electronics) and National Semiconductor — established their operations in Penang.

As the E&E sector continues to grow with the adoption of new innovative and advanced technology the multinational corporations (MNCs) have created opportunities for other mid- and downstream players as well as local companies that provide supporting activities.

That explains why Malaysian semiconductor-related players are particularly strong in the area of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) and automated test equipment (ATE) as their founders and CEOs were trained by the MNCs in Penang.

Over the years Penang or more specifically Bayan Lepas has evolved into a regional electronics manufacturing hub.

However the narrative may be changing as Batu Kawan has emerged in recent years as a strong E&E cluster. Not only is the Batu Kawan Industrial Park (BKIP) expected to replicate the success story of Bayan Lepas it may even outshine its 50-year-old counterpart.

Located off Seberang Perai on the mainland of Penang Batu Kawan is intended to be the state’s third satellite town after Bayan Baru and Seberang Jaya. But does it have what it takes to become the Silicon Valley of the East 2.0?

There is no better person to ask than Invest-in-Penang Bhd CEO Datuk Loo Lee Lian who has been promoting investments in the state since 2010.

When a company’s stock price doubles over the course of a year—and during a global pandemic no less—something must be going right. And when the company is the instrument maker Waters it’s tempting to tell a simple story: in September 2020 the firm lured Udit Batra from a senior post at Merck KGaA to be its CEO.

Waters at a glance ▸ Headquarters: Milford Massachusetts ▸ 2020 sales: $2.4 billion ▸ Employees: 7400 with 1112 in R&D roles ▸ Businesses: Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instruments. Markets are pharmaceuticals (59% of sales) other industries (30%) and academia and government (11%).

Over the ensuing 12 months Waters’s stock went from $212 to $417 per share the biggest increase in the instrumentation industry after years in which Waters lagged the field. The firm’s profit in the first 9 months of 2021 was 39% higher than in 2020 and sales were up 23%. Rock star CEO. Done next article.

A closer look reveals a more nuanced narrative. With a leading presence in quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) instruments and consumables for the drug industry Waters was in an excellent position to thrive during one of the largest medical research development and deployment efforts in human history. Many of the firm’s competitors—in its core business of liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) as well as to its TA Instruments brand of material characterization instruments—also had banner years.

Batra doesn’t claim to be a knight in shining armor but he’s also not shy about sharing the areas of improvement he’s identified at Waters and the progress he and his team have made in addressing them. Company veterans and outside observers say that Batra deserves credit for at least some of the gains in the past year and that he’s setting Waters up for continued success.

One change is a greater emphasis on external partnerships. Waters has long focused on organic growth building business through R&D and internally developed products while competitors such as Agilent Technologies and PerkinElmer supplement internal efforts by acquiring smaller analytical tool firms. Batra says organic growth is still the number 1 priority but the firm has evaluated 9000 possible acquisitions over the past year. He’s also open to partnerships that let Waters do something no one else is doing.

For example analytical tools to support biotech methods of drug development and manufacturing are a natural outgrowth of Waters’s strength in QA/QC Batra said at a recent investor event. But it isn’t an area that the company can enter alone.

To this end on Oct. 20 Waters unveiled an R&D partnership with the University of Delaware on analytical characterization of biologic drugs during manufacturing. Six days later Waters announced a deal to integrate its BioAccord LC/MS with the Ambr bioreactor system from the bioprocessing equipment maker Sartorius.

Waters has collaborated plenty in its 63-year history but Batra has brought a new perspective according to John Gebler the firm’s director of biopharma strategic growth. “Those bioprocessing companies will admit to us they’re not experts in analytics. And we’re not experts in bioprocessing; that’s not what we sell” Gebler says. “Udit has brought this opportunity for us to collaborate and partner in a very meaningful way.”

As exemplified in the Sartorius deal Batra and Gebler are working to place instruments in bioprocessing labs and plants instead of just having them at a customer’s centralized MS lab. That shifts instrument and interface design priorities because bioprocessing users are typically not mass spectrometrists Gebler says.

Researchers and technicians “at line” in a development or manufacturing lab aren’t inclined to tinker in the guts of an instrument. “They want to use the instrument as a tool for them to get their job done” Gebler says. “Under the hood you need to have extraordinary sophistication to make that happen.”

Another shift in strategy since Batra took over is that Waters will no longer shy away from cannabis a fast-growing market for analytical technologies. “I know that we are moving so we can play in that marketplace” Gebler says.

Batra is also overhauling the company’s performance management system and realigning its sales team to make better use of e-commerce and data Waters has on older instruments ready for replacement. “We lost track of that sort of customer” Batra says but now the team is a third of the way through a backlog of 8000 instruments that are past their normal 5-to-7-year replacement cycle.

“Waters has been a leader in the industry right? It had occupied the pole position for a long time and then we just fell off” Batra says. Shortcomings included internal business practices that needed reform a loss of focus on the company’s core expertise and missed opportunities in new customer categories such as contract research and manufacturing.

Batra says employees at all levels have been receptive to what he wants to do. “When we started to talk about how to kind of get back to the podium I said ‘Let’s throw a stone.’ They said ‘Let’s throw a brick.’ There was no resistance.”

Glenn Cudiamat CEO of the market research firm TDA Research says Batra’s subject-matter expertise has helped him get the company behind such changes. Batra has a PhD in chemical engineering and has worked in labs and management at Johnson & Johnson Novartis and Merck KGaA. He’s as comfortable talking with technical experts as he is with executives. Cudiamat says that credibility has helped Batra win the support of Waters’s staff.

That said since he started as CEO four of the eight members of Waters’s executive leadership team are new or in new roles. Cudiamat says scientific instrumentation firms are seeing a lot of turnover which can cut both ways. It’s a balance between retaining culture and institutional knowledge and making room for new talent. “I feel like he’s doing it exceptionally well” Cudiamat says of Batra.

With the demand boost due to the pandemic Batra has the benefit of leading Waters during a time of expansion for the products it sells. TDA predicts growth this year of 15% in the high-performance liquid chromatrography (HPLC) and LC/MS markets 13% in thermal analysis and rheometry and 22% in analytical technologies for bioprocessing. Batra says that as things return to normal 7% annual sales growth is a sustainable target for Waters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZWRnZW1hbGF5c2lhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NyZWF0aW5nLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5LWVhc3QtMjAtcGVuYW5ncy1tYWlubGFuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Creating the Silicon Valley of the East 2.0 on Penang's mainland,"KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): Penang is often dubbed the Silicon Valley of the East thanks to its strong and vibrant electrical and electronics (E&E) ecosystem.

It began in the 1970s when The Eight Samurai — Intel Robert Bosch Clarion Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Hewlett-Packard (HP) (now Keysight Technologies and Agilent Technologies) Litronix (now Osram Opto Semiconductors) Hitachi (now Renesas Electronics) and National Semiconductor — established their operations in Penang.

As the E&E sector continues to grow with the adoption of new innovative and advanced technology the multinational corporations (MNCs) have created opportunities for other mid- and downstream players as well as local companies that provide supporting activities.

That explains why Malaysian semiconductor-related players are particularly strong in the area of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) and automated test equipment (ATE) as their founders and CEOs were trained by the MNCs in Penang.

Over the years Penang or more specifically Bayan Lepas has evolved into a regional electronics manufacturing hub.

However the narrative may be changing as Batu Kawan has emerged in recent years as a strong E&E cluster. Not only is the Batu Kawan Industrial Park (BKIP) expected to replicate the success story of Bayan Lepas it may even outshine its 50-year-old counterpart.

Located off Seberang Perai on the mainland of Penang Batu Kawan is intended to be the state’s third satellite town after Bayan Baru and Seberang Jaya. But does it have what it takes to become the Silicon Valley of the East 2.0?

There is no better person to ask than Invest-in-Penang Bhd CEO Datuk Loo Lee Lian who has been promoting investments in the state since 2010.

The Edge also spoke to a few prominent business executives and captains of industry including Micron Technology Inc president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and Lam Research International Sdn Bhd general manager Soon K Kuek to get their views on investments in BKIP.

L'Oréal

French cosmetics company L'Oréal uses its advanced technologies and innovative ideas to give consumers more choice in customized cosmetics as well as contribute to sustainable development.

Women who feel it's difficult to pick a lipstick when hanging out now can make their own with YSL ROUGE SUR MESUR a smart ""lipstick printer.""

This portable bottle-like device which made its debut at the CIIE allows them to mix lip gloss of different colors and work out a color fitting them through technologies like augmented reality.

After putting tubes of lip gloss into the device users can connect it with their smartphone via a mobile application. Then they can choose a color from the color spectrum from the color of an item on the photo or from artificial intelligence analysis with the colors of their hair and clothes.

Then the device will release different amount of lip gloss from each tube and mix it to obtain the desired color.

Another device L'Oréal has brought to the CIIE for the first time is its water-saving hair care equipment.

L'Oréal Water Saver jointly developed by L'Oréal Group and the Swiss environmental innovation company Gjosa takes advantage of the fractional distillation principle design for rocket engines. It manages to lead precise collision between water flows which can form super tiny water droplets only one-tenth of the size of ordinary water droplets.

By this innovative process the washing efficiency is greatly improved and is able to save up to 80 percent water.

The system also provides users a one-stop hair care experience. It is able to mix up to three different products including shampoo conditioner and hair mask into tiny high-speed water droplets based on individual preferences. Meanwhile the powerful water flows will also give a massage-like comfort experience making the hair wash and care experience more personalized and enjoyable.

Shiseido

Shiseido has developed a technology which can create a daily ""second-layer skin"" – a kind of thin coating that can be applied to a person's face to relieve under-eye puffiness quickly.

By touching a large screen at the digital interaction area set by Shiseido visitors can see how under-eye puffiness disappears with the new technology.

Shiseido's Perfect UV Protector which is nicknamed ""Blue Fatty"" because of its cute ball-like blue bottle will soon have a new member to its family. The ""Pink Fatty"" debuted at the CIIE can nourish the skin as well as protecting it from the sun.

Anessa another brand under Shiseido popular among Chinese for its sunscreen product also showcases seven new products. An upgraded traditional product gives better protection to sun and heat.

For sustainable development Shiseido brings its skincare brand Baum which was set up last year. Based on the concept of ""co-existing with the nature"" it uses recycled wood to make the packing and more than 90 percent of its products are made of natural materials. Another two brands under it Elixir and Ipsa also use eco-friendly packing.

Kose

When using a mask people usually find the one-size type does not fit very well. But now they can customize their own mask size with a machine showcased by Kose by scanning their face.

After collecting the 3D data of one's face with a tablet the computer can have a printer run off the dry mask paper and then the customer can apply the toning lotion on it to make their own mask.

Kose also brought a nail printer it has cooperated with CASIO over to the expo. It can let customers print the pattern they like on their nails. This year they had a designer create a set of three patterns specially for CIIE. They also have another two sets which are respectively designed for autumn and are gender-neutral.

During the expo it will hold events to give a waste cosmetics ""rebirth."" Working with start-up MÅNGATA Kose developed technologies that can recycle waste cosmetics to produce pigment.

Its brand Sekkisei is also a supporter of sustainable development. Its Clear Wellness series uses environment-friendly material Bio-PET made of bagasse which emits less carbon dioxide in production.

Besides recycled packing it has no paper instructions inside and instead there is a QR code on the box for digital ones. The ink printed on the goods is biomass ink which is easily degradable and has less impact on the environment. It is also considering placing recycling boxes in some stores for used containers.

P&G

P&G brand SK-II provides a device called ""Mini Magic Scan"" which can test the quality of one's skin and help find problems through artificial intelligence analysis.

After showing one's face in the frame on the mirror and giving some basic information the device will give analysis about the skin in three minutes.

Meanwhile a new limited edition of SK-II essence features the brand's first fully recyclable bottle themed with American Pop artist Andy Warhol.

It also comes in a gift set with a unique Andy Warhol TV inspired pouch made from regenerated nylon an infinitely recyclable sustainable yarn made from ocean and landfill nylon waste like abandoned fishing nets.

At the sustainability exhibition area of P&G its brand Herbal Essences launched a new natural hair care product called ""Perennial"" which adheres to the concept of sustainable development and environmental protection.

The aluminum bottle and refill pack reduces plastic consumption per milliliter by approximately 62 percent compared to the same volume of plastic bottle.

The company works with the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in the United Kingdom and the Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to support the Kew Gardens Millennium Seed Bank program and to help scientists study and protect 20 endangered plants in China. These plants are printed on the bottles.

This area showcases nine products from six categories to demonstrate P&G's innovative approach to sustainability with respect to product development and design.

The rejoice non-rinse conditioner saves water for each rinse of conditioner equal to one person's two weeks of drinking water. The Tide liquid and pods' bottle and boxes and Safeguard liquid hand soap and body wash bottle are all recyclable.

The OLAY peach cream reduced plastic consumption by 4 percent annually equaling to a reduction of 3 million bottles of mineral water while Oral-B iO electric toothbrush's packaging is transitioning from paper-plastics to paper only.

Coty

It feels like entering a garden when visiting Coty. People can enjoy the smell of modern versions generated from the four classic fragrances created by French perfumer Francois Coty the brand's founder from a few decorations designed as bell-shaped flowers with long stems.

Coty a newcomer to the CIIE is the first company to use sustainable ethanol from captured carbon emissions in fragrance production which is a huge technological breakthrough across the beauty industry. Ethanol is a vital ingredient in the production of fragrances making up approximately 80 percent of the final product.

It achieved this in partnership with Lanzatech a leader in the production of new-generation green and sustainable ingredients.

The latter's sun care product Lancaster Sun Sensitive offers clean and vegan formulas developed to be compliant with the strictest clean charter of application with 40 percent fewer ingredients. It's ocean friendly and the packaging is also eco-conscious containing a minimum of 50 percent post-consumer recycled materials.

Industrial emissions which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases are being transformed into fragrances by brands like Gucci Burberry and others.

The Chloe Naturelle is a fully natural origin fragrance which is developed with sustainably harvested ingredients including neroli rose cedar and citron and lower-impact packaging.

Unilever

People may think that cosmetics are only for facial use. But at the area of Unilever visitors can find ""make-up"" and ""mask"" for their teeth.

Among the four imported brands Unilever introduces to CIlE for the first time there is Signal a leading French oral whitening brand. Its whitening pen which is easy for carrying can help people make their teeth look white for urgent use such as dating and interviews.

Its 3D customized teeth whitening kit which applies special gel on the teeth like a ""mask"" will make one's teeth whiten as soon as six days in a safe way.

Another brand REGENERATE is the world's first toothpaste maker that repairs tooth enamel.

Unilever also has a ""Sustainable Action Wall"" showing how laundry detergent brand OMO ""air"" laundry capsules are made.

This product is the first laundry product on the market in the world that uses carbon capture technology to make carbon from the air. This breaks through the washing industry's tradition of extracting carbon from fossil fuels to make detergent surfactants. This ""green technology"" originated from Unilever's research and development team in China and was first listed in the Chinese market.

This is the first time that OMO's ""air"" laundry capsule has been showcased at CIIE providing Chinese consumers with another new option for ""green consumption"".

Estée Lauder

If you want to know details about your skin problems but are reluctant to see a doctor you can come to the area of Estée Lauder.

A machine which has three types of light sources to catch the surface middle and deep layers of one's skin clearly with a camera can detect wrinkles spots and clogged pores and give an evaluation and analysis.

After the camera takes three photos of one's face from left middle and right the machine can give a quick analysis. How serious the problem is will be marked with three colors – green yellow and red – from lowest to highest level.

Each part of the skin can be magnified on the screen with lines and circles to show where the problem is.

Decorating the booth with a model of a wooded valley with a train running around Jo Malone British fragrance and lifestyle brand under Estée Lauder introduce their latest three products based on natural ingredients including rose magnolia mandarin honey white moss and snowdrop all in well-designed bottles. The White Moss & Snowdrop is expected to retail in stores next month.

But several owners of Moxy hotels have turned on Marriott and choose to sell their best rooms through Airbnb.com skipping Marriott’s distribution channels entirely.

I wrote about the Moxy Portland Downtown selling its suite only through Airbnb. Since then that listing has been taken down. Once revealed Marriott couldn’t have taken kindly to the practice. But this isn’t the only hotel doing it.

If you create a product for Airbnb guests then that’s the platform where you’ll find your customers right? Rather than Marriott.com?

Personally I don’t like hotel rooms without desks but it’s not just Moxy owners turning to Airbnb for distribution.

And lest you think it’s only Marriott’s lower-end brands unloading room inventory on Airbnb sometimes to the exclusion of selling the same rooms through Marriott channels would you be surprised to learn that the St. Regis New York is bookable at Airbnb and that they undercut Marriott.com pricing there ?

The St. Regis is available for booking the night of April 5 2022 – the first date I picked at random:

According to the Airbnb listing “The $587.00) room is similar to a Deluxe room at St Regis NYC (~430 sq/ft).” Marriott prices the deluxe room type at about $100 more than a base room. Here’s their prepaid listing for the same night:

Marriott has their own homesharing platform to compete directly with Airbnb but Marriott hotels list at Airbnb and not Marriott Homes & Villas and in some cases pull their room inventory from Marriott entirely to sell suites through Airbnb. Do these room bookings even go into their property’s system with revenue reported out to Marriott for calculating fees?

What I find perhaps most striking is nobody at Marriott corporate thought to Google “airbnb+[Marriott brand]” to suss this stuff out? What are they paying these people for?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbWljaGlnYW5hZHZhbmNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzA2L21pY2hpZ2FuLWNvdWxkLW9wZW4tdGhlLWZsb29kZ2F0ZXMtb24tc2hvcnQtdGVybS1yZW50YWxzLW92ZXJydWxpbmctbG9jYWwtZ292ZXJubWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan could open the floodgates on short-term rentals overruling local governments • Michigan Advance,"Imagine buying your first home in a coastal community — or even your dream home on a lake — and creating a peaceful backyard oasis. But when warm weather rolls around you soon discover a revolving door at the house next door. Loud music late-night bonfires even PA systems beer pong and extra tents take over the yard.

These are some of the issues created by short-term vacation rentals according to local government and municipal officials who oppose recent state legislation that would preempt local regulations on short-term rentals.

“The general feeling in our community — and not just in resort towns but all communities — is that we’re not supportive of efforts to do land-use planning from Lansing” said Grand Haven City Manager Pat McGinnis.

In a late-night vote last week the Michigan House of Representatives approved a bill that essentially nullifies local ordinances on short-term rentals — which have become increasingly popular with the growth of companies like Airbnb and VRBO — in the name of protecting private property rights.

The legislation prohibits local municipalities from adopting zoning regulations that outright ban short-term rentals or make them subject to a special-use or conditional-use permit. The San Francisco-based company Airbnb has a long history of fighting local regulations across the country.

Proponents say House Bill 4722 sponsored by Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport Twp.) protects an owner’s right to rent.

But opponents say short-term rentals should be regulated at the local level. Noise trash and nuisance complaints and a lack of affordable housing for year-round residents are some of the issues associated with too many short-term rentals in a community. Other studies show short-term rentals deplete housing stock and increase rent for long-term renters.

Under the bill local governments can continue to create and enforce ordinances related to inspections noise traffic and other nuisances that apply to rentals and owner-occupied residences. However local officials say that does little to address the erosion of neighborhoods quality of life issues home values and other problems associated with short-term occupants.

Lightner first introduced the bipartisan legislation back in April. House Bill 4722 was not on the Oct. 26 agenda but an amended version passed 55-48 after the GOP-controlled House stayed in session past 2 a.m. Oct. 27.

“I was very surprised it moved on [Oct. 27] in the way and fashion it did” said Jennifer Rigterink a legislative associate with the Michigan Municipal League (MML) which opposes the bill. “Nobody knew they were voting on it.”

Amid the wrangling three of the bill’s co-sponsors — Reps. Sara Cambensy (D-Marquette) Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills) and Brad Paquette (R-Niles) — withdrew their names from the bill in a somewhat unusual move. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Regulatory Reform.

Back in the spring Steckloff agreed to add her name to the bill after being told it was about personal property rights — not short-term rentals. She called it a “freshman mistake” and fielded complaints from constituents and local officials in her district for months. Steckloff had to wait to withdraw her name from the bill until the House took it up. She voted no last week.

“You cannot approach this as a one-size-fits-all” she told the Advance Thursday. “This is a local issue.”

Lightner’s office declined a request for an interview but sent the Advance her statement.

“The measure approved by the House is a solid compromise that provides both certainty for private property owners across the state and flexibility for local municipalities that deserve to have some control over the planning and zoning of their communities” Lightner said.

Both the Michigan Realtors an advocacy group for Michigan’s real estate professionals and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy a free-market think tank support the legislation.

“The key thing here is from our perspective we’re very strong on private property rights and people should be able to do what they want with their own property” said Mackinac Center Director of Marketing and Communications Jarrett Skorup who testified in favor of the bills in May.

“The reason it is a big deal now is the internet and Airbnb” he added. “It’s skyrocketed in popularity.”

Calls to Michigan Realtors were not returned for this story but the association does have a statement on its website maintaining that local governments can enforce nuisance ordinances and housing codes to protect public safety and address any unruly behavior.

“There is a growing trend in local government to enact zoning bans that preemptively tell property owners they are unable to rent” the group says. “The rental of residential property is important to Michigan second home markets and in urban areas around event destinations. Banning the right to rent harms property owners and local businesses in many communities all over Michigan.”

Local control

Many local officials say communities should have the final say over regulations for short-term rentals. They say the proposed law also sets a precedent for issues that impact local communities giving Lansing the authority to dictate local laws.

“It’s a big challenge for us” said Traverse City Mayor Jim Carruthers. “We’re the ones that live here and try to make it a livable place for everybody and set the rules and priorities.”

The MML a nonprofit association representing municipalities and their leaders calls HB 4722 “disastrous” and said it essentially gives unfettered approval to short-term vacation rentals across the state.

“When it comes to the property rights issue there seems to be a lack of acknowledgement that everybody has property rights” Rigterink told the Advance. “Why are they getting more out of this than the person who lives next door? That seems to be lost.”

Rigterink has been fielding plenty of calls from members after the surprise vote. One issue hinges on whether short-term rentals are considered commercial use. HB 4722 specifically states short-term rentals are not a commercial use of property. Rather it is a residential use of property and should be permitted in all residential zones.

Rigterink disagrees and said that is the whole point of zoning for conflicting uses. “If you want to open a mechanic shop in your garage you can’t do that” she said.

Permanent residents also have the right to enjoy their property negate nuisances and protect property values. For instance many vacationers stay up later — and may have bonfires parties or play loud music — while the person next door is trying to sleep and get up for work the next day.

“We are not opposed to short-term rentals” Rigterink said. “They have said that communities are banning short-term rentals. We don’t agree with that but they should have the ability to regulate them to balance the need of full-time residents as well as accommodate visitors. …Like any land use too much of one thing becomes a negative impact on other things.”

While those opposed to the bill say communities aren’t banning outright short-term rentals Skorup argues that municipalities like Holland Township and St. Clair Shores essentially have full bans through their zoning. And several destination cities including Detroit and Traverse City prohibit short-term rentals in residentially zoned areas.

The heated debate continues in New Buffalo a Southwest Michigan community that recently extended a moratorium on new short-term rental licenses until Dec. 13.

“They haven’t fully banned them but you’re banning it for the vast majority of property owners” Skorup said.

Lakeshore communities

Short-term rentals are more prevalent in lakeshore communities that attract tourists and those that host sporting events but they also are located on small inland lakes and in rural parts of the Upper Peninsula.

Typically tourists vacationers and some business travelers rent them for a brief stay or not more than 30 days through platforms like Airbnb VRBO Vacasa Turnkey and others.

Many lakeshore communities have already adopted short-term rental ordinances that officials say are in the best interest of local residents and homeowners. Some municipalities including Traverse City and Grand Haven have taken the stance that short-term rentals are a commercial activity and local zoning rules prohibit other commercial activities in residential neighborhoods. Several communities in Ottawa County have regulations on short-term rentals or continue to examine the issue while also opposing the bill.

Grand Haven welcomes short-term rentals but there needs to be a balanced approach McGinnis said. In 2017 the city developed a short-term rental ordinance in response to complaints from residents who showed up at public meetings. The city allows short-term rentals in specific zoning districts and requires out-of-town owners to designate a local agent to manage the rental and address problems.

The proposed law states communities cannot restrict short-term rentals to less than 30% of the number of existing residential units in the local unit of government. In Grand Haven that means up to 1500 homes could convert to short-term rentals.

“Right now we just have under 300 short-term rentals” McGinnis said. “Multiply that by five and they’re much more likely to occur near water and those neighborhoods could become completely overrun with short-term rentals and that’s just not good for our town.”

In today’s digital economy it’s relatively easy for an outside investor or homeowner to advertise their property as a short-term rental. In Traverse City Grand Haven and other lakeshore communities the demand is there and so is the lure of making money. But having too many short-term rentals on one residential street causes unintended problems.

“It’s the change in use that is the problem for that neighborhood” McGinnis said. “Effective land-use planning results in fewer conflicts.”

There’s also some opposition from business groups like the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association which says the legislation would add to the challenges the hotel and lodging industry faces while continuing to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides taking business away from traditional hotels short-term rentals aren’t subject to the same taxes or regulations.

President and CEO Justin Winslow said 70% of voters oppose legislation that strips power from local governments to control short-term rentals and 79% believe they should be taxed the same as hotels.

“Bill 4722 is not a thoughtful solution to a complicated issue that needs to balance residential safety fair competition and property rights — it is a tone-deaf handout to mostly out-of-state corporations that will erode neighborhoods increase crime and cost jobs” Winslow said in a statement.

Lack of affordable housing

While Traverse City has a short-term rental ordinance permitting them in commercially zoned areas Carruthers said “a lot of people have been doing it on the down low.”

Area residents are turning garage apartments and even backyard tents into short-term rentals and investment companies also are buying up homes for vacation rentals.

“Taking away local control ties our hands on this and it could be many other things” Carruthers said. “If we let it go hog wild we won’t have neighborhoods.”

One of the biggest challenges facing Traverse City is having enough quality housing for a range of incomes and demographics including families retirees single individuals young professionals and a growing homeless population.

Skyrocketing housing costs have pushed hospitality and service industry workers into outlying areas or forced them to relocate. The city has offered incentives to developers to build more affordable units but even those are becoming short-term rentals in commercially zoned areas.

“Our restaurant workers are having a hard time living here [and] we’re a foodie town” Carruthers said. “It does erode the long-term opportunities for people to live here.”

McGinnis said Grand Haven deals with more problems and noise complaints during the busy summer months and it would take more staff to enforce noise and nuisance ordinances associated with more short-term rentals.

In addition the city’s infrastructure — water sewer and other utilities — were built for a year-round population. A 30% reduction in use during the winter months has other implications.

“We are doing it well; we are doing it the way it was meant to be done” McGinnis said. “This is simply special-interest lobbyists who are influencing our state legislature to benefit themselves to the detriment of all of the communities of Michigan.”

Short-term rentals take away year-round housing stock and affordable housing is already an issue for local residents and service-industry workers who live in tourist towns.

“People who work here need to have a place to live” McGinnis said. “This is not a false concern. It really could happen and you would have all of these communities where the population could dip 20 or 30%.”

Legislative litigation loopholes

Short-term rentals have been on the Michigan Legislature’s radar for several years but bills haven’t gained traction until last month.

Lawmakers contend HB 4722 strikes a balance between property owners who may want to buy an investment property or a second home and then rent it out while still giving local municipalities some authority in how to regulate the industry.

Steckloff said she appreciates short-term rentals and she does use them as do many businesspeople who visit the Farmington Hills area for work. But she said there are problems with the bill particularly the stipulation that permits short-term rentals in up to 30% of existing residential units.

“You cannot legislate for the entire state of Michigan” she said. “In my district 30% is almost 15000 of our housing stock.”

McGinnis has attended previous legislative hearings in Lansing to address attempts to change the law. He was surprised about the late-night vote on the bill.

“That’s the worst kind of public policymaking” he said. “I would hope the Senate is more levelheaded. Let’s talk about it — how can we make it so people can reasonably use their properties without destroying communities?”

Rigterink sees the law as ripe for litigation. Who determines the 30% of property owners eligible to have a short-term rental while denying the other 70% — is it based on location a first-come first-serve application process housing density or other factors?

In addition the law allows local governments to limit the number of units under common ownership used for short-term rentals to two. Proponents say that will prevent outside investors and corporations from owning too many units but opponents disagree.

Up until now the closest we could get to Bradshaw’s apartment was the front stoop of the 64 Perry Street (in later seasons 66 Perry Street) building that served as the exterior of Bradshaw’s building (the 245 E. 73rd Street address on the Upper East Side does not have any such building at that location). Now though Airbnb is partnering up with Sarah Jessica Parker herself to rent out Carrie Bradshaw’s now-legendary brownstone apartment; for a reasonable $23.00 a night.

The recreation of Bradshaw’s apartment showcases set pieces that eagle-eyed fans will immediately recognize. Everything from the palm leaf-printed bench at the end of the bed Carrie’s couture-filled closet and her iconic landline phone are showcased. Upon arrival guests receive a virtual welcome narrated by Sarah Jessica Parker (in a nod to the way Parker provided a voiceover at the beginning of every episode). The stay also includes both brunch in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood as well as a photoshoot in Carrie Bradshaw’s wardrobe which will most likely include fashion staples like her ever-present Manolo Blahnik’s. In addition to providing a one of a kind New York City moment for loyal fans Airbnb is also making a one-time pledge to The Studio Museum a contemporary art museum in Harlem that showcases works by artists of African descent.

“The Carrie Bradshaw character is near and dear to my heart and revisiting her world for the continuation of the “Sex and the City” story has been such a joy” Parker said in a press release. “I’m excited for our audience to experience Carrie’s New York like never before and walk in her shoes quite literally for the first time.”

Facebook



Google rebranded in 2015 to invest in ambitious projects like Loon Nest and Waymo.

But many of its projects have shuttered sunk cash or been reabsorbed into Google.

Facebook now Meta will need to make sure it doesn't face the same fate.

Meta formerly known as Facebook is betting big on the metaverse.

That's why it changed its name: to reflect its goal of expanding into what will succeed the modern-day internet. Zuckerberg has said it never made sense anyway for the company which houses multiple projects and apps to go by one of their names (Facebook.)

And if that move sounds familiar it's because that's how Google restructured itself in 2015 to allow each of its businesses to operate more efficiently.

When Alphabet stood up Google and its ""Other Bets"" endeavors – devoted to futuristic tech – were split into two buckets and housed under that umbrella. The latter included the Waymo self-driving car initiative and Loon slated to transform broadband access with solar-powered hot air balloons.

But in the six years since Google has moved at a glacial pace to drive some of its ""moonshot projects"" into mainstream use as CNBC recently noted. While some have shown promise others have been reabsorbed into Google sunk loads of cash spun off as separate entities or been shuttered altogether.

And as Meta gears up to pour billions into its metaverse mission over the years ""we're seeing history repeat itself"" Whitney Tilson a former hedge-fund manager and the CEO of Empire Financial Research told Insider.

Cashflow can hinder ambitious projects from true growth

One of Alphabet's Loon balloons floats through the skies of New Zealand.

Tilson says a major weak point for Google was creating an overarching framework in Alphabet. Instead the company should have spun out its ambitious projects instead of keeping them under a parent company where they were insulated from the market with Alphabet's pile of cash.

""Because it had access to unlimited capital with very little oversight it has not achieved what it could have achieved as an independent company with its own board of directors where it had to go back to the market for capital by showing milestones"" Tilson said.

For example Alphabet's electric kite-project Makani was supposed to harness a more sustainable source of wind energy. But the company shut it down in early 2020 since ""the road to commercial viability is a much longer and riskier road"" than expected.

Loon was shut down earlier this year and Waymo – Google's spin-off sibling company – recently saw its CEO CFO and other top brass exit as insiders grew frustrated with the autonomous tech firm's slow progress toward mass adoption Bloomberg reported.

Other projects have been transferred from Alphabet's Other Bets bucket back to the Google division where its search engine is housed. That happened to Jigsaw – a technology incubator devoted to solving disinformation and other online issues – in early 2020 Nest the smart home project in 2018 and Chronicle an endeavor devoted to cybersecurity in 2019.

And the company has sunk a sizable amount into these ""moonshot projects."" Other Bets have gobbled up $3.2 billion in capital and a reported $24.3 billion in operating losses since Google renamed itself as Bloomberg reported in May. Deepmind the Alphabet-owned artificial intelligence company alone reported $649 million in losses in 2019 with the majority of costs going toward staff and other factors as CNBC reported.







Investors have shrugged off any losses. Google's market value has soared since the reorganization outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index by double since 2015.

As will Facebook's regardless of how its metaverse project churns out Tilson said because the two firms' core businesses and their positions in the digital ads space are just that strong.

Zuckerberg and other company executives have acknowledged that it will be years before the metaverse materializes – at least 10 years to be exact.

But Tilson said Facebook should do what Google should have done: focus on its supremely successful businesses deal with the high-profile problems associated with them and ""not waste $10 billion a year on the metaverse.""

""Google and Facebook are both examples of the world's greatest businesses but also how the world's greatest businesses lead to so much cashflow that it leads to complacency and capital allocation mistakes and empire building"" Tilson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwaWNld29ya3MuY29tL3RlY2gvY2xvdWQvbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtc21lLWdyb3VwLWNsb3VkLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwL9IBTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwaWNld29ya3MuY29tL3RlY2gvY2xvdWQvbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtc21lLWdyb3VwLWNsb3VkLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Locks On to the Finserv Industry With 10-Year CME Partnership,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2xldHRlcnMvMjAyMS0xMS0wNy9hcHBsZS1hYXBsLW1heS1ldmVudHVhbGx5LWxpbWl0LW5ldGZsaXgtbmZseC1nYW1pbmctcHVzaC1vbi1pcGhvbmUtaXBhZC1rdnBsb3F0atIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple (AAPL) May Eventually Limit Netflix (NFLX) Gaming Push on iPhone iPad,"Netflix’s games offering is currently limited on Android—and will likely remain forever so on iOS.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

The Yellowstone prequel show 1883 may not debut until next month but we've already gotten our first look at some of the show's main characters courtesy of the Yellowstone season 4 premiere.

As Yellowstone grappled with the fallout from its dramatic season 3 cliffhangers in the first part of its big 2-part debut it offered up a brief glimpse into the world that awaits fans in 1883—albeit slightly down the road from where the story will begin. Early on in the first episode we see a flashback scene set in March 1893—10 years after 1883 is set to begin. The flashback takes place on the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch confirming that at least within a year of the Duttons setting out for Montana they'll have established their homestead.

The scene also features the screen debut of Tim McGraw as James Dillard Dutton the family patriarch and grandfather to Yellowstone's John Dutton. In the scene James and two of his young sons—Charlie Stover as Spencer Dutton and Jack Michael Doke as the future John Dutton Senior—encounter a group of Indigenous People on the ranch who ask Dutton's permission of bury one of their elders on the property. Though the conversation is cordial and James provides the group with a steer to ensure they're fed fans of Yellowstone know that the tensions between the Dutton family and the Native American tribes on Montana is far from over.

1883 will premiere on Paramount+ on Sunday December 19.

When Alphabet stood up Google and its ""Other Bets"" endeavors – devoted to futuristic tech – were split into two buckets and housed under that umbrella. The latter included the Waymo self-driving car initiative and Loon slated to transform broadband access with solar-powered hot air balloons.

But in the six years since Google has moved at a glacial pace to drive some of its ""moonshot projects"" into mainstream use as CNBC recently noted. While some have shown promise others have been reabsorbed into Google sunk loads of cash spun off as separate entities or been shuttered altogether.

And as Meta gears up to pour billions into its metaverse mission over the years ""we're seeing history repeat itself"" Whitney Tilson a former hedge-fund manager and the CEO of Empire Financial Research told Insider.

Cashflow can hinder ambitious projects from true growth

Tilson says a major weak point for Google was creating an overarching framework in Alphabet. Instead the company should have spun out its ambitious projects instead of keeping them under a parent company where they were insulated from the market with Alphabet's pile of cash.

""Because it had access to unlimited capital with very little oversight it has not achieved what it could have achieved as an independent company with its own board of directors where it had to go back to the market for capital by showing milestones"" Tilson said.

For example Alphabet's electric kite-project Makani was supposed to harness a more sustainable source of wind energy. But the company shut it down in early 2020 since ""the road to commercial viability is a much longer and riskier road"" than expected.

Loon was shut down earlier this year and Waymo – Google's spin-off sibling company – recently saw its CEO CFO and other top brass exit as insiders grew frustrated with the autonomous tech firm's slow progress toward mass adoption Bloomberg reported.

Other projects have been transferred from Alphabet's Other Bets bucket back to the Google division where its search engine is housed. That happened to Jigsaw – a technology incubator devoted to solving disinformation and other online issues – in early 2020 Nest the smart home project in 2018 and Chronicle an endeavor devoted to cybersecurity in 2019.

And the company has sunk a sizable amount into these ""moonshot projects."" Other Bets have gobbled up $3.2 billion in capital and a reported $24.3 billion in operating losses since Google renamed itself as Bloomberg reported in May. Deepmind the Alphabet-owned artificial intelligence company alone reported $649 million in losses in 2019 with the majority of costs going toward staff and other factors as CNBC reported.







Investors have shrugged off any losses. Google's market value has soared since the reorganization outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index by double since 2015.

As will Facebook's regardless of how its metaverse project churns out Tilson said because the two firms' core businesses and their positions in the digital ads space are just that strong.

Zuckerberg and other company executives have acknowledged that it will be years before the metaverse materializes – at least 10 years to be exact.

But Tilson said Facebook should do what Google should have done: focus on its supremely successful businesses deal with the high-profile problems associated with them and ""not waste $10 billion a year on the metaverse.""

""Google and Facebook are both examples of the world's greatest businesses but also how the world's greatest businesses lead to so much cashflow that it leads to complacency and capital allocation mistakes and empire building"" Tilson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwaWNld29ya3MuY29tL3RlY2gvY2xvdWQvbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtc21lLWdyb3VwLWNsb3VkLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwL9IBTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwaWNld29ya3MuY29tL3RlY2gvY2xvdWQvbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtc21lLWdyb3VwLWNsb3VkLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Locks On to the Finserv Industry With 10-Year CME Partnership,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2xldHRlcnMvMjAyMS0xMS0wNy9hcHBsZS1hYXBsLW1heS1ldmVudHVhbGx5LWxpbWl0LW5ldGZsaXgtbmZseC1nYW1pbmctcHVzaC1vbi1pcGhvbmUtaXBhZC1rdnBsb3F0atIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple (AAPL) May Eventually Limit Netflix (NFLX) Gaming Push on iPhone iPad,"Netflix’s games offering is currently limited on Android—and will likely remain forever so on iOS.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

The Yellowstone prequel show 1883 may not debut until next month but we've already gotten our first look at some of the show's main characters courtesy of the Yellowstone season 4 premiere.

As Yellowstone grappled with the fallout from its dramatic season 3 cliffhangers in the first part of its big 2-part debut it offered up a brief glimpse into the world that awaits fans in 1883—albeit slightly down the road from where the story will begin. Early on in the first episode we see a flashback scene set in March 1893—10 years after 1883 is set to begin. The flashback takes place on the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch confirming that at least within a year of the Duttons setting out for Montana they'll have established their homestead.

The scene also features the screen debut of Tim McGraw as James Dillard Dutton the family patriarch and grandfather to Yellowstone's John Dutton. In the scene James and two of his young sons—Charlie Stover as Spencer Dutton and Jack Michael Doke as the future John Dutton Senior—encounter a group of Indigenous People on the ranch who ask Dutton's permission of bury one of their elders on the property. Though the conversation is cordial and James provides the group with a steer to ensure they're fed fans of Yellowstone know that the tensions between the Dutton family and the Native American tribes on Montana is far from over.

1883 will premiere on Paramount+ on Sunday December 19.

Friends

Although things appear to be heating up again for American cannabis stocks as of Friday’s close large Canadian LPs didn’t benefit from the exclusive news reported by Marijuana Moment about a Republican-led bill to legalize cannabis.

It’s been a very tough year for the Canadian LPs and the earnings report from Canopy Growth on Friday certainly reinforced the notion that the Canadian market remains challenging for its largest players. While the overall market has advanced 57% year-to-date through September most of the publicly traded LPs have struggled with market share losses. Excluding acquisitions the largest LPs have seen their adult-use cannabis sales decline recently compared to a year ago. Through Friday the New Cannabis Ventures Canadian Cannabis LP Index has declined 14% so far in 2021. It closed just 20% above the multi-year low set in March 2020 and is down from five years ago:

With sentiment perhaps as low as it can be we think a big M&A deal could be in the works with Altria potentially buying the remaining shares outstanding of Cronos Group. This is an idea we have been discussing with subscribers at our 420 Investor premium service for several months now and we think it makes a great deal of sense. Predicting the timing of such a transaction though is always a challenge. Before we explain why we think this could happen next week we will discuss the history and detail our rationale for the deal.

History

It was almost three years ago that Altria announced its strategic investment into Cronos Group: Altria Buys 45% of Cronos Group for C$2.4 billion with Option to Take Controlling Stake

The deal which closed in March of 2019 infused the company with approximately US$1.8 billion with Altria paying C$16.25 (about US$12) a price that was characterized as a 41.5% premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average price as of November 30 2018. Altria also acquired warrants at C$19 that would give it majority ownership if exercised. Additionally it took control of the Board of Directors. Altria made Cronos Group its exclusive partner for pursuing cannabis opportunities globally.

Since the deal has closed the companies have seemingly worked very well together though both have seen their shares decline since the announcement:

The warrants that Altria holds are now out of the money as Cronos Group is trading at 65% below the C$19 exercise price and they expire in just 16 months.

Why the Deal Makes Sense

We believe that Cronos Group is a good strategic fit for Altria which continues to look beyond tobacco for growth. With a quarter remaining in 2021 Altria is expected to generate revenue of $21.6 billion up just 4% from a year ago. Analysts currently forecast little or no top-line growth for the next several years. Over the past 5 years it has seen revenue increase just 12% though earnings growth has been a bit higher (9% compound annualized growth over 5 years).

Cronos Group has followed a different path than most of its peers pursuing an “asset-light” strategy. As of Q2 its entire investment in fixed assets was $193 million and its inventory was less than $36 million. The company didn’t overbuild for the Canadian market. Its cash balance was $1.1 billion at mid-year with no debt whatsoever. Cronos Group has pursued an investment into cannabinoids produced by yeast fermentation and has been focused on markets outside of Canada particularly Israel and the U.S. where it has CBD operations as well as a recent investment in an option to acquire a minority stake in MSO PharmaCann. It has also pursued investment into consumption device research.

Altria has a market cap of $83 billion. Adding in net debt the enterprise value is $108 billion. Cronos Group is quite small relative to Altria with a market cap of $2 billion (less than 3% of Altria) and an enterprise value of $900 million roughly (less than 1% of Altria). Our point is that even paying a 75% premium for the equity of Cronos Group ($9.25) would cost the company $2.5 billion net of cash or less than 3% of its enterprise value. This is less than a single quarter of operating income for the company. The financial impact on its own P&L and balance sheet would be minimal. Since the company owns 156.6 million shares (42%) already the actual cost to acquire the remainder of the company would be substantially lower. In fact the $2 billion required to buy the remaining shares of Cronos at $9.25 would be $2 billion which is less than the cash balance at Altria as of 9/30. Of course a deal could be at a different price and could be stock-based rather than in cash. Our point is that this is rather insignificant financially to Altria.

Because Altria owns less than half of Cronos Group it doesn’t consolidate the results in its financials. Instead the financials reflect only the changes in the carrying value of the investment. The fact that Altria’s investment has deteriorated is already reflected in its financials.

With the stock price low especially in light of a still tremendous cash balance relative to the market cap buying Cronos is less about near-term financial benefits for Altria than doubling down on its strategic vision. The companies have worked closely now for almost three years and we believe that Cronos Group is likely much more limited than the combined company would be in pursuing more deals like the PharmaCann transaction. Altria’s larger size will allow a more aggressive investment into the American cannabis industry over the next few years. The original plan to acquire control of the company by exercising warrants is now at risk with the warrants way underwater and running out of time. Altria would be prudent in our view to rethink its position and buy the balance of Cronos Group now.

A Potential Clue on the Timing

Cronos Group is a large accelerated filer with the SEC which means its Q3 financials are due on Tuesday November 9th. Historically the company has provided investors with at least a week’s advance notice of its conference call but there has been no call announced yet.



We believe it’s possible that that the lack of notification is because a deal is brewing. To be clear this is just our speculation but we can’t come up with any other reason for not announcing a conference call thus far except that it might have a pending acquisition of its own.

What If We Are Wrong

We know we are going out on a limb here with a very speculative call and recognize that we could be wrong about the reason for no conference call announcement. With that said we don’t see substantial downside in the stock if our hunch proves to be incorrect. The good news is that our view doesn’t appear to be priced in at all with Cronos Group printing a 52-week low on Friday.

While we may be missing some nefarious reason for the lack of announcement we believe that investors are likely to receive a relatively good report from the company. To date the cannabis sales have been modest but data from Hifyre showed very strong sales during Q3 at the retail stores with sequential growth of 48% far outpacing the market growth of 9% during the quarter. This is in stark contrast to drastic loss of share at its larger peers like Aurora Canopy Growth and Tilray. According to Sentieo analysts are expecting revenue to reach a record $19 million in Q3 representing 67% growth from a year ago.

Cronos Group’s valuation is quite low in our view relative to other large Canadian LPs. The stock trades at just 1.4X tangible book value. Unlike its peers it isn’t burdened with a high level of inventory or excess production capacity. In fact its cash balance is more than half of its tangible book value. Further unlike its peers the company has no debt. Similar to peers the company is burning cash but with its stronger balance sheet and improving market share this should diminish over the next few years especially if its biosynthesis efforts pay off.

Sector Implications

If we are correct about Altria acquiring Cronos Group we believe that it could provide an immediate boost to sentiment for the entire sector. Three other Canadian LPs that have strategic partnerships could see short-term gains: Auxly (Imperial Brands) Canopy Growth (Constellation) and Organigram (BATS). In all cases we think it would be very premature to assume any sort of deal in the near-term especially for Canopy Growth which has a relatively high market cap compared to Constellation (12%) and particularly challenging near-term financial results that we think preclude acquisition at this time. We would not be surprised if other Canadian LPs were to benefit from speculation of new strategic investment partners but we believe the real beneficiary would likely be American companies. If Altria buys Cronos we believe it could accelerate the company’s efforts to make legally compliant investments into the American cannabis industry and inspire others to potentially do so as well. We believe that the larger company could also potentially acquire distressed assets in Canada as well as pursue opportunities globally.

Soon after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would be changing its name to Meta. It was a classic move. Company messes up. Company loses public favor. Company comes up with a new name and branding.

The artist formerly known as Facebook is just the latest in a grand tradition of companies that changed their name following a public scandal. Here are some other examples that paved the way.

British Petroleum to BP

Oil and gas companies generally don't have the best environmental reputations but BP takes the cake. In 2000 the oil and gas giant changed its name from British Petroleum to BP revealed a new green and yellow sunburst logo and adopted the slogan ""beyond petroleum."" This was all in an attempt to appear more environmentally friendly.

But then there was the deadly explosion of an oil refinery in Texas in 2005 the oil spill in Alaska that leaked 200000 gallons into the Prudhoe Bay in 2006 and of course the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 which was the largest oil spill in history. It turns out changing the name did not make the company more environmentally responsible.

Blackwater to Xe to Academi

Blackwater's reputation got so bad it had to change its name more than once. In 2006 a Blackwater contractor ""got drunk and shot dead"" one of the Iraqi vice president's bodyguards. In 2007 the company was sued for negligence by the families of Blackwater contractors who were killed in Fallujah. Also in 2007 Blackwater contractors opened fire in Baghdad killing 17 Iraqi civilians.

Four Blackwater contractors were convicted of the shooting and sentenced to prison and the U.S. State Department decided not to renew its contract with the company. Erik Prince (brother of former Trump White House official Betsy DeVos) stepped down as CEO and the company was renamed Xe. In 2011 Xe was acquired by a group of private investors and the company changed its name again to Academi. Now it's owned by an umbrella company called Constellis Holdings

Philip Morris to Altria

Building a business around the cool factor of a product can be a problem when the product is determined by the Supreme Court to be harmful and addictive. By 2003 people had figured out that cigarettes weren't healthy so Philip Morris one of the world's largest tobacco companies decided that it needed to improve its public image. Also it wanted a name that encompassed its other products since at the time it also owned Kraft Foods and beer company SABMiller. So it changed its name to Altria.

Did it work? Kind of. Cigarette sales in the U.S. have been in decline since 2001 so that probably hasn't been great for corporate morale. But like a chronic smoker's cough Altria didn't go away. Instead it diversified its holdings buying up smokeless tobacco and the wine company UST Inc. and investing in cannabis company Cronos Group and e-cigarette brand Juul Labs. Apparently vaping isn't very good for you either but this isn't Philip Morris' ... I mean Altria's ... first rodeo.

Lance Armstrong Foundation to Livestrong Foundation

It was a Cinderella Story. Man overcomes late-stage cancer goes on to win the Tour de France seven times in a row and dates Sheryl Crow.

Then Lance Armstrong admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs and it all came crashing down.

Armstrong's heroic story was the basis for his eponymous foundation. That and those yellow silicone bracelets that everyone was obsessed with for a while. So when it was discovered in 2012 that Armstrong cheated the foundation thought it was best to consciously uncouple. Armstrong stepped down as chairman and the foundation changed its name to the Livestrong Foundation.

The foundation never quite recovered. Revenue has dropped significantly since 2012. But with a rebrand and mission shift to funding cancer research in 2020 the Livestrong Foundation hopes to rebuild.

McAfee to Intel Security to McAfee

In 1987 John McAfee founded the eponymous company famed for its antivirus software. In the mid '90s the eccentric entrepreneur left the company and what happened after is a lot. He started a yoga retreat in Colorado then moved to Belize after losing his fortune where he built his own private military compound then he went into hiding after becoming a suspect in a murder investigation in Belize.

In 2019 McAfee tweeted that he hadn't filed a tax return in eight years and that ""taxation is illegal."" To no one's surprise he was indicted for this and not paying taxes on the millions he earned through promoting cryptocurrency speaking engagements and other income streams. In June 2021 McAfee was found dead by suicide in a jail cell in Spain where he was awaiting extradition to the U.S.

Any of these antics would have been enough to permanently damage a namesake brand. But the tipping point came in 2013 when McAfee sporting frosted tips and tribal tattoos posted a very strange and NSFW video trashing the company for how it had changed since he ran it. Owned by Intel at the time McAfee Associates changed to Intel Security Group in 2014.

But by 2016 Intel spun off Intel Security Group and the company changed its name back to McAfee. In a 2017 interview with ITBusiness.ca CTO Steve Grogan explained the decision saying ""the McAfee brand has immense value."" Despite John McAfee's best efforts to destroy the company's reputation the McAfee brand still resonated with consumers.

Perhaps this means we can expect Meta to change back to Facebook in the future?",,,,,,,,,

One of its five floors remains unfinished yet the 3.6 million-square-foot facility at the Port of Little Rock already employs more than 2000 people according to its first general manager Arkansas native Lorie White.

""We will continue to hire throughout the holiday season at this facility"" she said.

The fulfillment center is where Amazon accepts and stores products that its customers order online and where Amazon prepares each customer's package for delivery. The packages are then sent to a delivery center.

The center at the port is one of 110 in the United States and one of the three most-modern fulfillment centers Amazon operates. It is served by a delivery center on Interstate 30. A second slightly less-huge fulfillment center that handles bulky products is served by a delivery center in Maumelle.

The port fulfillment center accepted its first package on Aug. 15 but it didn't begin hitting on all available cylinders until this month White said.

The view of the facility from records at the Pulaski County assessor's office is the most impressive of any real estate in Pulaski County.

That's because there is no more valuable real estate in the county according to Joe Thompson the office's chief administrator.

""Nothing else is even close"" he said.

The assessed value of the property -- $111.7 million -- is almost twice as much as two of the next-most-valuable real-estate properties on the county's books. Those are Park Plaza mall and The Outlets of Little Rock both of which are valued around $60 million for now.

Several factors go into assessing the value of the real estate which includes the land as well as any improvements to it Thompson said.

Again it begins with its sheer size.

""It is so much bigger than anything else out there"" he said. ""Obviously it's the newest property. And it's a state-of-the-art warehouse.""

The building's value doesn't include business personal property such as furniture fixtures equipment and inventory. An inventory of its contents isn't due until May 31 Thompson said.

Given all its robotics and other advanced equipment to accept package and distribute items to deliver primarily to Arkansas customers it could well rival the value of the equipment at the L'Oreal Maybelline cosmetics plant in North Little Rock.

The cosmetics plant has the most valuable business personal property on the county's books a total of $81 million Thompson said.

The plant itself is valued at $18.1 million.

White was once an employee at the L'Oreal Maybelline facility where she worked her way up to vice president for manufacturing operations.

She is a graduate of the Missouri University of Science and Technology with a degree engineering/industrial management. The North Little Rock native attended the school on a basketball scholarship she earned while playing for Mount St. Mary Academy in Little Rock.

White is a rare leader among the managers of Amazon's 110 and counting fulfillment centers in the United States having come from the outside without previous experience at Amazon. The company's general managers usually are promoted from within the company working their way up the management ladder according to Daniel Martin a regional spokesman for the company.

What was supposed to be an hourlong tour of the fulfillment center led by White in late October ended up lasting 90 minutes. That 90 minutes covered parts of three levels -- the first and second floors as well as the mezzanine -- and allowed tour participants to work up a sweat.

Another testament to its size is how much managers and many employees walk. They walk a lot. White said she walks so much -- 8 miles a day -- that she no longer needs to go to the gym.

Carol Smith who goes by Renee is 62 and amazed at how her health improved in the few months she has worked at the facility.

""I've lost 15 pounds and I've lowered my blood pressure"" the former legal assistant said. ""I love it.""

She also is among the employees who said they applied to Amazon for the benefits. Smith who has 90 hours of college credit said she plans to take online classes starting in January to finish her degree. Amazon recently announced that it would provide full tuition to Smith and 750000 other front-line employees.

The employees made available on the tour -- the two most senior executives under White Greg Price and David Crawley -- were generally upbeat and motivated. Price a retired Air Force non-commissioned officer came from outside the company. Crawley from Chicago is moving up the company ladder. He most recently worked for Amazon in Connecticut.

Crawley is the senior leader over the inbound operations while Price is the CAP senior leader. CAP is an acronym for Count Amnesty and Pick.

Smith started as a ""picker"" and now trains other pickers or helps improve their picking rate. Pickers put together orders for customers in one of the 1000 yellow bins that flow through the massive conveyor system that snakes through the building.

Typically a picker stands at a station where an electronic reader scans information on the yellow box. That information is transmitted inside an enclosed area that takes up much of the second third fourth and when completed fifth floors.

The enclosed area on each floor is filled with hundreds of robotic wheeled platforms stacked with large shelving units called pods. They can be loaded with as much as 2 tons of products.

Once the information is processed from the information on the yellow bin the robots carrying merchandise needed to fulfill a particular order move to a picker who picks out the products and puts them in the bin. That robot will move itself out of the way to make way for another one if multiple products are in the order.

There are also sorters who help unload the trucks and sort the merchandise. Stowers load the products onto the pods.

Other employees act as counters taking constant inventory of the products so online customers can see exactly how many items are available.

Still others work on an amnesty team a role that requires them to enter the enclosed stowed area to look after a broken down robot or pick up merchandise that might have fallen from a pod. The amnesty team member is electronically tracked inside the stowed area to avoid being hit by a pod.

The work continues almost 24 hours a day seven days a week.

""We have a two-hour window in which we do some preventative maintenance on several of the days"" White said.

White celebrates her anniversary with the company this month. Even before she knew she would work for Amazon White said that given her background every time she saw an Amazon package at her front door she knew intuitively the challenge of getting it there.

The experience managing a facility from the ground up in virtually her hometown has been gratifying White said.

""It's been a lot of excitement to be able to come to Amazon"" she said. ""For me to be from North Little Rock Arkansas knowing that such a great company as Amazon is coming to the city and for me to have the ability to launch a building and make state history ... honestly it's been a ton of fun.""

(Arkansas Democrat-Gazette/Stephen Swofford)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS9pbi1wZXJ1cy1hbWF6b24tZGVmb3Jlc3RhdGlvbi1hbmQtY3JpbWUtc3dlZXAtdGhyb3VnaC1pbmRpZ2Vub3VzLWNvbW11bml0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Peru's Amazon deforestation and crime sweep through Indigenous communities,"Mongabay Latam investigated the territorial security of Indigenous communities in five regions of the Peruvian Amazon: Loreto Ucayali Pasco Huánuco and Madre de Dios.

A geospatial analysis of deforestation illegal mining and illicit coca crops in these five regions shows that 1247 Indigenous communities have been affected.

The study also revealed that 647 self-identified Indigenous communities in these five regions do not have official recognition from regional authorities to certify their existence and therefore obtain legal title to the land.

Peru is home to many Indigenous communities that don’t appear on official maps. Without government recognition these communities’ existence rests solely on their community names and on the knowledge of the federations that represent them. This is the case for the community of Manco Cápac in the Loreto region in existence for 70 years but without any documentation that can attest to it. Its inhabitants know by heart where their community’s land begins and ends.

In the Loreto region alone there are 417 self-identified Indigenous communities that do not have the recognition of regional authorities to certify their existence. The same issue exists in other Peruvian regions too: Ucayali has 122 Pasco has 85 Huánuco has 13 and Madre de Dios has 10 communities that are not officially recognized. This makes a total of 647 unrecognized Indigenous communities in five regions of the Peruvian Amazon.

However these communities’ main problem is not just their lack of government recognition. When the more than 2000 Indigenous communities in Peru — the recognized unrecognized and those in the process of recognition — are marked on a map they often overlap with areas affected within the past 10 years by deforestation illegal mining and illicit coca crops.

Mongabay Latam conducted an analysis on the impact of environmental crimes on Indigenous territories. In these five Amazonian regions the analysis found that at least 1247 Indigenous communities are affected by illegal mining illicit crops or deforestation.

Recent photography shows the communities surrounded by illegal mines that pollute their rivers with mercury; by invading loggers targeting rainforest timber; and by violent drug traffickers. Of the 54 clandestine airstrips detected by the Ucayali regional government typically associated with traffickers 15 are within Indigenous territories. Seven of the 10 environmental defenders murdered in the last year and a half are Indigenous Amazonian leaders. All seven were shot dead in incidents that their communities have linked to invaders and drug traffickers.

Six months ago a team of journalists from Mongabay Latam began compiling information from civil society organizations and from the government to analyze the incidence of environmental crimes in Indigenous communities. The team analyzed data on the legal ownership of Indigenous lands the advance of deforestation and the locations of coca crops and illegal mining camps in the regions of Huánuco Ucayali Loreto Pasco and Madre de Dios. The Mongabay Latam team then visited the communities where the data suggested the situation was most dire.

‘Ghost’ communities

The first challenge that Indigenous communities in Peru face is having to “certify” their own existence. Their vulnerability lies in the government’s difficulty in recognizing titling and registering them in official records. Public entities often show different data in terms of the number of recognized communities. “It is impossible to arrive at an exact figure” said Katherine Sánchez a legal specialist at the Peruvian Society for Environmental Law.

Unrecognized communities have less legal security. “Communal property when it is not recognized has limitations for managing projects and social programs including public services such as health care centers” said Nelly Aedo director of the Indigenous communities program at the Ombudsman’s Office.

This lack of protection is reflected in the name these communities receive in the Ministry of Culture’s database: “Locality without type identified by the DRA [Regional Directorate of Agriculture]” almost as if they’re “ghost” communities. The recognition of a native community is the first step to obtaining legal security — that is to getting a title for the communal territory.

“If you are born Indigenous you automatically have a right to the collective territory and to recognition as Indigenous people. As a consequence what pertains to the government is to recognize that right” said Ernesto Ráez executive director of the Common Good Institute (IBC or Instituto del Bien Común in Spanish). For more than 20 years IBC has worked with Indigenous communities in land use planning and environmental conservation.

Manco Cápac is one of the more than 647 communities in the regions of Ucayali Loreto Huánuco Pasco and Madre de Dios that are awaiting recognition and the right to officially titled territory.

“There are several communities to recognize. Five or 10 years ago the communities on the banks of the Amazon River said that they were campesino communities and only with time have they been identifying as Indigenous communities” said Manuel Ramírez the president of the Indigenous People’s Regional Organization of the Eastern Amazon (ORPIO).

This was an issue of discrimination Ramírez said because they felt they would have more rights as a campesino community but only later realized that this wasn’t the case. “Now they are recognized but they are not all part of a federation; if you are not in a federation you do not have the benefits of the titling projects” Ramírez said.

In Mongabay Latam’s database which holds information from official institutions and civil society organizations in Spanish 1140 communities in the five regions are listed as titled. The majority of these titled communities 742 are in Loreto. The rest are in Ucayali (255) Pasco (105) Madre de Dios (27) and Huánuco (11).

Deforestation drug trafficking and violence

In April 2020 soon after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the murder of Arbildo Meléndez marked the beginning of the violence that would erupt in the coming months. Meléndez was the president of the Indigenous community of Unipacuyacu made up of members of the Kakataibo ethnic group in Huánuco.

Four Kakataibo leaders and three Ashaninka leaders have been murdered so far this year. Kakataibo lands in both the Ucayali and Huánuco regions have become the most critical areas in terms of the presence of illegal activities especially drug trafficking.

Between 2017 and 2019 five Indigenous communities in Huánuco — Santa Martha Nuevo Unidos Tahuantinsuyo Unipacuyacu Tsirotzire and Santa Teresa — lost 16052 hectares (39665 acres) to deforestation.

Mongabay Latam journalists were able to enter Unipacuyacu very briefly. They saw the devastation in the area and used a drone to capture images of what is believed to be a clandestine airstrip. Inhabitants of the community say they live in fear.

Indigenous communities across Ucayali face a similar scenario. According to the analysis there are at least 16 Indigenous communities under the threat of deforestation caused by drug trafficking. Between 2017 and 2019 35525 hectares (87784 acres) have been affected.

Data from 2020 may paint an even direr scene as Peru lost more forest area last year than in the past 20 years. “It is scandalous” IBC’s Ráez said of the increased deforestation in Peru which exceeded the 2019 rate by 50000 hectares (nearly 124000 acres). “If we abandon the monitoring of the Amazonian biome then the defenders of those forests who are from Indigenous communities are left unprotected” Ráez said.

“During the pandemic illegality has increased a lot because while we were obedient and did not go anywhere the criminals continued to advance” said Berlin Diques president of the Ucayali branch of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest (AIDESEP).

The Ministry of Environment in a written response to Mongabay Latam’s inquiries said that “the regions where the greatest increase in deforestation has been identified during 2020 have been Ucayali Loreto and Madre de Dios compared to 2019. The drivers have been diverse. For example in Ucayali an increase in coca crops has been identified in some provinces such as in Coronel Portillo.”

The ministry also confirmed that “the Indigenous communities have perhaps been the most affected by deforestation problems in 2020. They have been more exposed and more vulnerable to several informal and illegal agents who — because of the retraction of control mechanisms due to the COVID-19 pandemic — have taken advantage of this situation.”

Community resistance

The analysis of the deforestation in the five Peruvian regions showed that around 276000 hectares (about 682000 acres) of forest were lost within Indigenous territories in the last 10 years.

In Ucayali alone 344 Indigenous communities have lost 104000 hectares (about 257000 acres) of forest in the last 10 years. Authorities from Ucayali’s regional government have also detected 54 clandestine airstrips in the region. Thirteen are in Indigenous communities and two are in Indigenous reserves.

Atalaya is home to the largest number of Indigenous communities in Ucayali around 300 and is the most affected by forest loss in the region. Many communities in Atalaya serve as buffers for protected areas like El Sira Communal Reserve.

“Communal property when it is not recognized has limitations for managing projects and social programs including public services such as healthcare centers.” Nelly Aedo

Director of the Indigenous communities program at the Ombudsman’s Office

The stories of resistance are visible on Mongabay Latam’s visualization map. Indigenous territories surrounded by deforestation appear and many of their residents have organized to defend their land. But these acts of resistance have become increasingly dangerous for them.

The threat of illegal mining

In other regions like Madre de Dios it’s possible to see the effects of another serious environmental crime: illegal mining. Reporters from Mongabay Latam traveled through San José de Karene a community in Madre de Dios which does have an official title and where the impact of illegal mining was evident. According to the analysis illegal mining has stolen 6282 hectares (15523 acres) of forest from the community.

“Today customs are no longer practiced” said Francis Quique a member of the San José de Karene governing board. “Even parents themselves do not handle this knowledge and this is being lost due to mining.

“If we lose our customs” he added “then it would not even make sense to call ourselves an Indigenous community.”

According to the analysis by Mongabay Latam despite all the efforts by the communities to tackle the issue illegal mining has impacted 129 communities in the five regions in the study.

Of the five regions in the study Madre de Dios experienced the largest percentage of land lost to illegal mining with a total of 47096 hectares (116377 acres) between 2013 and 2020.

Loreto is the region with the greatest number of communities affected by illegal mining: 84 in total. The affected land spans 278958 hectares (689320 acres) belonging to Indigenous communities.

These communities also must grapple with the lack of georeferencing and clearly defined boundaries for their territories. This allows outsiders to invade and later legalize the occupied territory. This has been the case in Catoteni and San José de Karene.

“If you are born Indigenous you automatically have a right to the collective territory and to recognition as Indigenous people. As a consequence what pertains to the government is to recognize that right” Ernesto Ráez

Executive director of the Common Good Institute

Sánchez from the Peruvian Society for Environmental Law said that “georeferencing reliably determines the limits of a community” and that having this information requires “a specific procedure just as demanding as titling. However it is necessary to execute it to avoid overlapping and border conflicts.”

“What would correspond would be to grant large territories to the communities. But we have communities that are absurdly small that cannot be sustained economically and that have been condemned in this way to poverty human misery and environmental degradation” said IBC’s Ráez.

Mongabay Latam requested an interview with the Ministry of Culture to ask about the process of titling these Indigenous communities and about their vulnerability to illegal activities. The ministry declined an interview and said the issues fell outside of its purview. Mongabay Latam then contacted the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Irrigation the entity responsible for titling rural lands but this ministry also declined an interview.

Obstacles and opportunities

Since 2013 the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Irrigation has overseen some legal matters for the land in rural and Indigenous communities according to a report by the Ombudsman’s Office. However some administrative procedures are handled by the regional governments.

In June 2021 an addendum was signed for a joint declaration between Peru Norway and Germany that seeks to reduce greenhouse gases from the deforestation and degradation of forests in the Amazon. The declaration’s goal is the legalization of at least 5 million hectares (more than 12 million acres) of Indigenous land a process that includes demarcating the territories and granting property titles. Titling land is a first step for communities to be able to access the REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) mechanism which may allow Indigenous communities to access funds to help keep their forests standing.

However the data from Mongabay Latam’s analysis paint a grim picture. Without clear protective measures from the government the outlook for the Indigenous communities in the Amazon is increasingly complicated.

With the goal of attracting mothers and working parents Amazon announced this week that workers in certain roles ranging from warehouse to delivery can cancel a shift “in as little as 16 hours” before it begins or can swap shifts with other employees at the last minute. Meanwhile Starbucks is testing a “shifts app” aimed at making it easier for employees to work available shifts to meet their personal needs. (The latter also comes as Starbucks baristas in New York state are looking to unionize.)

In recent years employers including Walmart began to offer more job flexibility amid the tight US labor market and a growing number of companies have followed. Job postings offering “flexibility” jumped from 6.4% in 2016 to 20% in 2021 according to data from ZipRecruiter. Flexibility is becoming more of a norm for all jobs in the US—and that has accelerated during the pandemic.

In a tight labor market traditional work-site employers are now competing against the growing number of remote-friendly companies says Julia Pollak a chief economist at ZipRecruiter. For instance call centers which before the pandemic required workers to make calls from a central location are now allowing them to make their calls from home. Even at jobs that require workers to be on-site some employers are allowing workers to complete administrative tasks at home she adds.

“As a result the on-site employers are having to somehow sweeten the pot and offer a little bit more flexibility because they’re losing huge numbers of workers to employers who are more flexible” she says. “If they can’t compete on space they’re competing on time.”

The unpredictable nature of low-wage jobs

Historically flexibility was not on the employee’s side. A 2015 study from the University of Chicago found retail workers reported concerns about short notice of their work schedules and unpredictable changes which would interfere with child care and other aspects of home life and contributed to turnover. Over three-fourths of both part-time and full-time employees reported receiving one week or less notice of the days and hours they would need to work according to the study.

Scheduling software focused on boosting company’s revenues such as Walmart’s in 2007 which moved workers from predictable hours to when there was customer demand. That led to workers feeling like they have no control over their schedule. In 2014 Starbucks baristas voiced objections to a system that forced them to work shifts with only a few hours break between them. Their resentment forced the coffee chain to make their scheduling practices more employee-friendly such as by preventing managers from booking employees to work shifts with less than eight hours in between.

The systems have gotten more sophisticated by integrating with software like Slack and Facebook Messenger to make communication more seamless says Jayson Saba a senior director of product management at UKG a global HR and workforce management company. The pandemic forced wider adoption.

But given how companies have used them in the past some are still skeptical of the updated scheduling practices. “Flexibility is a buzzword which really means last minute scheduling and unpredictable lives for low-wage earners” said Stuart Appelbaum president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union in an email to Quartz. “The rise of this practice is just the latest cover for long-standing scheduling issues which leave workers in precarious positions. Without fair scheduling practices workers cannot plan their lives take care of their children or elderly parents take a necessary second job or seek additional training or courses to advance their careers.”

A number of cities including San Francisco Seattle and New York City have established scheduling laws with universal standards for scheduling hourly workers in industries like retail food service and hospitality.

When the labor shortage eases the benefit could disappear says Ruth Milkman a professor at the City University of New York’s School of Labor and Urban Studies. “All that said this is definitely something workers care about… so even if it’s only due to the current labor shortage it’s good to see some effort to address it however limited” she says.

The future of low-wage work is more flexibility?

Amazon the second largest employer in the US tends to set the bar for what other low-wage employers provide their workers. The company—which raised its average hourly US wages to $18 an hour—is struggling to attract workers and in its most recent earnings call mentioned how it is spending a lot more to overcome supply chain difficulties. Flexible scheduling can help make employers like Amazon more attractive says Saba.

“Everyone is getting paid pretty much the same in these types of jobs no matter where they go” he says. “So it’s not a money piece anymore. How are we going to differentiate and how are we going to adapt to meet that? It comes down to that.”

Overall the pandemic is forcing employers to streamline their hiring process by improving how they post and advertise job postings says Pollak. “When you have to learn to attract workers in a tight labor market you have to just improve as an employer and be a better employer” she says. “And once you’ve made those improvements I don’t think you dial them back.”

It’s still in the early days but the improvements in conditions and wages of jobs that need to be done on-site can unlock huge potential for these workers. At the same time when companies switch to more flexible scheduling they often don’t see employees working less resulting in everybody working shifts that make them happier with no overall decline in productivity and higher retention says Pollak.

“It’s an exciting shift” she says. “Whenever you have this huge shift of winners and losers and the losers need to play catch up and figure out what to do it can improve outcomes for everybody.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tdXNlLWFsZXhhLXRvLXBsYXktYW1hem9uLW11c2ljLTQxNzQwOTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Get Alexa to Play Amazon Music,"What to Know Open the Amazon Music app on your mobile device and tap the Alexa icon (the speech bubble).

button again or say ""Alexa"" followed by the command. On Fire tablets access Alexa by holding down the Home button. Once you see the blue line give a music command.

This article explains how to get Alexa to play Amazon Music on Android iOS and Fire tablets. The instructions below will work for all Amazon Music subscribers whether you have access through an Amazon Prime account or you've made Amazon Music your primary streaming music service by paying the monthly service fee.

Using Alexa on Amazon Music With iPhone and iPad

You can ask Alexa to play songs from the Amazon Music app on your phone or tablet just as you would play music using an Echo device. The key to using your voice and Alexa commands to play songs is to download the Amazon Music apps for your device be it an iPhone iPad Android phone or Fire tablet.

Amazon Music for iPhone and iPad are nearly identical to one another. If you use Alexa to play music using voice commands on one you’ll have it set up on the other.

If you haven’t already start by downloading Amazon Music on the App Store then signing in using your Amazon account.

To enable Alexa inside Amazon Music:

Tap the Alexa icon found on the right side of the bottom menu. It will ask for microphone access; tap Allow. Tap OK on the iOS notification confirming microphone access

You’re now ready to ask Alexa to play music. You can tap the Alexa button and say a music command but ‘hands-free with Alexa’ is also enabled by default; as long as the Amazon Music app is open you can just say “Alexa” and it will start listening. If this setting is turned off you'll need to tap the Alexa button to issue a command.

Alexa for Amazon Music is not yet supported on PC Mac or web browsers. While there is an Amazon Alexa app focused on manipulating Echo devices you’ll want to use the Amazon Music app in most cases.

Using Alexa on Amazon Music With an Android Device

Alexa inside the Amazon Music Android app works similarly to iOS. The biggest difference being the app will ask for microphone permission when you download Amazon Music.

After downloading and launching Amazon Music simply tap the Alexa icon on the right side of the bottom menu.

Alexa inside Amazon Music isn't supported on all Android devices. If you have an unsupported device the Alexa icon will be replaced with a magnifying glass for search; you will only be able to search for music using text.

Using Alexa on Amazon Music With a Fire Tablet

If you’re using an Amazon Fire Tablet (4th generation or later) you’re in luck; because this is an Amazon device using an Amazon service (Alexa) there’s nothing to download to get started. Everything is ready to go.

Access Alexa by holding down the circular on-screen Home button. Once you see the blue line give a (music) command. Alexa will then start playing your music selection.

Tip: In addition to Fire Tablets you can use Alexa to play music using an Amazon Echo Echo Dot Echo Show Amazon Tap Amazon Fire TV Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Edition.

Try These Alexa Music Voice Commands

Alexa can play music not just by asking for a specific artist or song but from lots of other unique selections. For example you can ask about:

Genres (Rock/Pop/ R&B…)

Moods (Happy/Sad/Excited…)

Time of Day (Morning/Noon/Nighttime…)

Location (Beach/Driving/School...)

These are in addition to more standard commands like ""Play the latest from Death Cab For Cutie.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzExLzA3L3NtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In the supply chain battle of 2021 small businesses are losing out to Walmart and Amazon,"In the supply chain battle of 2021 small businesses are losing out to Walmart and Amazon

The best network to the United Kingdom Spain and Brazil

On Nov. 8 American will have more than 150 international inbound flights arriving in the United States including nearly 20 transatlantic flights. Demand on flights from LHR and Brazil are nearly 70% higher this week than the week prior. The number of international point-of-sale customers traveling in the coming week post-entry restrictions is four times higher than the week prior. Throughout the month American will operate more than 200 daily flights on nearly 200 routes to international destinations with those numbers climbing to nearly 300 daily international flights at the beginning of 2022.

American’s customers headed to Europe this winter continue filling flights to the United Kingdom and Spain where the carrier and its oneworld and Atlantic Joint Business partners offer more flights to the two countries than any other airline alliance. This includes nearly six times more flights between the U.S. and the U.K. and almost three times as many flights between the U.S. and Spain. American will also be restarting its service between DFW and Paris (CDG) as well as DFW and Madrid (MAD) earlier than expected due to increased demand. Both flights now begin on Dec. 16.

For customers seeking a warm winter getaway Brazil tops the list. American and its partners deliver more flights to Brazil than any alliance. This weekend American added more service between the United States and Brazil to meet the growing demand. The carrier added a second daily flight between MIA and Rio de Janeiro (GIG) in February just in time for Carnival. Next year customers will also have a third daily flight between MIA and Sao Paulo (GRU) to choose from in January February and March and daily service between DFW and GRU in January and February. American is the largest carrier with the most flights throughout Latin America offering nearly 30% more flights to the region than it did in 2019.

This followed a meltdown in June caused by not having enough Boeing 737 pilots. United Airlines sent an email to all its customers throwing shade at them and suggesting they book United for the holidays.

In order to prevent a repeat of the October flight attendant debacle American Airlines is throwing money at the problem (err at the flight attendants).

Lineholders will receive 150% pay (100% credit 50% pay no credit) for sequences (greater of scheduled or actual time flown) that the Lineholder actually flies on any day during the following Holiday Peak Periods: November 23 2021 through November 29 2021 and

December 22 2021 through January 2 2022. Lineholders and Reserves with a schedule who have no absences/removals from November 15 through January 2 2022 will receive an additional 150% pay for a total of 300% pay (100% pay and credit 200% pay no credit) for time flown (including standby) on any day during the Holiday Peak Periods (November 23-November 29 and December 22-January 2).

In addition and in some ways this may be the most important piece for reliability American will give crew confirmed space to fly to the start of their trips. Too many flights have been cancelled due to lack of crew because the crew couldn’t fly to their assigned trip on American Airlines – often because trips get changed at the last minute and crew were standing by for flights after nonrevs were already cleared onto planes for leisure.

Taking up revenue seats to fly employees during peak holiday periods where flights typically sell out is expensive of course but cancelling flights is also expensive.

For sequences that originate during the Holiday Peak Day Period the Company will provide inbound Positive Space (A12) travel on American Airlines mainline PSA Piedmont and Envoy to Commuters scheduled to fly a sequence/standby shift from the Commuter’s home to the Commuter’s Base for the purpose of operating the awarded/assigned sequence or standby shift. Additionally you may request positive space travel for your first and/or last scheduled Reserve Availability Period (RAP) in your reserve block that begins or ends within a Holiday Peak Period.

These moves should help deliver a reliable operation by incentivizing crew to pick up extra shifts not to call out sick for shifts when they might prefer not to work and making it possible to reach their trips in the first place.

Other work groups receive premium pay for the holidays too – this is going to be expensive.

It also underscores just how poorly American has managed its workforce and didn’t ‘keep everyone on staff and ready to fly once customers returned’ and they rebuilt their schedules which was the point of the $10 billion in direct taxpayer money they were given . At least now I suppose their spending a little bit ore of that Payroll Support 2 and 3 cash on incremental staffing (since most of the money went to payroll costs they’d have incurred anyway effectively subsidizing shareholders and creditors).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2UtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudHMtdHJpcGxlLWhvbGlkYXktcGF5LTIwMjEtMTHSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2xhYm9yLXNob3J0YWdlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnRzLXRyaXBsZS1ob2xpZGF5LXBheS0yMDIxLTExP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AA offers flight attendants triple pay to head off shortage: report,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWJyaWJlcy1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Wisely Bribes Flight Attendants To Work More,"As travel ramps up faster than new hiring American Airlines faces a dour new reality: it is constantly behind the eight ball when it comes to operations. With no room for error a local storm can ripple through the system canceling thousands of flights as we have witnessed over the last week. In an attempt to stave off repeat performances during the holidays American Airlines is wisely incentivizing flight attendants to step up using the most persuasive arrow in its quiver the green one: money.

Smart Move: American Airlines Bribes Flight Attendants To Boost Holiday Work Hours

Live and Let’s Fly has previously reported that flight attendants at American Airlines are growing weary. It goes beyond extra hours and gets to sudden schedule changes and route assignments that disrupt plans and lead to additional fatigue. But it goes even beyond that when hotel reservations and transportation are not properly lined up making a bad situation even worse.

Rather than promise that it will try harder American Airlines has reached out to flight attendants in a pair of memos on Friday promising them triple pay for working holiday flights.

The memo as noted in The Wall Street Journal promises two big incentives to work:

150% pay over peak periods during the holiday season

Triple holiday pay for those who have no absences between November 15th – January 2nd

That second point is sure to raise objections and even charges of bribery in that it encourages flight attendants to come to work sick. No doubt that it does but that’s on flight attendants not American Airlines. The 300% pay bonus will also encourage many to come to work who may otherwise just stayed with family and friends for the holidays.

Think about making 3x/month your current salary over a 47 day period. Although the two-week lead-time is small I’d certainly move appointments and obligations to make that happen.

And this is what American Airlines should have done from the start. Asking flight attendants to volunteer for extra work or endure longer duty assignments out of sense of duty and obligation is a tough sell when you can’t even arrange hotel shuttles and you also force flight attendants to be mask enforcers onboard and further pit them against passengers by offering no food or alcoholic beverages for sale onboard. This is the smarter way.

CONCLUSION

Maybe I’m too optimistic but I think this plan will work well. I think flight attendants at American Airlines will step up and even with the continuing pilot shortage and unpredictable weather this will help operations run more smoothly during the holiday period.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL25ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtYm9vc3RzLWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnRzLXBheS1haGVhZC1vZi1ob2xpZGF5LXRyYXZlbC0xMTYzNjE5MzMzNDMxOS5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1ib29zdHMtZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudHMtcGF5LWFoZWFkLW9mLWhvbGlkYXktdHJhdmVsL2FtcC0xMTYzNjE5MzMzNDMxOS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines boosts flight attendants’ pay ahead of holiday travel | Mint,"American Airlines Group Inc. said it would pay flight attendants extra to work during peak holiday-travel periods as the carrier seeks to avoid staff shortfalls that contributed to more than 2000 canceled flights last weekend and early this week.

The airline is looking to avoid another meltdown as it prepares for what many carriers expect to be a bustling holiday season.

“To ensure we’re providing certainty for both our customers and team members we’re doubling down on our efforts related to our schedule and staffing"" Chief Operating Officer David Seymour wrote in a memo to employees Friday.

Flight attendants who work during peak periods over the holiday season will earn 150% of their normal pay. And those who have no absences between Nov. 15 and Jan. 2 will receive triple pay for the hours worked during holiday periods.

American said that bad weather at its Dallas-Fort Worth hub initially triggered the cascade of cancellations last week. But the airline said staffing woes exacerbated the challenges as it burned through reserves of flight attendants and pilots and didn’t have enough crews to cover all its flying.

Airlines urged thousands of employees to take buyouts or extended leaves during the depths of the pandemic last year and haven’t yet returned to full force. They have stumbled several times in recent months as travel demand increased sharply this year catching carriers off guard. Airlines including Southwest Airlines Co. and Spirit Airlines Inc. have said they would cut back on flying plans to run more reliably.

Mr. Seymour wrote Friday that American had ensured its November and December schedules are “fully supportable by our staffing.""

Nearly 1800 American flight attendants returned from leaves of absence this week and another 800 are due to return next month which should also help boost staffing levels Mr. Seymour wrote.

The difficulties have contributed to strains between airlines and labor groups with unions alleging that carriers including American have been running without enough staff to insulate them from unexpected setbacks like bad weather.

Brady Byrnes American’s vice president of flight services acknowledged the difficulties.

“From mother nature wreaking havoc on the operation the myriad of policy changes you’ve had to keep up with and an increase in incidents of customer misconduct you’ve been dealing with a lot"" Mr. Byrnes wrote in a separate memo Friday explaining the incentive program.

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants which represents American’s flight attendants said it had negotiated the extra pay with the airline and believes it would provide some relief after a difficult period when employees faced uncertain schedules and other challenges like lack of transportation and hotel rooms.

Infrastructure provides the foundation for economic activity yet the pace of investment has fallen behind in the United States and hindered economic growth and competitiveness. From roads and transportation systems to water and waste transport to broadband to the power grid infrastructure enables the economy to function. Time and again analyses quantifying the effects of this kind of public investment show that they support economic growth. Many of the reasons that investments in infrastructure are economically usefully are direct and intuitive—a nation with bridges built to support the traffic flow clearly facilitates the transport of goods and people which is imperative to economic activity. Even so U.S. public investments have failed to keep pace with need.

The failure to invest in infrastructure creates new risks to the nation’s economy. Many of our major capital investments were made generations ago and now need maintenance. Moreover innovation has changed how work is done creating the need for new kinds of infrastructure such as access to the internet. And looming in front of the nation is the reality of climate change where investments are necessary to smooth the transition to clean energy facilitate private shifts toward climate-friendly industries and increase economic resilience.

It is for these reasons that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal which passed Congress on November 6th makes historic investments in modern infrastructure. In addition to addressing the deferred maintenance of our bridges and roads these investments will ensure that all Americans can benefit from broadband and that we make substantial progress in addressing climate change with electricity transmission public transit and electric vehicles. While the impacts of climate change make these investments urgent low interest rates also mean that they are at their most cost-effective now.

Physical infrastructure supports growth

For millennia governments have invested in basic infrastructure such as roads bridges and waterworks understanding that these investments support economic activity. Yet the United States has been falling behind. Public investment in domestic infrastructure as a share of GDP has fallen by more than 40 percent since the 1960s and the World Economic Forum now ranks the United States 13th when it comes to the overall quality of infrastructure. Dramatic examples of our nation’s aging infrastructure abound: in 2007 the I-35 bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed during rush hour killing 13 and injuring 121; in 2015 a state of emergency was declared in Flint Michigan as citizens learned that their water supply contained toxic levels of lead; and in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the harms caused to businesses and families without access to broadband internet.

Our infrastructure also fails in more routine ways. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that one out of 14 of the nation’s bridges—more than 45000—are in poor condition along with one in five miles of roads. At the same time costs of congestion are mounting. In many U.S. cities roads are congested for more than four hours each day causing travel delays and unreliability (Figure 1). In 2017 the aggregate cost of congestion for commuters reached almost $160 billion (Figure 2).

The implications of congestion go beyond productivity. More than 30000 people die in traffic accidents on U.S. roads each year and motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children. Measures as basic as improving road safety and investing in appropriate infrastructure can decrease mortality.

Routine failures of infrastructure also include the water system as lead pipes still service millions of people. Removing these pipes has important economic benefits; an analysis from the Minnesota Department of Health found that removing the two most significant sources of lead over 20 years would have benefits twice as large as the costs with improved population mental acuity and IQ ultimately increasing lifetime productivity earnings and taxes paid. Human exposure to lead has irreversible health effects; there is no safe level of exposure for children.

And while the COVID-19 pandemic made clear to businesses and families the importance of broadband internet for growing a business participating in work or attending school millions of Americans remain without access either due to high costs or limited availability in the place where they live. Even before the pandemic researchers found that broadband internet adoption in rural areas had economic benefits potentially increasing income growth the number of firms and total employment numbers while decreasing unemployment growth.

In an analysis of 68 studies between 1983 and 2008 economists find that across various kinds of infrastructure for each 10 percent increase in public capital supplied at the central government level national output grew by 0.8 percent in the short run and 1.2 percent in the long run. Much of this effect is through supporting productivity: one analysis finds that a 1 percent increase in public capital investments in core physical infrastructure had a 0.24 percent increase in productivity. At the same time public investment in infrastructure spurs private investment; Pereira (2001) estimates that a public investment of $1 into electric and gas facilities transit systems and airfields leads to a $2.38 increase in long-term private investment.

Many of the economic gains of infrastructure are concentrated at the bottom of the income distribution meaning that infrastructure investment can help promote equity. By one estimate a 1 standard deviation (7 percentage point) increase in the growth rate of public investment in highways over a decade would erase almost two-thirds of the increase in income inequality observed between 2000 and 2010. Another study concludes that increasing infrastructure spending from 2 percent to 5 percent of GDP increases the wealth share of the bottom quintile from 3.95 percent to 4.49 percent.

Infrastructure investment is critical for climate resilience adaptation and the facilitation of green technologies

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal confronts the reality that the United States needs infrastructure that mitigates and adapts to the immense projected damages of climate change. This requires helping U.S. communities increase their resilience to climate change while also facilitating a move to net zero carbon emissions. After all infrastructure is necessary to support the growth of clean energy technologies and therefore to the success of the broader Build Back Better agenda.[1]

Hurricane Ida a category 4 storm that hit New Orleans in August of 2021 provides a striking example of the importance of resilience and the ongoing need for continued investment. Despite the severity of Ida flooding was actually limited due to a new storm protection system installed by the Federal government in the wake of Hurricane Katrina which caused a humanitarian catastrophe—and over $100 billion in damages—when the city’s levees failed. Importantly however shortcomings in the city’s electricity grid meant that millions lost power and hundreds of thousands remained without it for days leading to at least nine deaths caused by excessive heat during the power outage and producing repair costs estimated at over $2 billion.

The power outages in the wake of Ida as well as the Texas freeze in early 2021 that left roughly 10 million Texans without electricity and cost an estimated $155 billion nationwide highlight the need to modernize the nation’s electric grid. One Department of Energy study finds that power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $150 billion annually. Without careful planning these costs to the electricity grid will grow due to the increased frequency and severity of extreme events caused by climate change. Investments in electricity transmission can unleash the full potential of renewable energy by enabling more power to be delivered to urban centers from the windiest and sunniest parts of the country and in turn save households money and make the economy more resilient. One estimate finds that investments in the eastern U.S. transmission grid could reduce energy bills by at least 33 percent.

Reforming the transportation sector is also critical to addressing climate change. In 2019 29 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions came from transportation. In order to meet President Biden’s climate goals and mitigate damages in the coming decades the United States will need to move away from fossil fuel-powered vehicles and towards public transit and rail and electric vehicles (EVs).

While EVs are increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel-powered cars their market shares remain in single digits. For those interested in purchasing electric vehicles a major barrier is the relatively limited availability of charging stations. Strategic investment can greatly increase the share of people whose car needs can be fulfilled with electric vehicles. Consider Norway where the Federal government has committed to supporting EVs; last month over three-quarters of total car sales were electric.

Promoting access to public transit can also support the transition to a net zero carbon economy. One estimate from the Department of Transportation (DOT) finds that U.S. bus transit emits an estimated 33 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile than the average U.S. personal vehicle. The same DOT study finds investments in hybrid electric buses would further decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

Reducing emissions not only addresses climate change but also supports health and well-being in ways that will improve productivity now and far into the future. School buses for example make up 80 percent of all buses in the United States and the majority run on diesel which emits exhaust fumes that are detrimental to human health and can cause asthma. Electrifying the entire U.S. school bus fleet would not only reduce overall bus emissions by 35 percent per year but in doing so improve the current well-being and future productivity of American students who would inhale cleaner air on their ride to school. Austin et al. (2019) estimate that retrofitting an entire school district’s fleet of diesel buses to reduce emissions by 60 to 90 percent can increase English test scores by 0.14 standard deviation when all students ride the bus.

Why now?

Infrastructure reform is long overdue. We are not only living with broken 20th century roads and bridges but are missing out on the advances of 21st century such as state-of-the-art automation and fast broadband. Failing to make these investments hurts the competitiveness of American businesses and the economic security of American families. Now is also the time to invest in infrastructure that supports the move to net zero carbon emissions. By one estimate every decade of delayed action on climate change doubles the cost of decarbonization.

Already the United States is paying a high price for delaying action to stand up the infrastructure necessary to address climate change. The last seven years have been the warmest on record and 2020 was tied for the warmest single year on record. Economic damages from climate change come in multiple forms including more intense hurricanes that cost billions of dollars in damages every year drier and hotter conditions that make forest fires more likely and warmer weather that reduces crop yields. In 2020 major extreme weather and climate events cost the United States $100 billion. This summer nearly one in three Americans lived in a county hit by a weather disaster. Americans pay for the costs of extreme weather directly by for example fixing flooded basements but also indirectly by facing mounting insurance costs.

Climate action also provides other benefits including for health. Heat exposure alone is estimated to cause 12000 premature deaths annually in the continental United States 37 percent of which (between 1991 and 2018) were attributed to anthropogenic climate change. By the end of the century deaths from heat exposure are expected to increase by 36000 per year in a moderate emissions scenario and 97000 per year in a high emissions scenario. And local air pollution produced by fossil fuel combustion causes premature death exacerbates existing health conditions (especially among lower-income groups and communities of color)—which can lead to higher infant mortality —and reduces worker productivity

Reducing the risks of climate change has important equity implications. Because climate change tends to hit low income regions and individuals harder it widens existing economic inequality. In one study estimating the economic damage of climate change in the United States the poorest decile of counties is projected to suffer median losses that are 9.5 times larger than the richest decile of counties when losses are measured as a percentage of baseline income.

Now is also the time to make these investments from a financing perspective. The costs of borrowing remain at historic lows. Real interest rates—the yield on U.S. Treasury securities less observed inflation—are the price the government pays to borrow money from the private sector which includes both households and firms. For the first time since 2013 real 10-year interest rates on U.S. treasury securities have remained below zero for over a full year. Considering that new government debt would go towards increasing long-term growth the downsides of increasing the debt are small in comparison to the benefits of this much needed infrastructure. As the 2022 Federal Budget lays out the burden associated with the debt is the level of interest payments; given low interest rates additional capital investments would be affordable. Low rates are also a signal of the market’s confidence that the U.S. government will continue to pay its debts on time.

Though under some circumstances deficit-financed funding can decrease long-term output by crowding out private investment the current availability of funds for private actors signals that crowd-out is unlikely. Low rates indicate that there is sufficient supply of capital to meet demand and that businesses are not struggling to find funding. In fact corporate profits are at an all-time high (up 37 percent since the fourth quarter of 2019) another indication that debt-servicing costs are not prohibitive. All of this suggests that markets are willing to lend funds to the government so that it can make economically important investments.

Conclusion

Investments in America’s infrastructure have the potential to boost long-run productivity and deliver broad-based economic growth that reaches communities across America. Importantly these investments also can advance climate resilience and reduce inflationary pressures. The country cannot continue to thrive in the 21st century with ailing 20th century infrastructure. The time is now to make these investments.

But above ground a cluster of tents has risen in the Northern Nevada desert where for eight months environmental and tribal activists are protesting plans to mine it for “green” technologies.

“We are not leaving until this project is canceled” said Max Wilbert of the Protect Thacker Pass campaign. “If need be this will come down to direct action. We mean to put ourselves in between the machines and this place.”

Plans to dig for the element known as “white gold” have encountered a surge of resistance from tribes ranchers residents and activists who say they believe the repercussions of the mine will outweigh the lithium’s contributions to the nation’s transition to less-polluting energy sources than fossil fuels.

The opponents view lithium extraction as the latest gold rush and fear that the desperation to abate the climate crisis is driving a race into avoidable environmental degradation. The flawed assumption behind the “clean energy transition” they argue is that it can maintain levels of consumption that are inherently unsustainable.

“We want people to understand that ‘clean energy’ is not clean” Wilbert said. “We’re here because our allegiance is to the land. It’s not to cars. It’s not to high-energy modern lifestyle. It’s to this place.”

Proponents of the mine maintain its potential to address climate change and develop a rich domestic economy around a resource that is currently produced almost entirely outside the United States justify its environmental consequences and potential burden on local communities. Most mainstream environmental organizations and activists while recognizing the significant environmental burdens from mining for elements required for the energy transition see them as necessary to wean the world off of the fossil fuels that are driving global warming.

Lithium is essential for batteries to power electric vehicles (EVs) and to store energy produced by renewable but intermittent sources like wind and solar. But getting it can have environmental impacts that draw similar pushbacks to those associated with the extraction of fossil fuels—a conundrum that is taking center stage as the mining of minerals critical to new energy technologies comes to the U.S. in a major way for the first time.

“The tension between the local environmental and social impacts of mining and the demand for critical minerals is a worldwide problem not just a challenge in the USA” said Elizabeth Moses Environmental Rights and Justice Associate with the Center for Equitable Development at the World Resources Institute.

At the Thacker Pass camp activists who call themselves “radical environmentalists” hope that addressing these challenges will press nations to choose to drastically reduce car and electricity use to meet their climate goals rather than develop mineral reserves to sustain lifestyles that require more energy.

Controversial Development in a Contested Landscape

In January 2021 the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved the Thacker Pass Lithium Project granting Lithium Americas a multinational company headquartered in Vancouver British Columbia and its subsidiary Lithium Nevada the exclusive rights to mine there. Soon afterward Will Falk an environmental lawyer representing local tribes and Max Wilbert an organizer set up an encampment at the site of the proposed mine.

The activists are allied with the local Paiute-Shoshone tribes ranchers and concerned residents. Hundreds of supporters gather at the protest camp for events such as native-led “prayer runs” through towns and rural landscapes to finish at the pass.

Despite its name and the fact that it is also developing a lithium mine in Argentina Lithium Americas’ majority stakeholder is China’s Ganfeng Lithium the world’s largest producer of the element.

The proposed project spans 17933 acres that would hold an open-pit mine and a sulfuric acid plant to process lithium from the raw ore. The mine is expected to have a lifespan of at least 46 years. The mine operations at Thacker Pass will emit 152713 tons of carbon dioxide annually equivalent to the emissions of a small city according to its Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). It is expected to consume 1.7 billion gallons of water each year—500000 gallons of water for each ton of lithium—in an arid region that is experiencing worsening droughts.

According to BloombergNEF global demand for lithium chemicals will reach nearly 700000 tons a year by 2025. Thacker Pass is expected to produce 60000 tons a year.

Lithium Americas claims they have established Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) standards to meet the world’s increasing demand for sustainability in business but they do not specify their measures or methodologies for them. A representative for the company commented by email that “Thacker Pass is designed to meet or exceed all state and federal requirements during construction operation and reclamation” and will meet limitations on air and water pollution which were assessed in the FEIS required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Opponents engaged in ongoing litigation against the project claim the FEIS was rushed and failed to meet obligations specified under NEPA.

“Places like Thacker Pass are what gets sacrificed to create that so-called clean energy” Wilbert said. “It is easy to say the sacrifice is justifiable if you do not live here.” Wilbert rejects claims that such trade-offs are necessary for the greater good.

“I look at this as the paradox of green growth” said Chris Berry an independent energy analyst who is on the Lithium Americas board. “There is no free lunch. To do this I half-jokingly say that everyone is going to be unhappy. We have to get over the NIMBY mindset.”

Moses at the World Resources Institute in Washington sees the roots of such opposition as more complex. “Historically mining communities have lacked access to information or been denied a voice in policy decisions despite having the legal right to engage in most countries” she said. “Overall we need better transparency and accountability across the entire supply chain to ensure that mining communities aren’t asked to bear the brunt of the transition to the net-zero carbon economy. These communities need our support including targeted tools and strategies that ensure they can protect their environment cultural traditions and livelihoods.”

Newfound Enthusiasm for EVs But Some Question Their Benefits

Whatever processes are required the demand for lithium is most likely immutable. “Lithium mining is going to happen somewhere [in the U.S.]” said Ian Lange associate professor at the Colorado School of Mines who served as Senior Economic Advisor to the Trump Administration. “If not Thacker Pass it’ll be another place.”

In President Biden’s February 2021 Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains the administration vowed to bring back more manufacturing and mining to the United States as part of its effort to develop lithium-ion batteries. The order said the administration would work to identify domestic sites where “critical” minerals could be mined and Congress to increase funding for the U.S. Geological Survey to map such resources. Currently the majority of the world’s lithium is mined in Australia and South America and more than 97 percent of it is refined in China.

President Biden’s American Jobs Plan includes $174 billion to promote electric vehicles and EV charging stations. In March The U.S. Department of Energy announced policy actions to scale up a domestic manufacturing supply chain for advanced battery materials and technologies including a commitment of 24.5 million toward research and development of new private-public partnerships that “will focus on linking raw materials processing with supply chains and cell manufacturing aiming to reduce battery costs” said Michael Berube deputy assistant secretary for sustainable transportation in DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in a recent webinar.

In August President Biden announced plans to sign a non-binding Executive Order calling for electric vehicles to make up 40-50 percent of new auto sales in the United States by 2030 and he has called the government’s investment in EVs a “race for the future.”

In addition to creating jobs the investment is part of the administration’s efforts to combat climate change. By 2030 the administration is committed to reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent from 2005 levels. Transportation contributes almost 30 percent of those—the largest direct source among all U.S. sectors—with cars and light-duty trucks responsible for 59 percent of vehicle emissions according to the International Energy Agency.

But despite the reduction in emissions that the widespread adoption of EVs would bring the Center for Interdisciplinary Environmental Justice at the University of San Diego an organization of concerned scientists who monitor harms to communities from mining opposes the electrification of transportation. Their analysis shows that in order to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide at 450 ppm by 2050—parts of gas per million parts of air—industrialized countries’ greenhouse gas emissions would have to decrease by 80 percent. Electric cars the center’s researchers concluded would achieve just 6 percent of that target leading them to argue that driving electric vehicles is not a radical enough behavioral change to significantly slow climate change.

Exactly how much CO2 electric cars save compared to combustion cars is calculated based on the amount of CO2 emitted when electricity is produced or fuel is burned as well as the emissions of the resource extraction for batteries. A Department of Energy-funded a life cycle analysis (LCA) by the Argonne National Laboratory looking at this scope with both types of vehicles found electric vehicles must travel approximately 13500 miles before they become “cleaner” than a comparable vehicle burning fossil fuels. A similar study was done by the nonprofit European Federation for Transport and Environment and concluded that “electric cars in Europe emit on average three times less CO2 than equivalent petrol/diesel cars.” Differences in life cycle assessment for electric cars result from the varying ways electricity is generated for the power grids that the vehicles plug into in different countries as well as where the vehicles’ batteries are sourced.

Globally fewer than 1 percent of passenger cars on the road today are electric but analysts at IHS Markit project that by 2035 they may make up a quarter of all new sales and 13 percent of vehicles on the road as gasoline cars are phased out.

Unusual Hazards Lead to Legal Actions

There is a litany of concerns about the plans to build a lithium mine at Thacker Pass with the various groups opposing it highlighting different issues. For many locals the biggest concern is Lithium Americas’ plans to build a plant at the mine site that will convert molten sulfur into sulfuric acid which is used to leech the lithium from the raw ore.

Every day the operation would burn hundreds of tons of sulfur trucked in from as far away as the Alberta oil sands. Residents are concerned about the possibility of accidents and spills along the narrow highway between Winnemucca and Thacker Pass which would be traveled by an estimated 75 tractor-trailers a day. Spills of molten sulfur in places like Florida and Washington state have seeped into the ground and permeated the air while sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide worsen asthma and contribute to particulate matter linked to heart and lung disease.

Locals voiced their fears about emissions from the sulfuric acid plant in public meetings held by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection but Jeff Kinder chief engineer in the Bureau of Air Pollution Control at NDEP said he believes state standards will provide adequate protection to nearby residents.

“The company will be required to do continuous emission monitoring” he said.

Many locals like Jennifer Cantley an organizer with Mom’s Clean Air Force a Nevada group that works with politicians to safeguard against pollution said she believes any contaminated air from the plant is too much. “It scares me how quickly they did this” she said. “This is my home. This will affect my family. I can’t let up.”

“The enormous piles of waste that would be dumped from the use of sulfur makes the fact that they call this a ‘green project’ really bizarre” rancher Edward Bartell said. The most hazardous waste from the sulfur plant would be transported to Clean Harbors a disposal facility located in Reno according to the FEIS. The tailings from the mining waste—about 353 million tons—would be placed in a permanent lined storage facility on-site according to the FEIS.

But the sulfur is just one of Bartell’s problems with the mine.

In early February 2021 Bartell who owns 50000 acres of property adjacent to Thacker Pass sued the BLM alleging the mine violates the Endangered Species Act and NEPA. His complaint filed in Nevada’s U.S. District Court alleges that the mine could reduce streamflow enough to endanger Lahontan cutthroat trout which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists as a threatened species—and the BLM failed to consult the USFWS about that possibility the complaint says.

“There’s been an enormous concern with protecting cutthroat trout with the BLM not allowing cattle to graze near the stream” Bartell said of rules he had to follow to safeguard the fish. He said when the mine was proposed the BLM reclassified the stream as “ephemeral” meaning it doesn’t flow all the time which allowed it and its fish to receive different protections than they had previously. The baseline data recorded in the FEIS did not accurately portray how the stream flows he said complaining that there are no long-term gauges to monitor it.

His lawsuit claims that approval of the Thacker Pass Mine was “based on a Final Environmental Impact Statement that was inaccurate incomplete and contained misrepresented data.” It cites an Environmental Protection Agency letter to the BLM from January 2021 that criticized the BLM’s failure to analyze impacts on water quality and ensure that mine operations didn’t violate water quality standards. According to the BLM’s FEIS Lithium Americas plans to pump 1.7 million gallons of water from the aquifer each year which could leave less water to support the grasslands Bartell’s cattle graze.

The lawsuit also cites EPA predictions that toxic water with high levels of uranium mercury arsenic and more than a dozen other contaminants could seep into groundwater from the tailings and other mine waste.

According to the EPA letter “…the plans are not developed with an adequate level of detail to assess whether or how groundwater quality downgradient from the pit would be effectively mitigated.”

The sulfur compounds could degrade water quality both underground and in the air said Dr. Alexander More a professor of environmental health at Long Island University. “As the EPA pointed out the list of expected toxic water pollutants is clearly no one’s favorite recipe” More said. “These are all major components of acid rain. In a drought region the groundwater risks being polluted by toxic metals while whatever little rain the area may receive will be polluted by acid emissions which will impact farming and drinking water not to mention the wildlife and plants. And the projected greenhouse gas emissions are no joke either.”

Sacred Space and Critical Habitat

Bartell’s lawsuit is not the only one attempting to stop the mine. In late February 2021 four regional environmental nonprofits—the Western Watersheds Project Great Basin Resource Watch Basin and Range Watch and Wildlands Defense—filed suit against the Department of the Interior BLM and Ester McCullough district manager for the BLM’s Winnemucca office. The lawsuit claims that the project does not comply with the Resource Management Plan in Thacker Pass for greater sage grouse—a ground-dwelling bird on the verge of being listed as threatened whose populations have fallen into decline in areas with other types of energy development.

The greater sage grouse is just one of the species that will be impacted by the mine said Terry Crawforth former director for the Nevada Wildlife Department. From his porch in the Kings River Valley he gestures toward inactive “sleeper” mines in the Montana Mountains that are still considered toxic after their operators failed to clean them up.

“When ducks fly over and touch down they are dead the next morning” he said. He fears more of the same from Lithium Americas. “The way the mine is designed right now it will destroy the local culture especially if they suck up all the water and pollute it.”

Crawforth helped organize residents from Orovada and Kings River Valley into the Thacker Pass Concerned Citizens. He has arranged several meetings between them and Lithium Americas largely over safety measures for traffic and the local school in a process facilitated by Collaborative Decision Resources Associates a mediation firm for “contentious” land projects.

“Of course if we thought there was a chance to halt the mine we would try” Crawforth said. But “it is inevitable” he said and negotiating to reduce the harms of the project is their only available recourse now.

“We’ve been here for over 100 days and we’re not leaving until this project is canceled” said Max Wilbert one of the Protect Thacker Pass campaign leaders. Credit: Max Wilbert

This area is “the last large sagebrush piece left for animals in Thacker Pass” he explained. According to the Great Basin Resource Watch it is an important linkup of wildlife habitats in the Double H Mountains and the Montana Mountains. The mine would degrade nearly 5000 acres of pronghorn antelope winter range and 427 acres of their summer range as well as sever two critical pronghorn migration corridors according to the FEIS. It contains essential Greater sage-grouse habitat golden eagle nests and it is the last known place where the Kings River pyrg a rare spring snail endures. “They will remove the habitat and with it many critters” Crawforth said.

Lithium Americas has responded to concerns about the mine’s impacts on wildlife with plans that include “advanced revegetation technologies” developed with the Greater Sagebrush Restoration Fund at the University of Nevada Reno and possible mitigations such as retrofitting utility poles to make them less likely to kill birds and to reduce the productivity of a pair of golden eagles that nest in the area.

Rulings in both lawsuits are expected in January 2022 by U.S. District Court Judge Miranda Du in Nevada. On Sept. 3 the judge denied a preliminary injunction requested by area tribes to halt archeological digging by a Lithium Nevada contractor to remove cultural artifacts that would be disturbed by the mine following a BLM-approved plan. The tribes’ lawsuit alleged that the agency violated the National Historic Preservation Act in permitting the mine near a site where there is evidence of the massacre of at least three Paiutes by federal troops in 1865. Will Falk the lead attorney in the case and a founder of Protect Thacker Pass said the BLM did not attempt “good faith” consultations with those who hold the site sacred and “handpicked” a few tribes that were suffering from the coronavirus pandemic knowing they’d struggle to respond.

“For Native Americans this is a government-sanctioned way to loot our artifacts” said Michon Eben Cultural Resource Specialist for the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony. “The treatment plan is based on discriminatory language and is in direct disrespect to our history.” Tribal members are usually brought to the actual sites and digs to counsel on the whereabouts of artifacts and burial grounds and to help ease the overall disturbance she said.

“We did not hear about this mine until it was too late and none of our tribal members have been asked to advise at the time of digging” Eben said. “What they are calling adequate consultation is the fact that the BLM sent three letters to three different tribes.” Eben noted there are at least 15 tribes that attach spiritual significance to Thacker Pass.

The Protect Thacker Pass campaign and People of the Red Mountain are calling on Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland the nation’s first Native American cabinet secretary to intervene.

Alexi Zawadzki president of North American operations for Lithium Americas responded to the ruling in a statement: “Respecting the interests of Native American tribes is extremely important to us which is why we have engaged with the Fort McDermitt Tribe since 2017…And we’re just getting started. We are committed to working alongside anyone in the community.”

A Rushed Process or a Race to Riches

With Lithium Americas promising cooperation Kinder at NDEP’s Bureau of Air Pollution Control said that officials are used to working with mining executives. “We always have new industry coming” he said “And there are many regulations we have to get up to speed on but this permitting process doesn’t feel that different from our normal course of business.”

But the environmental review process took less than a year to complete due in part to a Trump-era revision to the National Environmental Policy Act that put a 12-month cap on permitting reviews. According to research done by Cambridge University the average Environmental Impact Statement is put together over the course of 3.4 years. The final leasing permit was issued in the last days of the Trump Administration.

The EIS process was also conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic which limited community meetings. Many locals said they didn’t learn about the proposed mine until the public commenting period had ended.

Most supporters of the project reside in Winnemucca a city of about 7500 people about an hour’s drive from Thacker Pass. Mining has long been a dominant employer there and locals know the new project means jobs. The company predicts it will bring approximately 1000 construction jobs to the region for two years and employ an operational staff of about 300.

RV parks and temporary housing units line the edges of the small city. These “man camps” fill up and empty out with the booms and busts of local mines.

People of the Red Mountain a group at the Fort McDermitt Reservation opposing the mine said in a press release: “This will lead to an increase in hard drugs violence rape sexual assault and human trafficking. The connection between man camps and missing and murdered indigenous women is well-established.”

County Commissioner Dave Mendiola sees lithium mining and clean-energy technology as a means to diversify the economy but sympathizes with opponents’ concerns.

“I guess you can chain yourself to the fence like some of the protesters might do and I don’t blame them for that” Mendiola said “but in the end as a company if they’ve followed all the rules you’re probably not going to stop it. What we can do as a county is monitor it and come up with ways to address problems now.”

Humboldt County Sheriff Mike Allen a sixth-generation Nevadan said he’s seen bar fights and drug crimes rise with the opening of mines and plans to increase patrols to deal with the potential influx of hundreds of lithium miners. But he added “there is no doubt in my mind we can call a meeting and the company will hear what the community is saying.”

At one of the community meetings held by the company in Orovada in April Tim Crowley the vice president of government and community relations for Lithium Americas’ Nevada division and the former head of the Nevada Mining Association addressed the attendees. “Our goal is to be a good neighbor” Crowley said. “We’re confident that there will be more development beyond the 46 years so we will be here for a very long time. The only way to be a good neighbor is to listen to you and accommodate wherever we can.”

Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation is the nearest tribal community to the proposed mine about 26 miles away. Representatives from Lithium Nevada approached the tribal council there in 2020—while the community was struggling with Covid—to initiate the “engagement agreement” a process typically undertaken by mining companies operating on or near tribal lands. Maxine Redstar then the tribal chairperson said she hoped the mine would provide well-paid work for some of the roughly 340 people on the reservation.

“More than 40 members of the Fort McDermitt tribe have expressed interest in high-wage jobs that Thacker Pass will bring” wrote Lithium Americas’ Zawadzki at the time.

But last March the tribal council withdrew from the community engagement agreement with Lithium Nevada after being presented with a petition opposing the mine signed by the majority of the reservation members according to Myron Smart a reservation member and spiritual leader for the community.

“The agreement with the company was signed by the council behind closed doors” said a Fort McDermitt reservation member who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation. “Everything related to the mine was hushed up. The decisions of the council do not reflect the beliefs of the community.” The council did not return requests for comment.

“We’ve always welcomed input from our neighbors and in return we strive to communicate regularly and openly about our progress at Thacker Pass” Zawadzki wrote in response to the judge’s ruling allowing excavation of cultural sites to proceed. “It’s this neighborly approach to doing things right that will lead to cultural preservation good jobs and exciting economic opportunity.”

For some tribal leaders those promises ring hollow.

“Offering well-paying jobs at a lithium mine is like the coal miners in Virginia who had to breathe coal dust” said Reno-Sparks Indian Colony Chairman Arlan D. Melendez. “If that’s the only job to feed your family you’re going to take it even if it means sickness or a shorter lifespan. The greater situation of failing reservation economies has never been addressed other than with undesirable jobs that harm our health.”

With the failure of the tribes’ lawsuit and uncertainty about those that will be decided in January the coalition of tribal members ranchers and environmentalists gathering at the Thacker Pass encampment expect protests against the lithium mine to escalate and the backlash against the energy transition it would feed to grow.

“Electric cars simply cause a different sort of harm: instead of the Gulf Oil Spill we have the bulldozing of an increasingly rare desert habitat” wrote Wilbert the Protect Thacker Pass organizer and author. “To save the planet we have to stop destroying. A wound is a wound is a wound.”

EPA challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants.

The case presents an opportunity for the Court to overturn key climate precedents and potentially change the relationship between federal agencies and Congress. The decision could have far-reaching consequences for federal climate policy and perhaps even for federal agencies more broadly.

How did we get here how far might the Court go and what consequences might the case have for climate change regulation and executive branch authority?

EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases: Massachusetts v. EPA

In a groundbreaking decision in 2007 the Supreme Court held 5-4 that EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. During the Bush administration environmentalists petitioned the agency to issue a rule on the regulation of greenhouse gases. The Bush EPA denied the petition and environmental groups states and local governments challenged that decision in court. The Supreme Court’s decision turned on whether greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide fall under the definition of “air pollutants” which the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate.

The Court concluded that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act’s definition and also noted that the EPA cannot refuse to regulate greenhouse gases for policy reasons outside the Clean Air Act itself as the Bush administration had done. The Court ordered EPA to either issue a finding that greenhouse gases are dangerous to the public health and welfare the first step toward regulation or to give a reasoned explanation for why greenhouse gases do not meet the threshold of endangerment outlined in the Clean Air Act. The agency ultimately found that greenhouse gases are dangerous to the public health and welfare which formed the foundation for EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gases.

That Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA was a 5-4 decision and environmental advocates leading up to it were not at all certain that they would win the case. In fact the case was controversial at the time because many environmentalists worried that it would result in a harmful adverse ruling. The four liberals on the Court in 2007 Justices Souter Ginsburg Breyer and Stevens were joined by Justice Kennedy to form a majority. But Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas Scalia and Alito dissented.

Chief Justice Roberts’s dissent (joined by Justices Scalia Thomas and Alito) argued that the states local governments and environmental groups challenging the EPA should not have been allowed to sue in the first place because they lacked standing: One requirement of standing is a “concrete and particularized” injury. Chief Justice Roberts argued that harms from climate change affect everyone so the injury in question was not sufficiently individualized and personal to support a lawsuit.

Justice Scalia’s dissent (joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas and Alito) focused on the Clean Air Act and argued that the Act is meant to address conventional air pollutants that harm human health directly through exposure such as inhalation. He maintained that the Act was not meant to address the broader issue of climate change and that greenhouse gases therefore did not fall under the definition of “air pollutants.”

Of course the Supreme Court’s composition has changed significantly since 2007. With a 6-3 conservative-liberal divide the conservative dissenters’ objections to Massachusetts v. EPA may now represent the majority view.

The ‘worst case scenario’: What could West Virginia v. EPA bring?

There are reasons to expect that the Court will show restraint when it hears the upcoming challenge to EPA’s authority in the West Virginia v. EPA case. But first let’s walk through the worst potential outcomes from the perspective of climate advocates.

As suggested above the Court could overturn its decision in Massachusetts v. EPA and effectively take away EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases. With such a ruling EPA could no longer issue rules directly regulating greenhouse gas emissions and past greenhouse gas rules issued under its Clean Air Act authority would be invalid.

Richard Lazarus a Harvard Law School professor who recently wrote a book about Massachusetts v. EPA called the Court’s decision to hear West Virginia v. EPA “the equivalent of an earthquake around the country for those who care deeply about the climate issue.”

The consequences of the case could even reach far beyond climate regulation. The case presents an opportunity for the Court to revive the “nondelegation doctrine” a mostly defunct principle that purported to limit Congress’s authority to delegate legislative power to executive branch agencies. The doctrine comes from Article I of the Constitution which says that “[a]ll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.” The Supreme Court has not used the nondelegation doctrine to strike down agency action in more than 80 years.

Implications of enforcing nondelegation doctrine

The practical consequences of enforcing the nondelegation doctrine would debilitate the current system of executive branch rulemaking and regulation subject to judicial review and congressional oversight. If Congress were to do all the rulemaking currently done by EPA for instance environmental regulation would become virtually impossible to enact. Congress in that case would have to make thousands of granular and technical decisions about environmental policy even though we know it can barely pass major legislation as it is.

More broadly nondelegation could mean that much of the work done by all federal agencies would have to be done instead by a clearly ill-equipped Congress. Even without current gridlock on Capitol Hill the sheer volume of policy decisions Congress would have to make would be completely unworkable.

While this outcome sounds unlikely and illogical to those who support federal agency regulation several of the current Justices at various times have expressed interest in weakening the administrative state and deregulating industry. For them the nondelegation doctrine may be an attractive principle.

Notably for instance in a case called Gundy v. United States in 2019 four of the conservatives (Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Gorsuch Thomas and Alito) showed a willingness to revisit the nondelegation doctrine. At that time Justice Kennedy had retired and Justice Kavanaugh had not yet been confirmed so the case was 4-4. With Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett now on the court there appears to be some chance that reviving the nondelegation doctrine would garner the support of five or even six Justices.

The petitioners – West Virginia and North American Coal Corporation – that brought the appeal in West Virginia v. EPA explicitly suggested that this case could be an opportunity for the Court to reconsider nondelegation: “Nothing in the statute [the Clean Air Act] approaches the clear language Congress must use to assign such vast policymaking authority – assuming of course it can delegate enormous powers like these in the first place.”

In short the worst-case scenario from the perspective of climate action advocates is that the Supreme Court takes away the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases and also revives the nondelegation doctrine which would strip most federal agencies of much of their regulatory power.

Reasons for a less sweeping outcome

Let’s now consider some reasons the Court may be unlikely to completely overturn Massachusetts v. EPA or fully embrace the nondelegation doctrine.

First Chief Justice Roberts and increasingly Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch appear keenly mindful and protective of the Court’s reputation and legacy. They have tended to look out for the public perception of the Court and avoid decisions that would have provoked especially strong public backlash. Recent examples include upholding the Affordable Care Act and civil rights protections for the LGBT community.

These cautious impulses may be heightened by the looming threat of court reform which could gain more momentum if a particularly controversial conservative decision were issued. Given the strong public backlash likely to result from a decision taking away EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases and/or reviving the nondelegation doctrine the Court may proceed with caution.

The Court’s precedents in other fossil fuel cases provide another reason for a more limited approach. Massachusetts v. EPA created the basis for the Court to deny other lawsuits based on the harms fossil fuels cause.

In American Electric Power v. Connecticut the Court heard a public nuisance challenge to greenhouse gas pollution. Public nuisances are acts conditions or conduct that interfere with the rights of the public generally. Connecticut’s nuisance claim rested on federal common law a form of judge-made law. Judge-made law can be displaced by laws passed by Congress. The Court decided that because Congress had already granted EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act Congress had displaced judge-made law in this area. If the Court were to overturn Massachusetts v. EPA completely public nuisance challenges could be brought against fossil fuel companies again an outcome conservative Justices are likely to want to avoid.

Finally even if EPA – and therefore the executive branch agencies as a whole – were to lose authority to regulate greenhouse gases directly under the Clean Air Act it could still indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by targeting co-pollutants that fall more squarely under Clean Air Act authority. For instance greenhouse gas emissions are often accompanied by particulate matter nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides volatile organic compounds and air toxics. By regulating those co-pollutants EPA can bring down greenhouse gas emissions without exercising any direct regulatory authority over them. Of course if the Court fully embraces the nondelegation doctrine EPA’s authority to regulate those other pollutants could also be jeopardized. But as mentioned above some Justices may stop short of such a decision in light of concerns about the Court’s legacy and risks of a backlash.

In short while the Supreme Court’s decision to hear West Virginia v. EPA creates plenty of anxiety for climate advocates there are also reasons to think that the Court will not fully overturn Massachusetts v. EPA. And even if the Court takes away EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases the agency may still have other avenues available for bringing down emissions. A broader embrace of the nondelegation doctrine would pose more sweeping problems for environmental regulation but the Court’s recent cautious approach to hot-button issues suggests it is more likely to make only incremental changes to that doctrine.

WASHINGTON D.C. – Kevin Dempsey president and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) issued the following statement in response to the House of Representatives’ passing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA):

“American steel built this country and the industry is now ready to get to work on rebuilding this country. Repairing and modernizing our national transportation system is essential and we are glad Congress agrees. This bill would ensure that our infrastructure system meets the need of the 21st century. Funding roads and bridges ports and waterways water infrastructure the electric grid and investing in electric vehicle systems all will require a lot of steel —and our industry is ready to provide that steel. Passing this bill today provides a tremendous boost to our industry as demand for American steel could increase by as much as five million tons for every $100 billion of new investment.

“This bill will also make sure that taxpayer funds are used to procure cleaner steel produced in the United States where it is made with a lower carbon and energy intensity than steel made in the other leading steel-producing countries. We are thrilled that in the end Congress was able to take this important step toward funding our nation’s infrastructure needs. We look forward to President Biden signing the bill into law very soon.”

View the current offers here.

The Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card and the Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card are top-notch products for Delta flyers. They both have heightened welcome offers (through Nov. 10 2021) and come with valuable travel perks like priority boarding and free checked bags.

Their value propositions diverge after that however. The Amex Delta Reserve comes with a substantially higher fee than the Amex Delta Platinum for good reason.

Should Delta Platinum cardholders look to make an upgrade to the Reserve? Let's examine five reasons you might want to upgrade to the Amex Delta Reserve and outline the most strategic way to go about it.

Why you should upgrade to the Amex Delta Reserve

Fantastic airport lounge access

Acquiring airport lounge access is one of the most powerful steps you can take to improve your travel experience. A handful of travel credit cards offer airport lounge access as a card benefit and the Amex Delta Reserve is one of them. Here's what you'll get:

Delta Sky Club access whenever you have a same-day Delta flight

2 single-use Delta Sky Club guest passes

Amex Centurion Lounges are the gold standard among domestic U.S. lounges. They serve free hot meals and mixed drinks and some even offer spa services wine tasting and family rooms.

Delta Sky Club lounges also tend to be above-average among legacy U.S. carrier lounges in my opinion.

By contrast the Amex Delta Platinum won't get you into Centurion Lounges and you'll have to pay to use Delta's SkyClubs.

Improved companion certificate

The Amex Delta Reserve comes with a companion certificate after each account anniversary. You can use this for one round-trip Delta flight in:

First class

Delta Comfort+

Main cabin

You'll only be charged the taxes and fees (no more than $75) on your companion ticket. This companion fare is only valid within the 48 contiguous United States (unless you live in Hawaii Alaska Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands).

The Amex Delta Platinum only allows you to redeem your companion certificate for a round-trip main cabin flight. If you manage to use your Delta Reserve's companion certificate for a fancier seat you could save hundreds of dollars over the Delta Platinum offering.

Better flight perks

The Amex Delta Reserve makes you eligible for a complimentary seat upgrade even if you don't have elite status. And if you do have elite status the card ensures your upgrade will have priority over other members of the same elite status level.

Easier path to elite status based on spending

The Amex Delta Reserve earns 15000 MQMs after you spend $30000 up to four times in a calendar year. That means you could earn up to 60000 MQMs after spending $120000 — a huge boost toward Delta elite status. This is 40000 more MQMs than you can earn purely through spending on the Amex Delta Platinum.

Cardholders with either product will receive an MQD waiver for Silver Gold or Platinum Medallion status after spending $25000 on eligible purchases in a calendar year (a waiver for Diamond status requires $250000 of spending in a calendar year).

As a reference here's what it takes to earn Delta elite status:

Silver: Earn 25000 MQMs or 30 MQSs and $3000 MQDs or MQD waiver

Gold: Earn 50000 MQMs or 60 MQSs and $6000 MQDs or MQD waiver

Platinum: Earn 75000 MQMs or 100 MQSs and $9000 MQDs or MQD waiver

Diamond: Earn 125000 MQMs or 140 MQSs and $15000 MQDs or MQD waiver

Note that both the Delta Reserve and Delta Platinum offer a 25% boost on MQMs earned through spending in 2021.

How to upgrade to the Amex Delta Reserve

If you desire you can ""product-change"" your Amex card to a card in the same family. For example you can ask American Express to swap your Amex Delta Platinum into another personal Amex Delta card. Some cardholders prefer to do this because they keep the same account and card number. Simply call the number on the back of your card and ask American Express to upgrade your Delta Platinum to a Delta Reserve.

However this may not be the best idea particularly with Amex for one main reason: Amex gives you the opportunity to earn a welcome bonus only once — and you won't earn a welcome bonus when you product-change. Instead of upgrading your card to the Amex Delta Reserve you could apply for the Amex Delta Reserve and earn the welcome offer plus all its accompanying perks and benefits and get rid of your Amex Delta Platinum later.

You're still welcome to upgrade your existing Amex Delta Platinum but you'll be forfeiting a welcome bonus worth several hundred dollars in Delta flights.

Bottom line

The Amex Delta Reserve is worth considering over the Amex Delta Platinum for frequent Delta flyers because of its excellent airport lounge access improved companion certificate and fast track to elite status.

The Amex Delta Platinum is far from a slouch — but if you travel on Delta with regularity the lounge access and elite status perks alone might be worth the upgrade to the Amex Delta Reserve.

The event was attended by hundreds of members and friends at the site in the Ottoville area and was broadcast live to other stake centres around American Samoa.

Alamoana Fidow Maeva serves on the American Samoa National Communications Council and helped with the event.

“During this week of so much preparation we have been amazed by how much we all felt the love and the mercy of our dear Heavenly Father for his children in American Samoa” she said.

She asked several other Church members how they felt about the new temple.

Faaletaua Forgetmenot Saili was a member of the Temple Groundbreaking Committee.

She said “God truly knows that American Samoa needs a temple especially during these trying and difficult days. I have seen the hand of the Lord from the beginning of our preparations leading up to the day of the groundbreaking. Usually it always rains during this time of the year but it was a really beautiful day. Tender mercies indeed.”

Jody Toleafoa Meleisea played violin for the choir during the ceremony. She also serves as the Relief Society president of the Pago Pago Central stake.

“Having our very own temple here in the Territory inspires and uplifts my spirit and tells me that God always answers prayers and that He remembers us even ‘on the isles of the sea’” she said.

“The spirit was so strong throughout the ceremony with inspired talks and heavenly music. I have no doubt that our ancestors and family members on both sides of the veil were present.”

“I was grateful that my wife and my son were able to be part of the turning of the soil” said Jason Seitoga Magalei President of the Pago Pago Samoa Mapusaga Stake.

“It is my hope and prayer that as we turned the soil for the temple that the members of my stake will also symbolically continue to turn their hearts to the temple and our Savior Jesus Christ.”

Salu Hunkin-Finau was also a member of the groundbreaking committee and a speaker on the program.

“I think this new temple is going to create greater understanding of the Church in our community. As our friends and neighbors see us doing family history and doing temple work for our ancestors it will help bring our community together spiritually.""

“This is a moment for eternity” said Jay Leonard Maeva from Pago Pago Central Stake. “It is the work glory that we give to the Lord. Families will be united under God forever - husbands and wives children to their parents lost and loved ones.”

“For this day to finally arrive the flood gates could not be restrained neither could my joy. It was so spiritually uplifting from the beginning to the end that one had to be there to witness the heavens open and see the light over that sacred ground” said Shirley De La Rosa.

Rachel Tuiolosega serves as a family history consultant in the Pago Pago Malaeimi Stake.

“I know that the spirit will be felt on a greater scale here and this is our opportunity to share what the feeling is. What is that feeling? It is the spirit of Elijah who came to turn our hearts” she said.

Leata Hunt watched the event from Utah. “As a young convert to the Church in American Samoa my widowed mother worked two jobs but could never afford to pay for me to attend youth baptisms at the temple in Apia. When it was announced that there would be a temple here I remember crying tears of joy. I thought of every youth in American Samoa that has never had the privilege to attend a temple baptism session. My heart was overjoyed and gave thanks to the Lord for his love grace and tender mercies.”

Vagana Siaosi Liuvaega is from the Tui Pago Samoa Stake. “It is beyond words of how grateful I am to have this blessing upon our island after people sacrificed all these years travelling to Apia to visit the Temple. I am grateful that I will have the chance to strengthen my testimony stay worthy and I will offer all my time to serve Him as a temple worker at our island temple.”

Mikayah Si’ufanua is a project engineer for the temple. “The reason I studied construction was because of my grandfather who was one of the pioneers to help build a lot of the buildings for the Church in the South Pacific. I am so grateful for this opportunity to be part of the construction management team to continue the legacy of my grandfather in building the kingdom of God. I felt his presence at the groundbreaking ceremony. That gave me strength and a confirmation that God lives and knows us by name. He is in the details of our lives.”

“As I watched the ceremony I thought about the revelations to Joseph Smith about building the temple in Kirtland. I can’t wait to see our new temple and to sacrifice my time working inside the sacred house of the Lord” said Mainifo Iutita Mulitalo Seiuli from Pago Pago Malaeimi Stake.

William and Sisi Spitzenberg have been called as temple construction missionaries and will assist in the building process over the next few years.

William said “I remember in my youth how I always looked forward to going to the temple in Apia. The challenge was finding money to pay to travel there. My brothers and I would do yard work for my Aunty Logotaeao Hirata who was so kind to pay for all our fares and give us pocket money each year so we could do baptisms for the dead. It was such a sacred experience and one that I always looked forward to. As an adult my wife and I try to attend the Apia Samoa temple as often as we can each year.”

Sisi said “I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of the temple groundbreaking event. It's been an amazing feeling. It gives me hope that one day I will have my parents who are not members of the Church take part in the temple open house. After Saturday these are the three words that came to mind: hope ancestors and courage. It will be up to us as members to fill up this temple by doing our part.”

Tina Fonoimoana Reid attended with her husband Adney who is the president of the Pago Pago West Stake. Her grandfather Opapo was a pioneering member of the Church in American Samoa.

“The groundbreaking ceremony was an event that I will never forget” she said. “I don’t know that I’ve ever felt the Spirit so strongly for such a prolonged amount of time. For me it was as if the heavens opened that day. I felt the support and love of my ancestors who sacrificed so much with hopes this would one day come to pass. I imagined my own posterity standing on that holy ground for generations to come to partake of the blessings of the temple.”"

The best network to the United Kingdom Spain and Brazil

On Nov. 8 American will have more than 150 international inbound flights arriving in the United States including nearly 20 transatlantic flights. Demand on flights from LHR and Brazil are nearly 70% higher this week than the week prior. The number of international point-of-sale customers traveling in the coming week post-entry restrictions is four times higher than the week prior. Throughout the month American will operate more than 200 daily flights on nearly 200 routes to international destinations with those numbers climbing to nearly 300 daily international flights at the beginning of 2022.

American’s customers headed to Europe this winter continue filling flights to the United Kingdom and Spain where the carrier and its oneworld and Atlantic Joint Business partners offer more flights to the two countries than any other airline alliance. This includes nearly six times more flights between the U.S. and the U.K. and almost three times as many flights between the U.S. and Spain. American will also be restarting its service between DFW and Paris (CDG) as well as DFW and Madrid (MAD) earlier than expected due to increased demand. Both flights now begin on Dec. 16.

For customers seeking a warm winter getaway Brazil tops the list. American and its partners deliver more flights to Brazil than any alliance. This weekend American added more service between the United States and Brazil to meet the growing demand. The carrier added a second daily flight between MIA and Rio de Janeiro (GIG) in February just in time for Carnival. Next year customers will also have a third daily flight between MIA and Sao Paulo (GRU) to choose from in January February and March and daily service between DFW and GRU in January and February. American is the largest carrier with the most flights throughout Latin America offering nearly 30% more flights to the region than it did in 2019.

The full-scale outline of a U.S. carrier and at least two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are part of the target range that has been built in the Ruoqiang region in central China. The site is near a former target range China used to test early versions of its so-called carrier killer DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles according to press reports in 2013.

This new range shows that China continues to focus on anti-carrier capabilities with an emphasis on U.S. Navy warships. Unlike the Iranian Navy’s aircraft carrier-shaped target in the Persian Gulf the new facility shows signs of a sophisticated instrumented target range.

The carrier target itself appears to be a flat surface without the carrier’s island aircraft lifts weapons sponsons or other details the imagery from Maxar shows. On radar the outline of the carrier stands out from the surrounding desert – not unlike a target picture according to imagery provided to USNI News by Capella Space.

There are two more target areas representing an aircraft carrier that do not have the metaling but are distinguishable as carriers due to their outline. But other warship targets appear to be more elaborate. There are numerous upright poles positioned on them possibly for instrumentation according to the imagery. Alternatively these may be used for radar reflectors to simulate the superstructure of the vessel.

The facility also has an extensive rail system. An Oct. 9 image from Maxar showed a 75 meter-long target with extensive instrumentation on a 6 meter-wide rail.

The area has been traditionally used for ballistic missile testing according to a summary of the Maxar images by geospatial intelligence company AllSource Analysis that identified the site from satellite imagery.

“The mockups of several probable U.S. warships along with other warships (mounted on rails and mobile) could simulate targets related to seeking/target acquisition testing” according to the AllSource Analysis summary which said there are no indications of weapon impact areas in the immediate vicinity of the mockups. “This and the extensive detail of the mockups including the placement of multiple sensors on and around the vessel targets it is probable that this area is intended for multiple uses over time.“

Analysis of historical satellite images shows that the carrier target structure was first built between March and April of 2019. It underwent several rebuilds and was then substantially dismantled in December 2019. The site came back to life in late September of this year and the structure was substantially complete by early October.

China has several anti-ship ballistic missile programs overseen by the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force. The land-based CSS-5 Mod 5 (DF-21D) missile has a range of over 800 nautical miles. It has a maneuverable reentry vehicle (MaRV) to target ships. The larger CSS-18 (DF-26) has a range of around 2000 nautical miles.

“In July 2019 the PLARF conducted its first-ever confirmed live-fire launch into the South China Sea firing six DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles into the waters north of the Spratly Islands” according to the Pentagon’s latest annual report on China’s military. The Chinese are also fielding a longer range anti-ship ballistic missile that initially emerged in 2016.

“The multi-role DF-26 is designed to rapidly swap conventional and nuclear warheads and is capable of conducting precision land-attack and anti-ship strikes in the Western Pacific the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea from mainland China. In 2020 the PRC fired anti-ship ballistic missiles against a moving target in the South China Sea but has not acknowledged doing so” reads the report.

In addition to the land-based anti-ship ballistic missiles China has a program to equip the People’s Liberation Army Navy H-6 bombers with a massive anti-ship ballistic missile. First revealed in 2018 the CH-AS-X-13 will likely be the largest air-launched missile in existence and would be large enough to accommodate a hypersonic warhead.

Another possible launch platform for anti-ship ballistic missiles is the new Type-055 Renhai Class large destroyer. Described as a guided-missile cruiser it will be capable of carrying anti-ship ballistic missiles according to the Pentagon report.

It’s not the first time China has built an aircraft carrier target in the desert. Since 2003 a large concrete pad roughly the size of a carrier has been used as a target. The slab which is part of the Shuangchengzi missile test range has been hit many times and is frequently repaired. The new site in the Taklamakan desert is 600 miles away and is much more evolved. The newer ship targets are closer approximations of the vessels that they are supposed to represent.

While questions remain on the extent of weapons that will be tested at the new facility the level of sophistication of what can now be seen at the site show the PLA is continuing to invest in deterrents to limit the efficacy of U.S. naval forces close to China – in particular targeting the U.S. carrier fleet.

According to the Pentagon report released last week a primary objective of the PLARF will be to keep U.S. carriers at risk from anti-ship ballistic missiles throughout the Western Pacific.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evd2h5LXRoZS11cy1zdXNwZW5kZWQtZXRoaW9waWEtbWFsaS1ndWluZWEtZnJvbS1mcmVlLXRyYWRlLWRlYWwvNjMwMjQ0Ni5odG1s0gFnaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3doeS10aGUtdXMtc3VzcGVuZGVkLWV0aGlvcGlhLW1hbGktZ3VpbmVhLWZyb20tZnJlZS10cmFkZS1kZWFsLzYzMDI0NDYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why US Is Suspending Ethiopia Mali Guinea From Free-Trade Deal,"In response to human rights violations the United States announced this week that it plans to suspend Ethiopia Mali and Guinea from duty-free access to American markets as of January 1.



U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement to Congress released Tuesday that these nations were no longer in compliance with the eligibility requirements for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). He cited various examples of their failure to defend internationally recognized human rights.



What is the AGOA?



The AGOA was enacted by Congress in May 2000 with the intention of enhancing sub-Saharan African countries' access to the U.S. market.



Nations that qualify under the act are afforded several key benefits most importantly preferential access to the U.S. market for more than 6000 products. Through the removal of import duties on these products beneficiaries obtain competitive advantages over other nations.



To qualify for the AGOA nations must meet eligibility requirements outlined in section 104 of the act including working toward improving their rule of law defending human rights and respecting international labor standards.



Each year the U.S. determines which nations qualify for the AGOA benefits and the president grants or withdraws beneficiary status at his or her discretion.



Why did the administration cut off access for Ethiopia Mali and Guinea?



The Biden administration said that unconstitutional developments in Mali and Guinea threatened their eligibility for the program.



According to the president's statement Mali has not established or made ""continual progress toward establishing the protection of the rule of law political pluralism and internationally recognized worker rights."" It also has not addressed ""gross violations"" of ""internationally recognized human rights"" Biden said.



In Guinea the government failed to establish protections for the rule of law and political pluralism the statement said.



The Biden administration also withdrew Ethiopia's benefits under the AGOA for ""gross violations of internationally recognized human rights"" the president said.

Ethiopia's suspension was the result of the ongoing civil war in the northern Tigray region that has spurred a serious human rights crisis. Since the conflict started a year ago international concern has grown over human rights abuses including mass killings of citizens and widespread sexual violence.



How are these countries reacting?



Following President Biden's announcement Ethiopian government spokesperson Legesse Tulu said that the government had already commented on the issue Reuters reported.



Legesse stated on Twitter on October 3 that suspension from AGOA would cost the country 1 million jobs.



The governments of Mali and Guinea have not released statements on Biden's decision.



How significant is the deal to each country's economy?



Given the benefits posed by the AGOA suspension from the act may have important implications for each country's economy.



Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world with a low-income highly undiversified economy according to the World Bank.



In 2020 amid the pandemic the country fell into a recession.



According to the World Bank Guinea is another of the world's poorest countries. The pandemic significantly slowed economic growth in the country causing it to contract by 1.4% in 2020.



Neither Mali nor Guinea have been major exporting nations under AGOA.



But Ethiopia was the fifth top exporting nation under the act according to U.S. International Trade Commission data.



Under AGOA the Horn of Africa nation exported $245 million worth of goods to the United States last year representing half of its total shipments to the American market Bloomberg reported.



While Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in Africa with a per capita income of $850 it has the fastest-growing economy in the region according to the World Bank.



In a statement Tuesday top U.S. trade negotiator Ambassador Katherine Tai said that the U.S. ""urges these governments to take necessary actions to meet the statutory criteria so we can resume our valued trading partnerships.""



Tai also stated that she will provide each country with benchmarks for a path toward the reinstatement of their AGOA benefits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMDcvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4td2FyLW1hcmluZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Young Marines in Kabul Were Left to Run Final Days of Evacuation,"The Marines at Abbey Gate were racing against time. The crowd at the gate didn’t know it but the Marines had been told to close it at 6 p.m.

That left just 30 minutes for Capt. Geoff Ball 33 commander of 2nd Battalion 1st Marines’ Ghost Company to pluck out a few more people with that elusive combination of affiliation and luck that would get them onto a plane out of Afghanistan. Just 30 more minutes for Cpl. Hunter Lopez 22 to grab another child out of the sewage canal where hundreds jostled. Just 30 minutes for Capt. Andres Rodriguez 31 to scan the crowd for men who fit the descriptions in dozens of text messages from people in the United States trying to save their interpreters.

The plan for the final “retrograde” of the American war in Afghanistan was clear: On Aug. 26 the British troops stationed at the nearby Baron Hotel would fall back. A few hours later the 82nd Airborne would take up the Marines’ forward positions allowing Ghost Company to fold into the terminal. And finally the 82nd Airborne would fall back to the airport to waiting planes ending America’s longest war.

They had been coming by bus car and foot for 10 straight days assembling near the jersey barriers or standing knee-deep in the foul-smelling canal near Abbey Gate a main entryway to the airport.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZWlnbnBvbGljeS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNi9saWJlcmlhLWZpcmVzdG9uZS1ydWJiZXItY2FwaXRhbC11cy13YXItcmV2aWV3LWdyZWdnLW1pdG1hbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Empire of Rubber' Uncovers Firestone Liberia's Importance to U.S. History,"In a critique of West Africa’s Liberia in 1958 the Black American sociologist and commentator W.E.B. Du Bois commented that “a body of local private capitalists even if they are Black can never free Africa; they will simply sell it into new slavery to old masters overseas.”

In a critique of West Africa’s Liberia in 1958 the Black American sociologist and commentator W.E.B. Du Bois commented that “a body of local private capitalists even if they are Black can never free Africa; they will simply sell it into new slavery to old masters overseas.”

At the time Liberia had the second highest economic growth rate in the world. Liberia’s open-door policy had seen private foreign capital investment boom in the postwar period as companies were granted land concessions and given tax breaks incentivized by low wages and low regulation. Despite these impressive growth rates though “a handful of American-owned companies and about 1000 Americans working in Liberia [made] more money in Liberia than all Liberians put together.”

Gregg Mitman’s Empire of Rubber: Firestone’s Scramble for Land and Power in Liberia is a fascinating and enlightening page turner that uncovers Liberia’s often overlooked importance in U.S. history. Without Liberia founded by U.S. settlers in the 19th century the Allies would not have been able to produce enough rubber to win World War II. In 1944 Firestone Rubber was the largest employer in all of Liberia. And without the investment of Firestone Liberia’s independence and its status as the only Black sovereign state in Africa would have been threatened by Britain France and Germany. How did a Black republic and Firestone a manufacturing firm from Akron Ohio find their fates so intertwined?

Sovereignty was at the heart of a dilemma faced by both the United States and Liberia. By the end of the 19th century Britain France and the Netherlands had all colonized places in tropical climates suitable for establishing rubber plantations leaving U.S. manufacturers dependent on foreign imports. When at the end of World War I the British and Dutch imposed new restrictions on exports and new price minimums companies like Firestone reached out to the U.S. government to seek support for plans to establish rubber plantations in places friendly—or beholden to—the United States: The Philippines and various options in Latin America were floated but ultimately Liberia was chosen.

This choice came about Mitman shows through a combination of history lobbying and luck. Black American emigrants had settled in the region from as early as 1821 sent by the controversial American Colonization Society. Despite strong opposition to the American Colonization Society’s project from a “majority” of Black people 10000 Black Americans settled in dispersed towns along the Liberian coast by the end of the 19th century. Liberia inaugurated its first government as an independent republic in 1848 though it retained a special relationship with the United States.

Meanwhile as Mitman explains with devastating clarity in a world of expanding empires Liberia sought out financial capital that would enable it to retain independence and self-governance—but which wound up tying it into Britain’s sphere of influence and debt. “How could the country remain sovereign in a world ruled by the power of white capital and Western imperialism?” Mitman asks. Was strategically ceding economic sovereignty to maintain political control the right choice?

As a Black republic Liberia had not only strategic economic importance to Americans but also symbolic political importance. An independent and flourishing Black republic could demonstrate to the world that Black people were not inferior. This argument was not merely theoretically important. Deep-seated racism backed up by so-called race science dominated geopolitics at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. During that time the rest of Africa was colonized and racial codes like Jim Crow laws as well as laws restricting immigration flourished in white majority countries. The prevailing racial arguments rested on notions of white superiority that pointed to specific markers of “civilization” and development. Because places that had a Black majority were deemed underdeveloped backward and “uncivilized” white people were deemed to have a moral duty to improve them in ways Black leaders were deemed incapable of doing. Poverty and skin color were seen to be one and the same.

U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt is welcomed to the Firestone rubber plantation during a trip to Liberia in January 1943.

Liberia stood out as a hope to people across the political spectrum—from the radical activist Marcus Garvey to the more moderate Du Bois and the conservative author Booker T. Washington—because it was self-governing and demonstrated Black people could be equals in the world of sovereign states.

But true sovereignty had to come with proof of development and development was only possible through investment. This search for financial capital was the real goal for Liberia—one that would have been familiar to many states at the time. From the late 19th century both Britain and France hoped to take territory formally claimed by Liberia (and as Mitman regularly reminds readers taken by Liberian settlers from people belonging to the Vai Dei Gola Kru Kpelle Bassa Loma Kissi Gbandi Sapo Mano Mende Mandingo Gio and Kuwaa). The accusations Britain and France made to justify this included that Liberia was underdeveloped and didn’t have a big enough government to effectively occupy and improve the whole territory it claimed.

Enter Garvey the Back-to-Africa proponent and radical activist who offered Liberia capital raised through bonds sold in his Black Star Line to clear British debts. This was not as straightforward a proposal as it might seem though. Du Bois and other Liberian advocates raised questions about its feasibility and also about Garvey’s intentions. Garvey had targeted the Liberian political and economic elite as being corrupt and insular while ignoring the rest of the Liberian population’s poverty. Du Bois worried that questioning Liberia’s governance would give white governments an excuse to take control of the country.

Firestone offered another option for both the United States and Liberia. An independent source of rubber would provide security to U.S. manufacturing supply chains. Private finance would give Liberia more bargaining power and prevent its takeover by another government. Both Firestone and Liberia hoped to outwit the financiers who were profiting from the status quo. After several years of negotiations investigations and government lobbying an agreement was reached in 1926. Firestone would pay an annual rent of $1 an acre (and 6 cents per acre for additional land leases up to a million acres) to the Liberian government as well as pay 2.5 percent on all rubber sales and agreed not to import unskilled labor. But Harvey himself inserted a last-minute addition of a $5 million loan—an attempt to tie the U.S. government’s interests to his company’s. Mitman recounts that “Firestone told members of Congress that a private loan supported by American diplomatic pressure and guns if necessary was the best means to ensure adequate protection” of his investment. Du Bois had hoped Firestone would “allow in Liberia decent and increasing wages” and the “Liberian government satisfactory revenue.” He was disappointed when the government was ultimately strong-armed into an agreement where it retained judicial control but little else.

The conflict between Garvey and Du Bois is representative of one of the most appealing aspects of Mitman’s writing. The range of characters he introduces are all drawn as full and fascinating individuals with complex politics. The book makes a compelling case that representation alone is rarely enough—either at the national or individual level—in that it has not necessarily advanced the conditions of the economically oppressed. Many Black politicians diplomats and educators who were invested in Liberia’s promise were educated at Harvard University Columbia University Howard University the London School of Economics and Political Science and other elite institutions. They were newspaper reporters entrepreneurs sociologists historians agricultural experts anthropologists diplomats politicians and financiers. Liberia’s very existence furnished the United States with the opportunity to send its best and brightest Black talent into “solving” this intractable international relations and development puzzle.

For instance there was William Francis the U.S. consul to Liberia at the end of the 1920s who began the U.S. State Department’s secret investigation into the country’s use of forced labor. And Lester Walton who had “little patience for critiques of capitalism calling for liberation of Black labor from white oppression through working-class revolution.” An active member of New York’s Democratic Party and the person responsible for encouraging U.S. newspapers to “print the word Negro with a capital N” Walton was involved with Firestone’s bid to “save Liberia” from exploitation by Liberia’s ruling elite. The accusations divided opinions. Should the United States intervene on humanitarian grounds in support of exploited workers undermining Liberia’s sovereignty? Or was it better as Du Bois found himself reluctantly arguing to ignore the exploitation and support the country’s broader claim to sovereignty?

The Liberian administration was not without guilt. Labor was one of the few forms of “capital” it could access freely without creating international dependency. Also like other governments of the time—including the United States—the Liberian government used forced and conscripted labor for construction projects like building roads and clearing land. The ruling elite passed laws that favored their own class and looked the other way at their blatant corruption. The country’s development undoubtedly reflected stark conditions of inequality. But as Liberia’s advocates regularly pointed out these statements were also true of Africa’s European empires—and were equally true of the United States itself.

The perpetual question of either race or class interest’s superiority came to a head during the Cold War. The group of Liberian capitalists who established their own rubber plantations alongside Firestone—and who were therefore economically aligned with Firestone’s goals in the country—found themselves facing down labor unrest from economically exploited workers. Liberian President William Tubman who had the largest rubber plantation outside of Firestone control used martial law to put down a strike at Firestone in 1950. But at the same time the Firestone premises were segregated with even Black diplomats and Liberian officials denied access to some white-only spaces. During the 1960s and into the 1970s that alliance shifted as Pan-African movements the development of international arguments for the Black Power movement and anti-colonial sentiment combined with labor activism to push Tubman’s successor William Tolbert Jr. to finally renegotiate the terms of concessionary arrangements like Firestone’s. But it was too little too late.

Mitman’s narrative illustrates a pattern in the battle between government and private capital. First Britain provided the capital to allow Liberia to be truly independent. Firestone would then be the savior because it would eliminate Liberia’s reliance on foreign government loans. The Liberia Company a joint-venture mining operation that ran from the end of World War II until 1962 was proposed to rescue the country from dependence on Firestone. The company was part of a broader set of interventions supported by U.S. President Harry Truman’s post-World War II Point Four Program which sought to rescue Liberia through a “concept of partnership and social responsibility.” And then Tubman’s open-door policy would free Liberia from any potential neocolonial dependency on the United States during the Cold War.

The book makes clear the stark choices faced by all kinds of places where capital is in short supply. There are obvious modern parallels to campaigns by cities and states to recruit Amazon warehouses through tax incentives or different countries to compete over tax or regulatory regimes in a bid to attract multinational corporations. Throughout the brilliantly told narrative Mitman highlights some of the possible exit strategies Liberia has had along the way. Garvey’s Black Star Line was one. An agricultural expert named Frank Pinder sent by the Truman administration after World War II presented another. He proposed a shift away from monoculture and concessions and toward Liberian-led commercial agriculture following traditional farming practices.

The passage of the 2018 Land Rights Act championed by rural women is the latest source of hope. And in it Mitman sees the promise of a Liberian economic and political future focused on sustainable growth and development. The enduring tension between international capital and sovereignty he proposes can be overcome by a focus on community sovereignty and local investment instead.

Infrastructure provides the foundation for economic activity yet the pace of investment has fallen behind in the United States and hindered economic growth and competitiveness. From roads and transportation systems to water and waste transport to broadband to the power grid infrastructure enables the economy to function. Time and again analyses quantifying the effects of this kind of public investment show that they support economic growth. Many of the reasons that investments in infrastructure are economically usefully are direct and intuitive—a nation with bridges built to support the traffic flow clearly facilitates the transport of goods and people which is imperative to economic activity. Even so U.S. public investments have failed to keep pace with need.

The failure to invest in infrastructure creates new risks to the nation’s economy. Many of our major capital investments were made generations ago and now need maintenance. Moreover innovation has changed how work is done creating the need for new kinds of infrastructure such as access to the internet. And looming in front of the nation is the reality of climate change where investments are necessary to smooth the transition to clean energy facilitate private shifts toward climate-friendly industries and increase economic resilience.

It is for these reasons that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal which passed Congress on November 6th makes historic investments in modern infrastructure. In addition to addressing the deferred maintenance of our bridges and roads these investments will ensure that all Americans can benefit from broadband and that we make substantial progress in addressing climate change with electricity transmission public transit and electric vehicles. While the impacts of climate change make these investments urgent low interest rates also mean that they are at their most cost-effective now.

Physical infrastructure supports growth

For millennia governments have invested in basic infrastructure such as roads bridges and waterworks understanding that these investments support economic activity. Yet the United States has been falling behind. Public investment in domestic infrastructure as a share of GDP has fallen by more than 40 percent since the 1960s and the World Economic Forum now ranks the United States 13th when it comes to the overall quality of infrastructure. Dramatic examples of our nation’s aging infrastructure abound: in 2007 the I-35 bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed during rush hour killing 13 and injuring 121; in 2015 a state of emergency was declared in Flint Michigan as citizens learned that their water supply contained toxic levels of lead; and in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the harms caused to businesses and families without access to broadband internet.

Our infrastructure also fails in more routine ways. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that one out of 14 of the nation’s bridges—more than 45000—are in poor condition along with one in five miles of roads. At the same time costs of congestion are mounting. In many U.S. cities roads are congested for more than four hours each day causing travel delays and unreliability (Figure 1). In 2017 the aggregate cost of congestion for commuters reached almost $160 billion (Figure 2).

The implications of congestion go beyond productivity. More than 30000 people die in traffic accidents on U.S. roads each year and motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children. Measures as basic as improving road safety and investing in appropriate infrastructure can decrease mortality.

Routine failures of infrastructure also include the water system as lead pipes still service millions of people. Removing these pipes has important economic benefits; an analysis from the Minnesota Department of Health found that removing the two most significant sources of lead over 20 years would have benefits twice as large as the costs with improved population mental acuity and IQ ultimately increasing lifetime productivity earnings and taxes paid. Human exposure to lead has irreversible health effects; there is no safe level of exposure for children.

And while the COVID-19 pandemic made clear to businesses and families the importance of broadband internet for growing a business participating in work or attending school millions of Americans remain without access either due to high costs or limited availability in the place where they live. Even before the pandemic researchers found that broadband internet adoption in rural areas had economic benefits potentially increasing income growth the number of firms and total employment numbers while decreasing unemployment growth.

In an analysis of 68 studies between 1983 and 2008 economists find that across various kinds of infrastructure for each 10 percent increase in public capital supplied at the central government level national output grew by 0.8 percent in the short run and 1.2 percent in the long run. Much of this effect is through supporting productivity: one analysis finds that a 1 percent increase in public capital investments in core physical infrastructure had a 0.24 percent increase in productivity. At the same time public investment in infrastructure spurs private investment; Pereira (2001) estimates that a public investment of $1 into electric and gas facilities transit systems and airfields leads to a $2.38 increase in long-term private investment.

Many of the economic gains of infrastructure are concentrated at the bottom of the income distribution meaning that infrastructure investment can help promote equity. By one estimate a 1 standard deviation (7 percentage point) increase in the growth rate of public investment in highways over a decade would erase almost two-thirds of the increase in income inequality observed between 2000 and 2010. Another study concludes that increasing infrastructure spending from 2 percent to 5 percent of GDP increases the wealth share of the bottom quintile from 3.95 percent to 4.49 percent.

Infrastructure investment is critical for climate resilience adaptation and the facilitation of green technologies

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal confronts the reality that the United States needs infrastructure that mitigates and adapts to the immense projected damages of climate change. This requires helping U.S. communities increase their resilience to climate change while also facilitating a move to net zero carbon emissions. After all infrastructure is necessary to support the growth of clean energy technologies and therefore to the success of the broader Build Back Better agenda.[1]

Hurricane Ida a category 4 storm that hit New Orleans in August of 2021 provides a striking example of the importance of resilience and the ongoing need for continued investment. Despite the severity of Ida flooding was actually limited due to a new storm protection system installed by the Federal government in the wake of Hurricane Katrina which caused a humanitarian catastrophe—and over $100 billion in damages—when the city’s levees failed. Importantly however shortcomings in the city’s electricity grid meant that millions lost power and hundreds of thousands remained without it for days leading to at least nine deaths caused by excessive heat during the power outage and producing repair costs estimated at over $2 billion.

The power outages in the wake of Ida as well as the Texas freeze in early 2021 that left roughly 10 million Texans without electricity and cost an estimated $155 billion nationwide highlight the need to modernize the nation’s electric grid. One Department of Energy study finds that power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $150 billion annually. Without careful planning these costs to the electricity grid will grow due to the increased frequency and severity of extreme events caused by climate change. Investments in electricity transmission can unleash the full potential of renewable energy by enabling more power to be delivered to urban centers from the windiest and sunniest parts of the country and in turn save households money and make the economy more resilient. One estimate finds that investments in the eastern U.S. transmission grid could reduce energy bills by at least 33 percent.

Reforming the transportation sector is also critical to addressing climate change. In 2019 29 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions came from transportation. In order to meet President Biden’s climate goals and mitigate damages in the coming decades the United States will need to move away from fossil fuel-powered vehicles and towards public transit and rail and electric vehicles (EVs).

While EVs are increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel-powered cars their market shares remain in single digits. For those interested in purchasing electric vehicles a major barrier is the relatively limited availability of charging stations. Strategic investment can greatly increase the share of people whose car needs can be fulfilled with electric vehicles. Consider Norway where the Federal government has committed to supporting EVs; last month over three-quarters of total car sales were electric.

Promoting access to public transit can also support the transition to a net zero carbon economy. One estimate from the Department of Transportation (DOT) finds that U.S. bus transit emits an estimated 33 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile than the average U.S. personal vehicle. The same DOT study finds investments in hybrid electric buses would further decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

Reducing emissions not only addresses climate change but also supports health and well-being in ways that will improve productivity now and far into the future. School buses for example make up 80 percent of all buses in the United States and the majority run on diesel which emits exhaust fumes that are detrimental to human health and can cause asthma. Electrifying the entire U.S. school bus fleet would not only reduce overall bus emissions by 35 percent per year but in doing so improve the current well-being and future productivity of American students who would inhale cleaner air on their ride to school. Austin et al. (2019) estimate that retrofitting an entire school district’s fleet of diesel buses to reduce emissions by 60 to 90 percent can increase English test scores by 0.14 standard deviation when all students ride the bus.

Why now?

Infrastructure reform is long overdue. We are not only living with broken 20th century roads and bridges but are missing out on the advances of 21st century such as state-of-the-art automation and fast broadband. Failing to make these investments hurts the competitiveness of American businesses and the economic security of American families. Now is also the time to invest in infrastructure that supports the move to net zero carbon emissions. By one estimate every decade of delayed action on climate change doubles the cost of decarbonization.

Already the United States is paying a high price for delaying action to stand up the infrastructure necessary to address climate change. The last seven years have been the warmest on record and 2020 was tied for the warmest single year on record. Economic damages from climate change come in multiple forms including more intense hurricanes that cost billions of dollars in damages every year drier and hotter conditions that make forest fires more likely and warmer weather that reduces crop yields. In 2020 major extreme weather and climate events cost the United States $100 billion. This summer nearly one in three Americans lived in a county hit by a weather disaster. Americans pay for the costs of extreme weather directly by for example fixing flooded basements but also indirectly by facing mounting insurance costs.

Climate action also provides other benefits including for health. Heat exposure alone is estimated to cause 12000 premature deaths annually in the continental United States 37 percent of which (between 1991 and 2018) were attributed to anthropogenic climate change. By the end of the century deaths from heat exposure are expected to increase by 36000 per year in a moderate emissions scenario and 97000 per year in a high emissions scenario. And local air pollution produced by fossil fuel combustion causes premature death exacerbates existing health conditions (especially among lower-income groups and communities of color)—which can lead to higher infant mortality —and reduces worker productivity

Reducing the risks of climate change has important equity implications. Because climate change tends to hit low income regions and individuals harder it widens existing economic inequality. In one study estimating the economic damage of climate change in the United States the poorest decile of counties is projected to suffer median losses that are 9.5 times larger than the richest decile of counties when losses are measured as a percentage of baseline income.

Now is also the time to make these investments from a financing perspective. The costs of borrowing remain at historic lows. Real interest rates—the yield on U.S. Treasury securities less observed inflation—are the price the government pays to borrow money from the private sector which includes both households and firms. For the first time since 2013 real 10-year interest rates on U.S. treasury securities have remained below zero for over a full year. Considering that new government debt would go towards increasing long-term growth the downsides of increasing the debt are small in comparison to the benefits of this much needed infrastructure. As the 2022 Federal Budget lays out the burden associated with the debt is the level of interest payments; given low interest rates additional capital investments would be affordable. Low rates are also a signal of the market’s confidence that the U.S. government will continue to pay its debts on time.

Though under some circumstances deficit-financed funding can decrease long-term output by crowding out private investment the current availability of funds for private actors signals that crowd-out is unlikely. Low rates indicate that there is sufficient supply of capital to meet demand and that businesses are not struggling to find funding. In fact corporate profits are at an all-time high (up 37 percent since the fourth quarter of 2019) another indication that debt-servicing costs are not prohibitive. All of this suggests that markets are willing to lend funds to the government so that it can make economically important investments.

Conclusion

Investments in America’s infrastructure have the potential to boost long-run productivity and deliver broad-based economic growth that reaches communities across America. Importantly these investments also can advance climate resilience and reduce inflationary pressures. The country cannot continue to thrive in the 21st century with ailing 20th century infrastructure. The time is now to make these investments.

Officials at Westchester Plastics and Fluoropolymer Products recently announced that Ametek Inc. has sold the Nesquehoning facility to Niche Polymer. The sale was finalized on Sept. 7.

Sunny Naik vice president of operations for Niche Polymer said that Ametek approached Niche about the opportunity to take over the Nesquehoning facility late last year after the Maryland-based company showed interest in Ametek’s Ohio plastics facility that closed.

That acquisition fell through but the companies’ relationship did not.

“We were approached as an off-market opportunity because we have an existing relationship and they have known about our presence in the plastic industry” he said.

“They came to us with a goal to not only maintain and continue the business after the purchase but with a strategic growth and projections on how to continue to provide services to the customers.”

Niche has been in the polymer industry for over 35 years started by Naik’s father Dr. Saurabh Naik and currently has 17 facilities throughout the country. Its services align with the operations already being done here in the Panther Valley.

“We put a lot of time and dedication into making this investment in this plant” Sunny Naik said.

“Plastic is what we have done since Day One. … I really think we have the ability technically and business-wise to really focus customers and give this plant what it needs to grow - from infrastructure from customer base from mechanical improvements - and that’s what we plan to do here.

“It’s important to reiterate that we’re plastics people. It’s what we do … and we’re really really excited for the growth. This is a plant we really wanted to buy and we hope to make this a really long-term option.”

Mark Rother director of sales and marketing for Westchester Plastics echoed Naik’s thoughts saying that it was exciting to have a company come in that knows plastics already.

Westchester Plastics is a toll compounder that specializes in creating formulated plastic pellets that are used by companies across the world to create everything from vehicle dashboards and carpeting to composite materials.

On the fluoropolymer side that company specializes in heat exchangers and uses a specialized method using its plastics knowledge to create their products.

“We have a number of customers that we already shared with Niche so we are going to be able to grow this business in this area of the plant” Rother said.

“It’s exciting to be able to sit down and talk about growth instead of just trying to sustain.”

Rother commended Niche for its efforts in finding ways to not only work with plastic but also create programs at their facilities to recycle plastic that has been used and put it back into the stream of reuse rather than the product going into landfills.

“These guys have been on the forefront and taking as much of the post industrial and consumer waste that they can get their hands on and recycling back through to the point where we are now seeing a lot of the big resin producers are all interested in it. We want to be in the forefront of this. We are positioning ourselves based on what they’ve done for the last 20 years.”

Both Naik and Rother said that what is needed next for the new facility is employment growth.

“We have enough business for seven or eight lines that we can run 24 hours a day five days a week but we got enough people to maybe run only three” Rother said adding that Ametek has been a great owner of the facility over the years.

Naik said that it is important to provide sustainable jobs to areas such as Nesquehoning and hopes that over the next few months the news of the acquisition will help bring more employees.

To apply for a position at Westchester Plastics visit the Nesquehoning facility at 42 Mountain Ave. or call the plant at 570-645-6900.

It might just mean robots take their jobs instead.Labor shortages and rising wages are pushing U.S. business to invest in automation. A recent Federal Reserve survey of chief financial officers found that at firms with difficulty hiring one-third are implementing or exploring automation to replace workers. In earnings calls over the past month executives from a range of businesses confirmed the trend.Domino’s Pizza Inc. is “putting in place equipment and technology that reduce the amount of labor that is required to produce our dough balls” said Chief Executive Officer Ritch Allison.Mark Coffey a group vice president at Hormel Foods Corp. said the maker of Spam spread and Skippy peanut butter is “ramping up our investments in automation” because of the “tight labor supply.”The mechanizing of mundane tasks has been underway for generations. It’s made remarkable progress in the past decade: The number of industrial robots installed in the world’s factories more than doubled in that time to about 3 million. Automation has been spreading into service businesses too.The U.S. has lagged behind other economies especially Asian ones but the pandemic might trigger some catching up. With some 10.4 million open positions as of August and record numbers of Americans quitting their jobs the difficulty of finding staff is adding new incentives.Ametek Inc. makes automation equipment for industrial firms like motion trackers that are used from steel and lumber mills to packaging systems. Chief Executive Officer David A. Zapico says that part of the company is “firing on all cylinders.” That’s because “people want to remove labor from the processes” he said on an earnings call. “In some places you can’t hire labor.”Unions have long seen automation as a threat. At U.S. ports which lag their global peers in technology and are currently at the center of a major supply-chain crisis the International Longshoremen’s Association has vowed to fight it.Companies that say they want to automate “have one goal in mind: to eliminate your job and put more money in their pockets” ILA President Harold Daggett said in a video message to a June conference. “We’re going to fight this for 100 years.”Some economists have warned that automation could make America ’s income and wealth gaps worse.“If it continues labor demand will grow slowly inequality will increase and the prospects for many low-education workers will not be very good” says Daron Acemoglu a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who testified Wednesday at a Senate hearing on the issue.That’s not an inevitable outcome Acemoglu says: Scientific knowhow could be used “to develop technologies that are more complementary to workers.” But with research largely dominated by a handful of giant firms that spend the most money on it “this is not the direction the technology is going currently.”Knightscope makes security robots that look a bit like R2-D2 from Star Wars and can patrol sites such as factory perimeters. The company says it’s attracting new clients who are having trouble hiring workers to keep watch. Its robots cost from $3.50 to $7.50 an hour according to Chief Client Officer Stacy Stephens and can be installed a month after signing a contract.One new customer is the Los Angeles International Airport one of the busiest in the U.S. Soon Knightscope robots will be monitoring some of its parking lots.They are “supplementing what we have in place and are not replacing any human services” said Heath Montgomery the airport’s director of public relations. “It’s another way we are providing exceptional guest experiences.”,,,,,,,,,

All are present in products enjoying their debut at Capital Audiofest 2021.

Based in Southport Connecticut Treehaus Audiolab showed three new products: an open-baffle loudspeaker called the Phantom of Luxury ($24000/pair) the Treehaus Audiolab preamplifier ($16000) and the Treehaus Audiolab power amplifier ($16000).

To play records Pinto used a Micro Seiki BL-91 turntable with a Hana ML cart on a Fidelity Research FR-64S tonearm. The phono cartridge's output was stepped up by a prototype step-up transformer; from there it went to a heavily modified Ear 834P phono stage.

Qobuz streamed via a MacBook Air to a Schiit Eitr USB-to-S/PDIF converter into a Concert Fidelity 040Mk2 DAC. Belden digital Blue Jeans LC-1 interconnects and Canare 4S11 Star Quad speaker cables completed the setup.

The Treehaus Audiolab preamplifier uses a separate power supply a Finemet Transformer–based Volume Control a 4P1L amplification circuit using Coleman filament regulators Finemet output transformers Cardas RCA input and output jacks Elma input switching Amphenol connectors on the PS umbilical cord and a hardwood veneer case over a Baltic Birch multi-ply core. The preamp’s dark toned outer shell corroded aluminum faceplate copper mesh vents and brass control knobs recall industrial and mid-century design esthetics.

The Treehaus Audiolab power amplifier is a collaboration with electronics designer and builder Radu Tarta and is based on the work of the late legendary Susuma Sakuma. It’s rated at 6.5Wpc running NOS 10Y/801A driver tubes and Gold Lion 300B power tubes with a separate power supply based on Sakuma architecture. It employs Finemet interstage and output iron transformers Coleman filament regulators Cardas RCA input and output jacks and like the preamplifier a hardwood veneer case over a Baltic Birch multi-ply core.

The 30"" wide 52"" tall organically shaped Phantom of Luxury open-baffle loudspeakers are made of Walnut or Elm with Maple side walls and legs. The driver complement is a Fostex T900A Super Tweeter 8 1/2"" Oleg Rullit “Super Aero” full-range field-coil driver with tube rectified power supply and a 12"" Supravox field coil woofer and power supply. The sensitivity specification is 102dB into 8 ohms.

The sound of this system put me in mind of Art Dudley and Herb Reichert both of whom would have been tempted to close the door and call it a day listening to the wee hours but instead would have kept working the show. Tone was deep and the sound was tactile with textures you could almost touch. The bass was soft but the sweetness of the system’s sound was special and moving.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven in 10 Americans have at least one analog clock in their home but fewer than half have two and just one in five have three or more clocks in their home.

Still analog clocks may be going out of style with younger adults. Nearly half of those under 35 don't have one and a third of Americans between 35 and 44 also don't have an analog clock in their home either.

Nevertheless most Americans think children should still know how to read them. Three in four think children should still be taught in school how to tell time with an analog clock — including most Americans who don't have an analog clock in their home themselves. A quarter think their time would be better spent learning other things.

This poll was conducted by telephone October 12-17 2021 among a random sample of 1010 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.

The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.

Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

Berkshire spent nearly $20 billion more repurchasing its own stock since the middle of 2018 than it deployed accumulating its Apple stake through the end of last year. In total Buffett poured about $51 billion into buybacks since a change to its policy more than three years ago and appears to have continued snapping up at least $1.7 billion of stock since the end of September.

Buffett Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer has built Berkshire into a sprawling conglomerate valued at more than $650 billion but that immense size has heaped pressure on his need for what he deemed an “elephant-sized"" acquisition to ramp up Berkshire’s growth. Buffett has been foiled on his recent deal hunt outbid at times by aggressive private equity firms. That’s left him increasingly relying on buybacks with more than $20 billion of repurchases so far this year as a way to put some of Berkshire’s record cash pile to work.

“The bull case would say they bought back $20 billion worth of their stock because they’re confident in their future outlook and that should be a catalyst for the stock and my sense is it probably will"" Cathy Seifert an analyst at CFRA Research said. “The bear case which is also relevant to point out is this is a company that has had as a stated desire the need to make additional acquisitions and they haven’t been able to do that.""

It’s a marked shift for a CEO who previously shunned buybacks. For years Buffett preferred large deals and spending money snapping up other company’s stocks over repurchasing Berkshire’s own shares. But that changed in 2018 when the company’s board lifted a cap on buybacks giving Buffett and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger more flexibility to parcel out profits.

Buybacks have now surpassed even Berkshire’s largest holding an Apple Inc. stake valued at more than $121 billion at the end of September. The company has spent just $31 billion buying Apple shares since it began accumulating that stake in 2016 through the end of 2020 according to the most recent data available.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

“We believe Warren Buffett’s significant share repurchases show his conservatism as rising valuations make deals he may find attractive more scarce.""

-- Matthew Palazola and Kylie Towbin BI analysts

All the buyback activity while significant in size hasn’t been enough to meaningfully whittle away some of the conglomerate’s cash. Berkshire ended September with a record $149.2 billion of funds in its coffers. While investors often want management to remain disciplined on when and how it spends the money the swelling cash pile is “somewhat disappointing"" according to Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.

“Buybacks were fine but cash balances increased again"" Shanahan said. “Cash is now approaching $150 billion. That certainly was unexpected earlier this calendar year I would have thought they would have been able to manage that lower with a combination of investments acquisitions and buybacks.""

The Omaha Nebraska-based business which reported third-quarter earnings Saturday posted an 18% gain in operating profit during that period buoyed by record railroad earnings and strong results from its energy businesses. That helped offset even more underwriting losses at its group of insurers which have been hit by catastrophes such as Hurricane Ida and more frequent claims from its drivers at auto insurer Geico.

Berkshire also disclosed that it bought back at least $1.7 billion in stock from the end of September through October 27 according to Saturday’s filing. Empire Financial Research’s Whitney Tilson who’s attended the Berkshire annual meeting for more than two decades applauded the buyback but noted that he’d still prefer to see Buffett find the next lucrative stock bet.

“If Buffett could find another Apple clearly I’d rather have him allocate to that"" Tilson said. “Buying back Berkshire stock makes sense when you’re drowning in cash.""

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Nouveau record historique pour Novak Djokovic : en se qualifiant samedi 6 novembre pour la finale du Masters 1000 de Paris aux dépens d'Hubert Hurkacz le Serbe s'est assuré de terminer l'année numéro 1 mondial pour la septième fois soit une de plus que Pete Sampras.

Depuis ses débuts professionnels en 2003 Djokovic 34 ans a terminé au sommet de la hiérarchie mondiale en 2011 2012 2014 2015 2018 2020 et donc 2021.

Cette saison il a notamment remporté les trois premiers Majeurs (Open d'Australie Roland-Garros Wimbledon) et a joué la finale de l'US Open pour tenter de réussir un rarissime Grand Chelem.

Un de ses grands objectifs

Il en a été empêché par Daniil Medvedev (2e mondial) qui jusqu'à samedi pouvait encore également le priver du record du nombre d'années finies en tant que numéro 1.

Djokovic ne s'en cachait pas ce record était l'un de ses grands objectifs comme le record de titres en Grand Chelem qu'il partage avec Roger Federer et Rafael Nadal (20). Ses deux grands rivaux ont terminé cinq saisons sur le trône mondial : 2004 2005 2006 2007 et 2009 pour le Suisse 2008 2010 2013 2017 et 2019 pour l'Espagnol.

""C'est la principale raison pour laquelle je suis là"" avait convenu ""Nole"" vendredi après sa qualification pour les demies.

Pour y parvenir il a battu samedi Hurkacz (10e) 4-6 6-0 7-6 (7/5).

Dimanche 7 novembre à l'issue de sa 54e finale de Masters 1000 (record) il aura l'occasion de s'adjuger seul un nouveau record avec un 37e titre dans cette catégorie de tournois juste en-dessous des Majeurs soit un de plus que Nadal.

Il devra pour cela battre le Russe Daniil Medvedev.

Le résumé de la semaineFrance 24 vous propose de revenir sur les actualités qui ont marqué la semaine Je m'abonne",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYWRlcGVjaGUuZnIvMjAyMS8xMS8wNi90ZW5uaXMtdG91cm5vaS1kZS1wYXJpcy1iZXJjeS1ub3Zhay1kam9rb3ZpYy1zZW1wYXJlLWR1bi1ub3V2ZWF1LXJlY29yZC1ldC1lZmZhY2UtcGV0ZS1zYW1wcmFzLTk5MTI4NzYucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tennis - tournoi de Paris-Bercy : Novak Djokovic s'empare d'un nouveau record et efface Pete Sampras,"l'essentiel Après sa victoire ce samedi 6 novembre en demi-finale du Masters 1000 parisien le Serbe est assuré de finir l'année en position numéro 1 du tennis mondial. Une nouvelle fois.

Freiné dans sa chasse aux records cet été Novak Djokovic n'a pas tardé à reprendre sa marche en avant: qualifié pour la finale du Masters 1000 de Paris samedi il s'est emparé d'un record de plus en s'assurant de terminer la saison N.1 mondial pour la septième fois.

Djokovic a comblé un set de retard pour renverser le Polonais Hubert Hurkacz (10e) 3-6 6-0 7-6 (7/5) en 2h17 min. En finale il affrontera soit le N.2 mondial Daniil Medvedev soit le N.4 Alexander Zverev opposés dans la foulée dans un remake de la finale 2020 qui avait eu lieu à huis clos en raison du Covid-19.

Lancé vers un exceptionnel Grand Chelem calendaire et encore plus rarissime Grand Chelem doré à l'amorce des Jeux olympiques de Tokyo après avoir mis la main sur les trois premiers Grand Chelem millésime 2021 (Open d'Australie Roland-Garros et Wimbledon) Djokovic a vécu un été de désillusions.

À Tokyo d'abord quitté sans monter sur le podium olympique après deux revers d'affilée en demi-finale (contre Zverev) puis dans le match pour la médaille de bronze (contre Carreño).

Puis à New York mi-septembre où il a craqué en finale de l'US Open dans le match sans doute le plus important de sa carrière terminé dans les larmes.

Le champion serbe n'a toutefois pas mis longtemps à reprendre ses esprits.

Dès son tournoi de reprise après quasiment deux mois hors-circuit le voilà en finale dans la salle de Bercy et surtout désormais seul propriétaire d'un autre record de l'histoire du tennis: celui du nombre de saisons terminées sur le trône de N.1 mondial.

Djokovic 7 Federer et Nadal 5

""Djoko"" le partageait jusque-là avec Pete Sampras qui y est parvenu six années d'affilée entre 1993 et 1998. Roger Federer comme Rafael Nadal l'ont eux réalisé cinq fois.

Sa qualification pour la finale parisienne lui permet de le réussir une septième fois après 2011 2012 2014 2015 2018 et 2020.

Logique et mérité au vu de sa brillante saison 2021 au cours de laquelle il a rejoint ses deux principaux rivaux Federer et Nadal au nombre de titres en Grand Chelem avec vingt trophées et dépassé le premier au nombre de semaines passées à la place de N.1 mondial (il en est à 345 contre 310 pour Federer).

Une saison au cours de laquelle il est aussi devenu le premier joueur de l'ère Open (et le troisième de l'histoire) à remporter au moins deux fois chaque tournoi majeur.

Hurkacz assuré depuis la veille de sa toute première qualification pour le Masters de fin de saison (14-21 novembre à Turin) et vainqueur en avril de son premier Masters 1000 à Miami lui a néanmoins donné du fil à retordre samedi.

Le grand Polonais (196 m) a su breaker au meilleur moment dans le premier set pour mener 5 jeux à 3 et virer en tête dans la foulée.

Puis distancé 4 jeux à 1 dans la troisième manche il est revenu à hauteur à 4-4 jusqu'à pousser Djokovic dans un tie-break décisif non sans avoir écarté une balle de match à 5-4.

Entre les deux Hurkacz coupable d'une quarantaine de fautes directes au total (contre 26 à Djokovic) n'avait pas inscrit le moindre jeu pendant près de trois quarts d'heure encaissant au passage un cinglant 6-0 dans le deuxième set.

Voilà ainsi Djokovic en finale d'un Masters 1000 pour la 54e fois de sa carrière et plus qu'à un succès d'un 37e trophée dans cette catégorie de tournois la deuxième plus importante après les Grand Chelem. Il s'agirait là aussi d'un nouveau record.

Une maladie qu'elle avait cachée à tout le monde pendant plusieurs mois : ""Une femme sans cheveux c'est encore plus mal vu qu'un cancer"" écrit notamment l'actrice qui a subi une chimiothérapie pour expliquer son silence ajoutant : ""C'est fou l'impression que ça fait. C'est morbide ça sent la fin de vie quoi."" Mais dans son ouvrage Clémentine Célarié ne parle pas que de sa chimiothérapie de la perte de ses cheveux de ses efforts pour cacher son état de santé aux gens du métier en particulier. Elle parle de son parcours de sa carrière. Et notamment d'une décision qui a changé sa vie : subir une rhinoplastie.

Clémentine Célarié : ""J'ai inconsciemment changé mon destin""

Clémentine Célarié était adolescente qu'elle a cédé à l'appel de la chirurgie esthétique.

Je me suis payé une normalité mais elle n'était qu'extérieure."" Il faut dire que Clémentine Célarié était complexée par son apparence.

Cette fois les «Ressortissants de la communauté fang du Gabon» sont montés au créneau le 6 novembre pour «s’indigner fortement de ces termes vexatoires et séparatistes au plus haut point».

Assurant avoir consulté les notables les leaders d’opinion syndicaux et sociaux fang avant de s’exprimer à la suite des déclarations «fâcheuses» du président du Rassemblement des Gaulois Max Anicet Koumba contre les Fang un Collectif présenté sous l’appellation de «Ressortissants de la communauté fang du Gabon» s’est exprimé le 6 novembre à Libreville. Le porte-parole du Collectif le président du Front patriotique gabonais (FPG) Gérard Ella Nguéma a rappelé d’emblée que «le Gabon demeure un et indivisible comme lui confère d’ailleurs la Constitution en son article 2 du Titre premier intitulé «de la République et de la Souveraineté»».

Les «Ressortissants de la communauté fang du Gabon» estiment que les propos de ce leader ont de «relents sécessionnistes». Par ailleurs «si tant est que les Fang du Gabon constituent le blocage du développement du pays nous indiquons que les Fang du Gabon ne sont ni anarchistes ni monarchistes». «La communauté fang du Gabon est par contre sertie des jacobins en quête permanente du progrès social. Et les Fang pris dans leur globalité sont des bâtisseurs par excellence» a déclaré Gérard Ella Nguema.

Ce dernier a affirmé qu’il peut «dire haut et fort que le malaise du Gabon ne peut avoir comme seuls responsables les Fang malgré la stigmatisation subie depuis belle lurette» tout en dénonçant la théorie de «Badjague» consistant selon lui à «freiner la propension des Fang à l’enseignement à l’éducation à la formation et au savoir» avec le «Tout sauf les Fang (TSF)». Un «projet politique de faire sans les Fang» et qui peut se transformer en «Tuez-les tous».

Tout en récusant la phrase choc de max Anicet selon laquelle «l’imposture l’incivisme et l’indiscipline des fang sont responsables du blocage du Gabon» le porte-parole de la communauté fang rappelle que celle-ci ne saurait être «quantité négligeable» d’autant plus qu’elle représente entre 49% et 52% de la population gabonaise et ses membres sont répartis sur cinq des neuf provinces.

Bannir la cristallisation identitaire aux conséquences imprévisibles

Au regard de l’amplification de la «stigmatisation des Fang» leur porte-parole se demande si l’acte de Max Anicet Koumba n’est pas «les prémices d’un éventuel génocide» en s’appuyant sur les cas allemand et rwandais. «Les faits étant têtus et au regard de la démonstration qui précède la communauté fang du Gabon s’interroge si finalement c’est cette voie vers laquelle l’on est en train de la conduire ?».

Quoi qu’il arrive a-t-il indiqué la communauté fang restera «viscéralement attachée» à la cohésion nationale à l’unité nationale et à un meilleur vivre-ensemble chers aux pères fondateurs de la Nation gabonaise ; tout en regrettant que ce Gabon soit devenu «un pays affaibli par un repli identitaire affirmé où l’ethnisme apparait comme un prétexte pour certains acteurs politiques avides de pouvoir».

Les Ressortissants de la communauté fang du Gabon ont invité le président Ali Bongo à envisager «de nouvelles hypothèses susceptibles d’empêcher la cristallisation des options identitaires aux conséquences imprévisibles».

Le 28 octobre au Conseil national de la démocratie Max Anicet Koumba avait déclaré que «les dysfonctionnements constatés dans la conduite des affaires du Gabon sont causés par l’incivisme et l’indiscipline d’un petit nombre de nos compatriotes. Je tiens à dire ici je l’affirme et je le répète le Gabon est bloqué par l’imposture des Pahouins et le tribalisme…». Il indexait pour ainsi dire la communauté fang."

Cristian Bencomo was booked into jail on Wednesday May 8 accused of shooting his stepmother the Albuquerque Police Department said in a post on X formerly known as Twitter.

Officers responded to the Albuquerque Convention Center shortly after 5 p.m. on Wednesday for reports of gunfire Gilbert Gallegos the department’s communications director said in a video posted on X formerly Twitter.

Officers initially thought they were responding to an active shooter situation but later learned a single gunshot was fired Gallegos said.

The investigation revealed that Bencomo’s stepmother “started to hug him” and he pulled out a “handgun and shot her in the neck” police said.

“We made it all the way through graduation – it was really lovely until it wasn’t” Mary Ward a witness told KOB 4 Eyewitness News.

Ward told the news outlet that the students were told to give a rose to someone in the audience.

“I was watching my student she was coming to the right of me then I looked to the left to the other side there was a crowd of people and then there was a big pop” Ward said the outlet reported.

With more than 100 people in attendance at the charter school graduation Gallegos said “there was a lot of … chaos at the time.”

Nonetheless police said “bystanders held (Bencomo) until officers arrived.”

The woman was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries according to Gallegos. She underwent “hours of surgery” according to the organizers of a GoFundMe who said she will need continued medical treatment and rehab.

Angel Chester the woman’s sister was close by when the shooting happened KRQE News reported. Chester told the station she witnessed Bencomo stomp on her sister’s head following the shooting.

“I keep thinking that it’s a bad dream that I’ll wake up from” Chester told the outlet.

Bencomo is facing multiple counts including aggravated assault and aggravated battery online jail records show. He is being held without bail.

Police are still investigating the shooting according KOAT-TV.

“I suspect that there was a lot of maybe photos or video or witnesses so anyone who doesn’t talk to detectives here on scene is urged to call APD 242-COPS. 505-242-COPS” Gallegos told the outlet.

Beginning on May 31 Season 1 of the animated sci-fi drama will begin streaming on Netflix in the U.S. the U.K. Ireland and New Zealand. The Netflix deal is non-exclusive meaning the episodes will remain available on Max. Sources tell Variety that Netflix is considering picking up “Scavengers Reign” for a second season but a decision won’t be made until after Season 1’s debut on the streamer.

The series is set on an alien planet where a damaged interstellar freighter ship gets stranded and follows the remaining crew as they struggle to locate their ship and missing crewmates while navigating a hostile world that has thrived without human interference.

Variety named “Scavengers Reign” one of the top 19 shows of 2023 with critic Alison Herman writing that it “pairs the engrossing ambience of a nature documentary with the propulsive thrust of narrative. Its characters are fully realized and flawed but their main scene partners are an environment they need to intuit the workings of alongside the audience. The 12-episode season is a deep cut worth seeking out (or renewing if you’re the powers that be and Warner Bros. Discovery).”

Popular on Variety

“Scavengers Reign” was created Joseph Bennett and Charles Huettner who executive produce alongside Chris Prynoski. Sean Buckelew and James Merrill serve as co-executive producers with Benjy Brooke as supervising director. The series was produced by Green Street Pictures in partnership with Titmouse Inc.

“We are beyond thrilled that ‘Scavengers Reign’ will be joining the incredible animation lineup on Netflix” said Bennett Buckelew Merrill and Brooke on behalf of Green Street. “We’re immensely grateful to everyone who has watched the show already and to Netflix for giving it an opportunity to be discovered by a wider audience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTY4OTcyODU10gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNjg5NzI4NTUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Test-at-home kit for cancer patients approved for use,

With over 150 years of experience in the coatings industry they provide their customers with innovative colourful and sustainable solutions.

Predominantly developing and manufacturing coatings for light and commercial vehicles industrial and refinish applications; Axalta embraces the latest trends alongside emerging technology and systems to deliver the finest coatings to more than 100000 customers across the globe. With 46 manufacturing centres across the world 28 laboratories and a presence in over 130 countries the team at Axalta are constantly looking at news ways to push boundaries.

Marco Schuh BIM Manager at Axalta has worked in the architecture engineering and construction industry for the last 20 years. In his various roles Marco has witnessed the vast expansion of computer-aided design first-hand and has seen Business Information Modelling (BIM) use and demand rapidly increase. “For the last five years I have been focusing on cloud-based project management practices in a BIM environment so I have seen the application and the technology grow too” says Marco.

In 2019 Axalta’s plant engineering subsidiary business based in Wuppertal Germany began exploring how they could move some of their local project data from a local server into the cloud. The team wanted to be able to host and store project documentation centrally in a secure environment but also to learn more about how they could improve implement and embed digital workflows for this business unit to aid communication and collaboration.

Standardising ways of working

With many different document management practices happening on the ground for the plant engineering team ensuring standardised document management processes were implemented smoothly was very important. Alongside this the team also needed to find a solution that allowed everyone to access the documents they needed wherever and whenever they needed them.

Working in a plant environment with tight timescales means that the team at Axalta cannot afford to lose project time due to poor communication because of missing project data. The team were already using a server solution for internal documentation but it limited their ability to successfully access track and collaborate on documents in a transparent way.

After a period of exploration Axalta concluded that Autodesk Construction Cloud’s BIM 360 solution was the right technology for Axalta’s needs with a focus on improving communication. To implement the solution successfully and smoothly Marco partnered with Autodesk’s customer success team and their local reseller partner Mensch und Maschine Deutschland. It was crucial that the team at Axalta were able to move their interdisciplinary project data into the cloud environment in a seamless way minimising any disruption to ongoing live projects.

“Our projects are time-critical so we need smooth transparent clear communication and filing to know where project data was stored as we transitioned from our previous system to BIM 360” Marco reflects.

Creating a comprehensive transition plan

The team at Axalta were aware of the long-term negative impacts that could arise from disruption to ongoing projects so they created a comprehensive transition plan. The plan which spanned a 12-month period involved an elaborated transition process which included a testing and a migration phase. This happened in parallel with Axalta’s ongoing day-to-day regular processes so the team were managing two ways of working at once. Working in this way helped to minimise any interruptions or delays to ongoing work and allowed the team plenty of time to understand and prepare employees for new ways of working within the team.

To get started the team at Axalta began their journey with BIM 360 on a large collaborative project which involved several stakeholders – many of which were not directly located on site at Axalta’s plant facility. To ensure all the external collaborators and partners were safely and comprehensively introduced to the solution and the new ways of working Marco conducted introductory sessions on site. As well as this Marco and the team created an internal handbook for project team members to use with a complete overview of the BIM 360 project workflows that would be rolled out.

“We worked closely with the team at Autodesk to ensure we transitioned successfully and this included bi-monthly calls with tech champions mentorship on workflows for these champions feedback sessions with Autodesk’s product team as well as ongoing communication on outcome-focused goals” says Marco.

Internal plant maintenance projects and construction projects for new plants began using BIM 360 for document management and digital workflows. The team began with a focus on document management practices but soon expanded into using other capabilities BIM 360 had to offer. Naming conventions and folder structures were the first areas the team focused on as well as supporting the Computer Aided Design (CAD) teams with how they could digitalise and integrate their processes with BIM 360. This involved training sessions and one-to-one support by Marco as a BIM 360 expert.

“We began exploring the functionality that allowed our teams to make notes and annotations onto our models in BIM 360 which increased accountability transparency and communication immensely” says Marco. “Annotating directly on the model meant that we minimised the chance of anything being missed when moving between different platforms and systems.” The team have also looked at what other digital workflows they could expand to use such as issues tracking.

For the team at Axalta using BIM 360 as their common data environment meant internal communication on projects improved significantly. Marco says: “BIM 360 gives us a single source of truth transparency between all project stakeholders and accessibility from anywhere meaning we’re all much better informed during a live project than we were before we started using BIM 360.” For the team quality has increased dramatically as all project team members can be sure they are accessing one single source of truth. As well as this standardising the team’s approach to document control and modelling has meant that all project collaborators can be sure they have the most up-to-date and accurate information they need when making important project decisions related to their tasks and activities.

Scaling for success

After a year of testing and using BIM 360 in the plant engineering subsidiary business the use of BIM 360 is being explored by some of Axalta’s manufacturing construction and engineering departments in their locations in Germany.

“Looking to the future we plan on expanding our use of BIM 360 in plant and engineering even more” affirms Marco. “We’ve also began integrating further technology into BIM 360 such as our laser scanning workflows and we’re looking to use the BIM 360 Coordinate feature to improve our model coordination processes” remarks Marco.

For the team at Axalta implementing BIM 360 to create robust document management processes digitalising workflows and capturing project progress information in a BIM environment has not only improved team collaboration but delivered better project outcomes. “The most popular features in BIM 360 that our teams are using are the project management model coordination and issues management workflows as well as the powerful approval workflows for reviews within document management capabilities which reflects how the quality of our projects are improving through the use of BIM 360” says Marco. Looking to the future implementing the use of BIM 360 on more and more projects is the focus for the team as well as harnessing data for better project insights to drive decision-making across the business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYWxsM2RwLmNvbS8yL2Jlc3QtZnVzaW9uLTM2MC1vbmxpbmUtY291cnNlcy1jbGFzc2VzLXRyYWluaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Fusion 360 Online Courses & Trainings,This article is free for you and free from outside influence.

It became a necessity for businesses – particularly those in the transportation and warehouse industry – to utilize automation technologies to ensure employee safety.

With the warehouse automation market expected to be worth $30 billion by 2026 it appears that automation is here to stay. Now the question is not whether you should or shouldn’t implement automation but rather how can you maximize the functionality of your automation efforts.

What Is Logistics Automation?

Broadly speaking logistics automation is the process of utilizing software or automated machinery to streamline warehouse operations. It reduces the time spent doing repetitive tasks such as manual location sourcing data entry multichannel inventory management and more.

The ability to implement both digital and physical automation processes provides logistics companies with a greater deal of flexibility scalability and possibility.

From streamlining a freelance business to managing a fulfillment center automation is proving to be a successful investment for businesses across multiple industries. When it comes to logistics automation the benefits are potentially some of the most significant.

What Are the Benefits of Logistics Automation?

Before we explore how to maximize your logistics automation functionality here are just a few of the benefits that proper implementation can provide.

Reduces Costly Errors

When it comes to inventory control and freight travel human error can result in significant losses. Logistics automation can be integrated with your Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and given access to your address book automatic storage and fuel surcharges. This reduces the risk of an employee manually entering the wrong data consequently resulting in fewer incurring fees.

Reduces Labor Intensity

While labor will always be an important part of your warehouse operations overwhelming labor intensity can tire out employees and lead to costly – and potentially even dangerous – human errors. By implementing automation you can simplify or eliminate some of the more menial and repetitive labor tasks through process mapping. This will help to boost productivity and reduce monotony for your employees allowing them to focus on the more valuable aspects of their role.

Provides Access to Real-Time Data

The ability to access real-time location performance and freight data is potentially one of the most important advantages of logistics automation. With a wealth of actionable data at your fingertips in just one click you can create better business decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

Improves Customer Service and Satisfaction

Automation is essential in the delivery of any effective omnichannel strategy and has become a great way to deliver a streamlined customer experience. Your increased warehouse visibility empowers you to confidently relay to your customers each stage of their order’s journey along with perks like automatic transactional updates and real-time freight tracking.

Of course with the increased efficiency that automation provides customers can receive their orders quicker and with less chance of error making it an excellent way to boost your customer satisfaction rates.

Increases Speed and Provides Scalability

Logistics automation is perfect for the future-proofing and scaling of all business types whether it be small medium or large organizations. Being integrative with many different technologies logistics automation software ensures that you require no additional costly resources and are free to innovate according to your business goals.

Furthermore the time-effectiveness of logistics automation means that you will have more time to complete more orders and scale your business as a result – a feat that an order management system easily accommodates at little cost.

There are many more advantages to logistics automation but it’s crucial that you don’t dive into it headfirst. The initial investment cost of automation is high – often upwards of a million dollars – meaning that poor planning and hasty implementation can easily result in a negative ROI.

To ensure that your logistics automation efforts can function smoothly efficiently and cost-effectively it’s necessary to take some precautions in the implementation and execution of your strategy.

Implement a Warehouse Management System

A necessity to any automated warehouse is a Warehouse Management System (WMS). A WMS is a software program that assists with the integration of automation technologies into the workplace. A WMS is integral to inventory management as it tracks stock from the minute it enters the warehouse to the time it leaves all the while overseeing and managing inventory optimization picking putaway and more.

Integrating your WMS with Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) is a common best practice in order to get the most out of your inventory management. RTLS enables you to view the real-time location of assets and workers making it essential for route optimization.

Automate in Steps

While it might be tempting to jump into automation automating everything at once puts your company and its workers at risk of burnout and fatigue. It’s much wiser to introduce new automation strategies in steps and track the success of a single automation technology before implementing another.

Focus on your individual business goals rather than following trends. Analyze the areas of your workplace that are in most need of automation. For example if you highlight your manual inventory control system as a significant problem for productivity and efficiency you might want to concentrate on automating inventory management before moving onto product transportation automation or invoicing automation.

Always keep in mind that the most efficiently functioning automation strategies are well-researched and designed before they are implemented. This will ensure that you maximize your logistics automation functionality and your ROI potential.

Create an Efficient Data Migration Plan

If your data is being held in manual or semi-automated systems it’s vital that you create a migration plan to transfer data over to your new system. Many companies overlook the complexities of data migration as well as the detrimental effects that data silos can have across departments.

Additionally the data that your company has gathered on your old systems can prove incredibly useful for performance monitoring and future innovations so always make sure to create a comprehensive plan for how your data will be transferred.

Upskill Your Employees and Offer Training

Workplaces are becoming exceedingly digital. From video conferencing software to cloud-based platforms employees in every industry are continually having to grasp new technologies. For employees who are not technologically inclined this can be a serious adjustment that you need to be aware of.

However rather than hiring new workers take the time to upskill the workers you already have as they are the ones who are most accustomed to your business goals and culture.

Upskilling employees has been proven to have numerous benefits as evidenced by the graph below.

Make your employees aware of your automation goals as quickly as possible and offer training as you begin to implement them. This will streamline the process of implementation and maximize your logistics automation functionality.

You could even use websites for group collaboration so that employees can learn online and from home with the support of both colleagues and management.

Regularly Audit Your Automation System

There is a common misconception that once your automation system is up and running that it can be left to its own devices since it already undergo testing in production. However this couldn’t be further from the truth. Two of the biggest drawbacks of automation in the workplace are complacency and over-reliance both of which can lead to technical issues and vulnerabilities being overlooked.

Conducting audits every 6 to 12 months will highlight any technical issues. Furthermore it will enable you to track and analyze your logistics automation functionality over time and unveil any potential areas for improvement.

Ensure that you have a team of RPA experts dedicated to overseeing both the implementation and the continued running of your automated system. A huge benefit of the cloud-based automation system is that an RPA team does not even have to base themselves on-site – video collaboration tools enable you to form a dedicated RPA team with no restrictions regarding distance.

You can even utilize video conferencing HD solutions to make this process more efficient and accommodating.

To Sum Things Up

Logistics automation can assist you in the streamlining of daily processes and the reduction of costly human errors while bestowing you with enriched visibility of your workplace and the data it accumulates.

Meeting consumer demands and creating the ideal ecommerce customer experience is a very achievable goal once automation has been implemented. Automating inventory management creating optimal routes and minimizing touchpoints are just a few of the ways that you can utilize automation to ensure that your products are shipped as quickly as possible.

Always keep in mind that in order to maximize your logistics automation functionality it’s important that you don’t just dive straight in. You should be meticulously planning every step and implementing processes slowly to track performance. And of course your employees are crucial to the success of your automation strategy so make sure to offer them training and continued support throughout your journey.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The RCMP originally planned to start rolling out cameras by late 2021 — but it still hasn't awarded a contract.

""The exact timeline for the body worn camera rollout will be confirmed once a vendor is selected"" said RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Caroline Duval.

Back in 2020 Commissioner Brenda Lucki — responding to multiple controversies involving Mounties' use of force and allegations of systemic racism — agreed to outfit members with body-worn cameras and launch a digital evidence management system.

Citing ""an agile procurement process"" Duval said three companies — Axon Public Safety Canada Inc. Getac Video Solutions Ltd. and Motorola Solutions Canada Inc. — are competing for the contract.

""The RCMP and [Public Services and Procurement Canada] are engaged in a process to review and refine requirements with the three above noted vendors"" she said.

""Once complete a request for proposal will be launched. The field test will begin once the vendor is selected.""

The RCMP's original plan was to first introduce the cameras in selected rural urban and remote communities before issuing them to all officers who interact with the public.

While body-worn cameras have been widely embraced as a tool to improve police accountability some experts have said there isn't enough evidence to prove they improve policing.

Mounties in Nunavut wore cameras for six months as part of a pilot project; the detachment said officers recorded more than 3500 videos resulting from approximately 5000 calls. The RCMP is now evaluating that project.

The union representing thousands of boots-the-ground RCMP officers has said it supports the use of body-worn cameras but wants clearer guidelines on when they can be turned off.

The Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer reported that outfitting RCMP officers with body-worn cameras at 700 detachments will cost about $131 million over five years.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The crowd at the gate didn’t know it but the Marines had been told to close it at 6 p.m.

That left just 30 minutes for Capt.

Just 30 more minutes for Cpl. Hunter Lopez 22 to grab another child out of the sewage canal where hundreds jostled. Just 30 minutes for Capt.

When Lucille Ball ended her 20-year marriage with her husband (and I Love Lucy co-star) Desi Arnaz in 1960 she began dating the man who would become her second husband comedian and producer Gary Morton nearly a year after the divorce.

What drew the iconic entertainer to Morton may have been the fact that he simply wasn’t starstruck by her; in fact Morton maintained he never once watched an episode of the pioneering television series.

Lucille Ball began seeing Gary Morton after her divorce from Desi Arnaz

After 20 tumultuous years of marriage to her husband and I Love Lucy co-star Desi Arnaz the pair finally divorced in 1960. Nearly a year after the split Ball took a chance on finding love with another entertainer a comedian named Gary Morton. His looks Lucille: The Life of Lucille Ball author Kathleen Brady reported “were of the kind Lucy called ‘ugly/handsome’ a composite of broad rugged features that were wrong individually but balanced one another well.”

The two began dating Brady wrote soon after Morton had been introduced to Ball at a club and accidentally dipped his tie into her coffee as he went to shake her hand. She sent him three replacements he called to thank her and soon they were “considered ‘an item’ and he was referred to as ‘Lucille Ball’s boyfriend’ in various columns.”

Morton said he never watched ‘I Love Lucy’

Perhaps the redheaded icon’s attraction to Morton was explained Ball’s biographer surmised by “the struggling comedian” being unimpressed with Ball’s career accomplishments and more taken with the woman herself: “Gary seemed oblivious of the achievements that so impressed everyone else. He claimed that because he so often worked in clubs on Monday nights he had never seen I Love Lucy.”

To Ball “Gary was his own person. She liked him but she did not love him.” The couple married in New York in November of 1961 with Morton signing on to a prenuptial agreement. “‘I look forward’ she told journalists ‘to a nice quiet life.’ With that she ended her marriage to Desi Arnaz.”

For equally iconic comedian Bob Hope it was beyond him why his longtime friend Ball would settle down to marry Morton. In Hope’s view the mother of two needed to be with someone in her own sphere as Brady noted: “That one of the most respected and richest people in show business would take up with a second banana amazed those who did not know her well. ‘What are you going around with that kid for?’ Bob Hope asked.

“Had she looked for a man her equal she would have needed Hope himself or the head of a major corporation someone whose life was as driven and demanding as her own.”

Ball and Morton remained married until her death on April 26 1989.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYXpiaWdtZWRpYS5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvbG9vcC0zMDMtY29ycmlkb3ItYmVjb21lcy1nbG9iYWwtY2VudGVyLWZvci1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Loop 303 corridor becomes global center for development,"The drive along the 36-mile length of the Loop 303 freeway in the West Valley takes well under an hour. The trip goes fast but not quite as fast as the land along the 303 is being gobbled up by developers and filled with massive manufacturing and logistics facilities.

“Developers from all parts of the country have been planting flags in that area. For the most part that corridor is spoken for” said John Lydon vice president at JLL who represented one of those newcomers to Arizona CRG which purchased land near Reems Road and Northern Avenue in Glendale near the intersection of the 303 and Northern Parkway. CRG which is based in Chicago is teaming up with Phoenix developer Bird Dog industrial to build a 5.5 million square foot industrial park called The Cubes at Glendale.

From the freeway’s southern origin at the I-10 north to Olive Ave. major developments are underway. The 1600-acre PV | 303 was the first development along the freeway and has since gotten company with other major developments like Park303 Camelback 303 Woolf Logistics West 303 Logistics and Sarival Logistics all planning to bring many millions of square feet of development.

“You could start calling that area the West Valley Empire similar to the Inland Empire over in California” added Lydon. “Its a fair comparison with the amount of growth and the amount of corporate activity that seems to just keep going.”

Currently all of the activity along the 303 is industrial and logistics but a recent announcement could shift that trend. At the other end of the 303 where the freeway meets up with I-17 in north Phoenix global giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) purchased 1129 acres of former State Trust Land just north of the 303 and south of Hwy 74 and revealed plans to build a $12 billion factory.

“We zoned 3500 acres over the summer so we zoned the land that has boundaries including the 74 and the 303 and the 17 and Dead Man’s wash” said City of Phoenix Economic Development Director Christine Mackay. “That we zoned for economic development purposes. TSM was the successful bidder at the auction most recently so they got close to 1200 acres. That is of course our anchor tenant and it’s exactly the anchor tenant that you would want. Someone that is globally recognized in advanced industries. It unlocks the potential of the balance of that 2300 remaining acres as a science and technology park as high-end office as flex tech and manufacturing that is along that technology front.”

With the arrival of TSM the story of the 303 adds a new chapter one of huge economic impact that stretches the full length of the freeway.

The beginning

The 303’s origins date back to the 1985 Maricopa County Regional Transportation Plan that was approved by voters. The freeway was originally scheduled to be completed in 2005 but a variety of setbacks pushed the completion all the way to 2017.

The freeway cut through farm land and state trust land for the majority of its route but there was already residential development along some stretches notably Surprise and Sun City.

Well before the freeway was completed SunCor was at work making plans to develop 1600 acres on both sides of the 303 started on the west side of the 303 at Thomas and stretching north to Camelback. In 2009 SunCor sold the land to John Graham and Sunbelt Holdings who formed a partnership with Merit Partners to develop what they called PV|303.

“For those who don’t know what “PV” stands for – it’s Palm Valley which is a development in Goodyear” said Kevin Czerwinski president of Merit Partners which is also developing the 615 acre Camelback 303 industrial park. “The purchase of what is now PV|303 occurred in July 2010 when there wasn’t the Loop 303 freeway there was negative absorption of industrial real estate and it was very difficult to find a financial partner for such a large purchase of land. John Graham had the vision and guts to move forward in what was a dicey time in our market.”

The PV|303 development began to attract some marquee tenants including REI Dick’s Sporting Goods and Ball Corporation. So far Merit Partners has developed ten buildings at PV|303 totaling 4.6 million square feet. Czerwinski said that Merit is also currently under construction on two more buildings that will add 1.3 million more square feet of product to the market.

“We also have five other buildings in the site plan approval process totaling approximately 1.8 million square feet with construction commencing in the third quarter of 2021 which will consist of buildings from 120000 square feet to 650000 square feet that will be expandable” said Czerwinski.

Czerwinski said that there are currently seven developments currently in the works along the 303. In the next six months Czerwinski said there will be nearly five million square feet of product breaking ground in that area.

“There are several developers/investors that have placed their bets on many of the remaining sites along both sides of the Loop 303” Czerwinski said.

Place your bets

The rush of activity along the 303 was triggered by a number of factors chief among them being the rising costs of development in California. Slowly companies were starting to realize they could build a distribution center or manufacturing plant in the West Valley of Phoenix for much less than a facility would cost in the major cities in California. And the ports of Long Beach and the border with Mexico were within a few hours’ drive by truck.

“The Southwest Valley of Phoenix has always been the industrial and manufacturing corridor” said John Orsak vice president for Lincoln Property Company which is developing the Park303. “You can get to the ports in six hours drop your shipment and get back home all within allowable times. And the further west you are the closer you are to those ports. It makes sense that industrial is going to locate closer to the ports.”

Orsak said LPC was fortunate in their timing to acquire the 265 acres that make up Park303 which is along the east side of the 303 at Glendale Ave. Orsak said a land partner had brought the property to LPC well before any other developers had expanded that far north along the freeway.

“We went out there and I remember taking our partners out there and they said ‘Wow this PV|303 stuff looks great. Why are you still driving North? Where are you going?” Orsak said. “We went two exits up and it’s good flat big parcels and you can put big buildings on it. It was pretty easy to see.

“We were validated whenever Covid came along and set the e-commerce world on fire. Now all of these big boxes and the demand for e-commerce and distribution is like nothing we’ve ever seen before.”

That demand is what is leading companies like CRG to make their first foray into Arizona. Lydon said that he started working with Mark Sonnenburg from Bird Dog Industrial and his partners at CRG to identify land in the corridor that CRG could purchase. Initially Lydon found 100 acres but soon CRG realized that there was more potential in that market that they wanted to seize upon.

“As the search progressed they really became bullish on Phoenix’s future and decided to take a much bigger stake out of the 260 acres that they just closed on and we’ll be closing on an additional 80 acres here in March to bring the grand total of the park to 335 acres so three times the size that they had originally planned for.”

Lydon said The Cubes will complement the other developments along the corridor quite well. He said The Cubes is unique in that it is highly flexible well suited for any customer needing 150000 square feet of space or more.

“These buildings offer capability and flexibility” said Lydon who also noted that his information puts the amount of acres still in play for developers along the 303 at just 1400. “We’ll be coming out with a 1.2 million square foot spec building breaking ground in March as well as we have the capability to offer build to suit options for lease or sale.”

Nearly all of the buildings along the 303 are speculative as developers want to get product to the market as quickly as possible.

“You’ve got to move fast” said Orsak. “That’s why we’ve been building our buildings spec because people aren’t willing to wait a year year and a half to get into something. They need to go now and the West Valley municipalities have figured that out and have not stood in the way.”

The next frontier

The majority of initial development along the 303 was happening in Goodyear but in the past year Glendale has been the center of most of the new activity. Other municipalities along the 303 are working to take advantage of the freeway access.

In Surprise the 303 transitions into a lifestyle amenity-anchored corridor with retail and residential opportunities. In 2020 Costco opened a new location in Surprise along the 303 on Waddell Rd. and City of Surprise Economic Development Director Jeanine Jerkovic said that triggered more development in the area.

“Simon CRE has submitted a Prasada Village Master Plan proposal that offers more than 890000 square feet of retail restaurants and entertainment uses in that corridor” Jerkovic noted. “There are opportunities for future office and manufacturing campus development as well.”

As the freeway travels north and east there’s very little activity when it hits the Phoenix borders but that will not be the case for much longer. Mackay said that the amount of land along the freeway that resides in the City of Phoenix totals 12000 acres much of which is still State Trust Land. The arrival of the TSM facility will likely set off a chain reaction in that area.

“If the potential of that facility can be fully realized could it be analogous to the role that Intel plays down in Chandler?” asked Larry Pobuda executive vice president at The Opus Group. “Intel has spawned not only this very large anchor of a company down in Chandler but a key residential market a number of companies want to be down in Chandler because of Intel and its adjacencies and strong retail strong demographics well educated workforce. That’s the closest analogy that I could make as to the possibilities and that’s tremendously exciting.”

“It will have a positive impact for all product types in the West and Northwest Valley” added Czerwinski. “The number of jobs that will be created by TSM and their tier 2 suppliers and additional tiers of the supply chain will be a fantastic opportunity for all aspects of real estate — industrial retail flex/office residential multi-family etc.”

Mackay who served as economic development director for the City of Chandler from 1998 to 2014 is very familiar with what impact a company like TSM can make for a region.

“To us we’ve got this incredible opportunity that was quite frankly not in any economic development short term radar until about a year ago” Mackay said. “It’s even surprising me how quickly that the 303 is drawing business into the area.”",,,,,,

The improvements followed a late-summer lull caused by the latest coronavirus surge and by supply chain problems that have delayed shipments hampered manufacturers and left gaps on supermarket shelves.

This balancing act is now at risk. On October 27th the fast-food giant said that due to rising costs prices at its American restaurants will increase by 6% this year compared with 2020. The burger chain says labour expenses have risen by 10% at its franchised restaurants and 15% at its company-owned locations. Add the rising cost of ingredients and the result is higher prices for burgers and fries. For now it seems customers can stomach it. Chris Kempczinski McDonald’s boss said the increase “has been pretty well received”. After digesting the news investors have sent shares in the fast-food firm up by 6%.

A growing number of companies are raising prices as costs for labour and raw materials rise often with no ill effects. This summer PepsiCo an American food giant lifted prices for its fizzy drinks and snacks to offset higher commodity and transport costs; it plans further increases early next year. Ramon Laguarta the firm’s boss suggested in an earnings call in October that customers do not seem bothered. “Across the world consumers seem to be looking at pricing a little bit differently than before” he said.

But one of the newest additions to the scene is finding an audience with people across multiple industries central to the city who are looking for an upgraded experience when it comes to both networking and working remotely.

Zero Bond was originally supposed to open in April 2020 but obviously the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdown prevented that. The club ended up opening later that year in October and the site recently celebrated its first anniversary. (Although the site did have to shut down again briefly for eight weeks during the winter of 2020 into 2021 in accordance with New York City ordinances when indoor venue restrictions were reimposed.)

“New York City has long been missing a social club that is truly reflective of the diversity that makes this city so special. I wanted to create a London-style social club in New York that catered to this mixture of people—to creatives and actors as well as doctors bankers athletes and more” Zero Bond founder Scott Sartiano tells Fortune. “To me the sign of a great night is a fantastic meal or cocktail incredible service and leaving having met someone I wouldn’t have otherwise in any other place. That’s the experience I wanted to create for our members at Zero Bond.”

While Zero Bond exists primarily as a social club in the post-COVID world coworking is something the venue wants to expand upon as more people continue to work remotely a few days per week if not full-time.

“The main difference is that at Zero Bond we’re creating a community that really reflects New York” says founder Scott Sartiano. “We’re not sticking to one group of people or one profession so every time you visit you’re as likely to see a friend as you are to meet someone new.” Courtesy of Zero Bond

Located at the corner of Bond Street in Manhattan’s NoHo district the building was constructed in 1874 and first housed a Brooks Brothers factory. The design team kept as much of the original architecture as possible: All the brickwork is original as well as the restored concrete slabs.

The space was designed by Bill Sofield whose portfolio includes high-end luxury boutiques for the likes of Yves Saint Laurent and hospitality projects such as the lobby of the Soho Grand. The Zero Bond team wanted all the materials and finishes to make guests feel cozy versus the atmosphere found in a standard restaurant or stuffy office space.

“We want you to come to Zero Bond and the staff knows your name. You can always find a seat and you are regularly meeting new people you wouldn’t elsewhere” Sartiano explains. “Every aspect of the Zero Bond experience has been selected with our community in mind from the art we’ve curated for the space to the food and beverage offerings to even the materials used for the furniture. Everything was carefully selected to make you feel more comfortable and for Zero Bond to be your elevated home away from home.”

When the elevator doors part the first area members will see is the café with abundant natural light making it an ideal spot for working remotely. It’s also one of the few places where people can use laptops and take phone calls including later on in the evening.

The café leads into an atrium with a fully retractable skylight that opens on nicer days and a handful of soundproof phone booths where members can conduct Zoom calls. In a nod to the neighborhood’s roots this room is decorated with pieces by local artists—a few by Warhol and Haring but also some up-and-comers.

And Zero Bond’s collection could rival that of some neighboring galleries thanks to partnership with the Noho Collective a local artists’ group that was at the forefront of the BLM street art movement.

“As we built out our food and beverage program I made sure to provide a mix of options so members can visit two or three times a week and enjoy different dining experiences every time—from omakase and caviar service to more traditional options like wood-fired pizza and rib eye” says Sartiano. Courtesy of Zero Bond

The main areas for members to meet and socialize are the salon and the lounge. All the spaces within Zero Bond are open seating and first come first served. Members are allowed to bring three guests; exceptions are possible for larger parties when the venue can accommodate them. And they can reserve the private dining room which operates as a conference room during the day for private dinners seating between 18 and 20 people.

Before opening Zero Bond Sartiano says that he and managing partner Will Makris found that “a certain part of the 28- to 50-year-old” age bracket in New York was overlooked in terms of places they could go to socialize. “Other than hotel bars options were limited when it came to more elevated places to take a date or go for drinks after dinner with friends” Sartiano explains. “While there’s no one ‘person’ or specific demographic that we’re looking for at Zero Bond we definitely had this group in mind when creating the space.”

Sartiano stresses that health and safety are top priorities as well noting that Zero Bond was one of the first venues in the city to implement Remark Holdings’ A.I.-powered Biosafety Thermal Kits which provided discreet temperature checks at all entry points for employees staff and guests. “This was the same technology used by other venues such as the Wynn casino in Las Vegas and provided for a much more seamless customer experience entering the club without the intrusive human contact of a typical temperature check” he says. “My goal was to create a welcoming new environment for our members that felt clean and safe but also comforting as we slowly returned to socializing.”

The club’s grill restaurant is one of the few areas where reservations are accepted for dinner. With an elevated take on modern American cuisine the kitchen’s menu is overseen by Richard Farnabe whose résumé includes other New York hotspots such as Daniel and Mercer Kitchen. Also hidden away is the sushi bar; Zero Bond management notes that it is the only social club in New York offering an omakase menu.

“Zero Bond was always created to serve as a social club but we also provide spaces for members to work throughout the day host lunch meetings grab a quick coffee etc.” says Sartiano. “We’ve made a conscious effort to keep those aspects separate because there’s nothing that ruins the vibe more than going for a drink at 10 p.m. and sitting next to someone still on their laptop. We want to empower our members to use the space for both work and play.”

Zero Bond’s library curated with books from luxury publisher Assouline doubles as a pop-up site for various brands. Right now Zero Bond is hosting a pop-up by skin care brand Dr. Barbara Sturm. Members can treat themselves to on-site facials. (But they must pay out of pocket as products and services offered by the pop-ups are not covered by the club’s membership fee.)

Sartiano adds that Zero Bond has started hosting speakers and comedians along with discussions on topics of interest to members as well as other specialty programming such as whiskey and wine tastings. “My long-term vision is for Zero Bond to become a staple and generational hub in New York City. I want my son and his friends to want to become members once they’re old enough and for them to come and enjoy the space alongside my friends and me. That would be my ultimate goal.”

The social club also makes a significant amount of revenue from hosting third-party events either on the rooftop patio or the cocktail bar one floor below the main rooms. The lower-level bar has its own bespoke cocktail program intended to serve as a hangout spot for members on Friday and Saturday nights. Off to the side of the cocktail bar is a locked room for which members have their own keys. Evoking a speakeasy vibe the room also has lockers for members who wish to store their own wine on the premises.

Membership to Zero Bond is $3000 a year with a one-time initiation fee of $1000. That membership fee covers access to the building and all the facilities but any drinks meals event tickets etc. are not covered and must be paid for à la carte. “We also didn’t want to create a space where only rich New Yorkers can afford to go” Sartiano says. “We made sure the membership fees were reasonable and not a barrier to entry to ensure we’re getting a really well-rounded group of members.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1ZmZldHRzLWJlcmtzaGlyZS1oYXRoYXdheS1ib29zdHMtb3BlcmF0aW5nLXByb2ZpdC1sb3dlci1zdG9jay1nYWlucy1odXJ0LW5ldC0yMDIxLTExLTA2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supply chain problems crimp profit at Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway; cash sets record,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-boosts-operating-profit-lower-stock-gains-hurt-net-2021-11-06/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1ZmZldHRzLWJlcmtzaGlyZS1oYXRoYXdheS1ib29zdHMtb3BlcmF0aW5nLXByb2ZpdC1sb3dlci1zdG9jay1nYWlucy1odXJ0LW5ldC0yMDIxLTExLTA2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Now it has raised $100 million to fuel its growth a round of funding that values H2O.ai at $1.7 billion post-money ($1.6 billion pre-money).

This is a Series E round and it’s being led by a strategic backer the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) which has been a customer of the startup and will be using the backing to kick off a deeper partnership between the two to build new services. Others in the round include Goldman Sachs Pivot Investment Partners Crane Venture Partners and Celesta Capital. Further plans for the funding include building more products for H2O.ai as a whole and hiring more talent to continue expanding the company’s H2O AI Hybrid Cloud platform.

This is not the first time that a customer has led a round as a strategic backer: in 2019 Goldman Sachs led the company’s Series D of $72.5 million. As a sign of how the company has been growing and the general appetite for what it does H2O’s valuation has leapfrogged since that last round when it was valued at $400 million per PitchBook data. Mountain View-based H2O.ai has raised $246.5 million to date.

The fact that both of the last rounds have been led by big banks that are also customers of H2O.ai’s speaks a lot to where the opportunity has been for the startup. Sri Ambati the founder and CEO (who previously was also a co-founder of Platfora which was acquired by Workday) told me over email that about 40% of the company’s revenues currently come from the very wide and all-encompassing world of financial services.

“Retail banking credit cards payments — almost every payment system from PayPal to MasterCard are customers of H2O” he said. On the equities side companies power fixed income asset management and mortgage backed security services using H2O’s technology with MarketAxess Franklin Templeton and BNY Mellon also “strong” customers he said.

That is also seeing a growing complement of business from other verticals he added: Unilever Reckitt P&G are among those in consumer goods; UPS is one of its users in logistics and delivery; Chipotle is among those in food services; and he said that AT&T “is one of our largest customers.”

Covid-19 has had a role to play here too.

“Manufacturing became a fast-growing vertical due to supply chain disruption and demand sensing” he said of the pandemic. “We launched H2O AI Health to help our hospitals and providers payers like Aetna and pharma customers.”

Notably H2O.ai is also now breaking ground into working more with other tech companies that want to build more AI into their own workflows to in turn provide services to their own customers. “Our latest wins are in vertical clouds and SaaS ISVs” Ambati said.

The company has offered an open source component to its services which it calls simply H2O from its earliest days and that is now used by over 20000 enterprises. Part of the reason for that is its flexibility: H2O.ai says that its open source framework works both on top of existing big data infrastructure on bare metal or on top of existing Hadoop Spark or Kubernetes clusters and is able to ingest data directly from HDFS Spark S3 Azure Data Lake or any other data source into it’s in-memory distributed key-value store.

“Our open source platform gives freedom and ability for customers to build their own AI centers of competence and excellence” Ambati said of the open source tools. “We are like the Tenzing Sherpas of the AI mountains helping our customers to traverse and conquer AI peaks.”

That framework can be used by engineers to build customized applications while H2O.ai’s proprietary tools provide more completed applications in areas like fraud detection churn prediction anomaly detection price optimization and credit scoring — areas that can benefit from the ingestion of massive amounts of data in order to gain better insights into what might happen next: these sit either as a complement to what human analysts and data scientists might be able to unearth or potentially in some cases as a replacement for the more basic work they might do. In all there are currently some 45 applications in all.

The plan Ambati said is to over time build out more of these which will reside in “app stores” in specific verticals offering a range of its proprietary pre-built tools particular to the demands of each of them.

The trend fueling H2O.ai’s growth has been gaining momentum for several years now.

Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for the world of enterprise IT: used well tools like machine learning natural language processing and computer vision can speed up productivity or even open up completely new areas of opportunity for an organization. Over time it can save companies billions of dollars in operational and other costs.

One big issue however is that in many cases organizations might lack the internal teams to build or carry through projects that use AI and that’s before considering the fact that as needs and parameters evolve all of that infrastructure will need updating too. Technology touches everything in an enterprise these days but not every enterprise is a tech company.

H2O.ai is not the first or only startup that has aimed to fill this gap in the market although it seems to have managed its task a little more successfully than others.

Notably Element.AI out of Canada was built out on the back of a large amount of funding and buy-in from big tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia also to address the idea of democratizing AI for the wider world of enterprises that might lack the resources to build and run AI tools themselves but could very much benefit from them before their businesses simply get cannibalized by the many AI-fuelled tech companies moving into their spaces. It had a strong focus on integration (it was a little like an Accenture for AI services) but never managed to make a big enough jump from concept to business and was eventually acquired in 2020 by ServiceNow to complement its own efforts to build tools for businesses.

Ambati said that only about 10% of H2O.ai’s business is in the area of services with the remainder 90% coming from its products as an explanation for why one startup’s approach worked while another did not.

“It is easy to get lured by services in data science and AI” he said. “Being true to our product maker culture and yet building deep customer empathy and listening is critical to success. Customers experience our maker culture and become makers themselves. We are continuously making our software easier (democratizing) low-code reusable recipes and automation through AI Cloud and building data pipelines AI AppStores and delivering AI as a service that our customers can use to improve their customer experiences brands and communities.

“The big difference — we are raising a forest not just a tree. H2O AI Cloud H2O Wave our low-code Application Development H2O AI AppStores Marketplace and H2O-3 Open Source ML are at the core of AI Applications and software already and we are partnering with customers and their ecosystem of partners and developers.”

Uzbekneftegaz will place international bonds on the London Stock Exchange Spot reports referring to a corresponding resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers adopted on November 3.

A bond issue of up to $700 million is scheduled for November 2021. The organizers are Bank GPB Citi J.P. Morgan and MUFG legal consultant is White & Case LLP.

Also branches of New York Mellon Bank in London and Dublin will help the company in placing bonds registering their issue and making payments.

As an exception Uzbekneftegaz is allowed to conclude contracts with them as well as with the auditing company EY and the London Stock Exchange without state expertise.

The funds will be transferred to the treasury account of Uzbekneftegaz and used for its financial recovery in agreement with the Ministry of Finance. The company undertakes to fulfill the financial conditions on time as well as to report on the use of the attracted funds.

In September Uzbekneftegaz received its first credit rating from Fitch. The rating is identical to that of the government bonds of Uzbekistan – “BB-” with a “stable” outlook. S&P Global Ratings gave a similar assessment.

In addition to Uzbekneftegaz UzAuto Motors issued Eurobonds in 2021. Also this year Uzbekistan for the first time in Central Asia issued international bonds in soums.",,,,,,,,,

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An $800 Rental Bath Makeover Goes from “Drab” to Fab,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/drab-rental-bathroom-makeover-37397824 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuY29tL3J1Z2J5L2dhbGxhZ2hlci1wcmVtaWVyc2hpcC1zYWxlLWNsaW1iLWludG8tdG9wLWZvdXItd2l0aC1ib251cy1wb2ludC13aW4tb3Zlci1sZWljZXN0ZXItYmF0aC1icnVzaC1uZXdjYXNfc3RvMTAxMzk0NjIvc3Rvcnkuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gallagher Premiership: Sale beat Leicester to climb into top four Bath close in on playoffs with Newcastle win,"Sam James of Sale Sharks celebrates scoring a try during the Gallagher Premiership Rugby match between Sale Sharks and Leicester Tigers at AJ Bell Stadium on May 10 2024 in Salford England.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

CODA was a notable film making a name for itself at Sundance by winning the US Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Film. And now with the fall awards season underway it could very well do well in the 2021 awards season (Read more about that here as well as Joey’s review here).

With that in mind Awards Radar had the opportunity to talk to the composing duo Nick Baxter and Marius De Vries about their work on the film. They have worked on various films throughout their careers and so they discussed how they work together and the process of making the music for CODA. Altogether this was an inspiring discussion. Enjoy the interview below.

Benjamin: How did you two get involved with CODA?

Marius: And closely following on that step was to quickly start working with Emilia who plays the character Ruby and see what we could do with her voice. At the start of this project Emilia was not a proven singer so we had to take her under our wing and get her in with some singing teachers to develop her vocal abilities. And that was a really interesting part of the process because the journey that she went on as an actress learning how to sing and learning how to sign was something that mapped onto the performance she needed to give in the film. Ruby starts off rather timid and shy unable to project her voice and lacking confidence and that was a little bit like how Emilia was when we sat her down in a studio and started working through stuff. So I think she was able to use the experience of us encouraging her and sometimes bullying her into rapid improvement in her vocal abilities and I think she was able to take that experience and apply it to her performance in the movie.

Benjamin: You guys mentioned you made CODA a collab and you have worked together on various projects throughout your careers. How has the dynamic between you two changed from the first collaboration to CODA?

Nick: Working with Marius is such a thrill and it’s so easy and you learn to appreciate being around good people and musical people and people that can make the process fun. We are making music and entertainment at the end of the day so you need to keep that in mind.

Marius interjecting: You mean I don’t take it too seriously?

Nick chuckling: we have to have fun and I think we have developed a shorthand over the years. We know what each other’s strengths are which is great. We can bounce stuff off of each other.

Marius: We’ve done a lot of different styles of movies together for sure but also I have sort of dragged Nick into the record production world a little bit too. We’ve done albums together with Chrissie Hynde and Rufus Wainwright during that period. We’ve covered a lot of territories and I think doing that and working often together in high-pressure situations has enabled us to rely on each other in ways we wouldn’t have previously. It’s almost like an Elite Navy Seal Unit and we know that nobody is going to be left behind. So there’s a fundamental level of trust and we’ve seen so many different situations together. I’ve been thrilled seeing this relationship blossom and it was good to see it take its next form with our collaboration on CODA.

Benjamin: That’s inspiring to hear its super cool hearing about that change and seeing the results in CODA. So speaking of the music in CODA what was challenging about CODA from a production standpoint? How did its focus on both the Hearing and deaf experiences impact the songwriting for the film?

Marius: There were many logistical practical production and even budgetary challenges with the making of CODA but you touch on an interesting point. And it’s one that Sian and I identified the very first time we sat down to have dinner and talk about this film. We knew this movie was always going to bring into focus the question which is always interesting in movie scoring but never really so nuanced as here. And it’s that relationship between silence music and storytelling. And we knew we were going to have to deal with that but we didn’t quite know-how. And it was only when we got to post-production when we saw the long ASL dialogue scenes cut together without music that we realized they weren’t silent. There is so much detail from the rubbing of the clothes against the body and the slapping of the hands and the smacking of the lips and the *rubs hands together*. There’s like an emotional percussive score that is born out of the foley the production sound that was captured on film. And that really made us question in the first half of the movie if we needed a score as we got used to that world and learning to trust the percussion inherent to ASL. You could support the emotion of the scene just by allowing the really real production soundtrack to be the mix. And music became rather unwelcome in those early scenes. And it gave us the ability to bleed the narrative music into the film slowly as Ruby gains confidence in her abilities as a singer and in herself as she transitions into adulthood. It centers the music with Ruby in her entire arc of the film with her exploration of a first relationship and as she manages the dreadful tug of war with her responsibilities to her family and her desires to follow what she’s convinced her dream is. And so because we made the first half of the film so still and empty we had a very powerful musical strategy in our back pocket to let the score blossom as the main character is. But it was a challenge to discover how to do that. And it’s always difficult to throw out the music you wrote for the film. I was fully on the side of that decision fairly quickly but there was a lot of music that was abandoned because of that strategy. Nick: and I would say to add onto that from my side of things the biggest challenge with CODA was that it had to be raw organic and authentic to this world. At the end of the day it’s a lot easier to make a big sugary musical where everything is clean and bright and polished. And it’s much harder to make a musical that is gritty and feels embedded in that world and that was something that Sian laid down as a directive from Day one. So that’s how we approached putting the music together and it meant recording a lot of live stuff on set. And that led to spending a lot more time in post mining all that material. But it was also the biggest opportunity with the film and what made it so much fun to work on. It’s a lot of work but so worth it at the end and especially with a film like this.

Benjamin: How did you create the live choir performances for the film? How did you create this soundscape as music producers?

Nick: To get the sound right you have to start thinking about it before you even shoot. You have to know what you’re doing in each scene how you’re going to film it and make sure you’re actors are prepared. You need to be collaborating with the sound team and have a good game plan going into production before you can do anything else. And on the same token you need to be flexible and willing to adapt. Because if you miss that opportunity to get the sound on set it’s very very difficult to recreate it later. Whatever small sound bytes you can get go a long way to help the post-production process. And I think just having that game plan from day one and making sure the cast was able and willing to do a live performance of the songs. Not every actor is able to give a vocal performance in movies. But Emilia put the work in to give this performance as did the choir. And Sian was willing to put the work in on set to make it happen. That’s where the music starts for us because once you have those sounds you can work with it in post. And while there is still work to be done in post-production it’s a lot easier when you have the sounds you need from the set available to you so that’s the biggest step.

Benjamin: CODA has a folk sound to the score and to the choir performances; which can be very different from the music that Ruby listens to in the film. Since you compiled the music for the film first were there any other ideas of what the score would sound like that were more aligned with Ruby’s musical preferences?

Nick: Marius could probably talk to this more than me but I think having a little bit of the musical language established helped dictate the score. We had a lot of conceptual conversations early on about what the score would be whether that would be electronic or ringing or ambient sounds. But I think that our decision to start bringing over the acoustic sounds from the live performances was very helpful. In adding instruments rooted in folk we were able to give continuity to the songs tieing together Ruby’s desires to the choir through the score in a musical way. And once we went there it became a natural progression from one point to the next which was very helpful.

Marius: Yeah it’s not so much that as we turned our attention to the score that it was influenced by the songs melodically or production-wise. But in terms of instrumentation and when you think about the soundscape the gentle organic acoustic guitar/stroke piano accompaniment was really born out of the enforced nakedness of the way they performed in the school choir or in rehearsal in Ruby’s bedroom or even at the school concert. That choice of having radically simple arrangement language bled into the score so that even as we allowed for more instruments the tone was kept consistent throughout. And that led to the final song which we saw as a definitive part of the story. It’s not just a coda; a postscript but rather a fundamental part of the story. And we wanted that final song to be built out of the musical texture of the movie while having to round out the entire movie. Just as Both sides now asks the question of what happens to your view of life when you look at it from a different perspective we were able to use Beyond the Shore to examine how Ruby would grow going forward.

Benjamin: Beyond the Shore really sits with you and is reflective of that journey away from home towards the next step of life. It feels super personal and I was wondering if you put any of your own journeys into that song through its lyrics and composition.

Marius: First of all we had to put ourselves into it on behalf of Ruby to write it from her point of view. And it was amazingly helpful having Sian as a contributing lyricist in having that extra directorial perspective on what the subject might be and how Ruby might be looking at things from the future. But in terms of the composition for me it was burying ourselves in the aesthetic of the movie though Nick can speak more towards how we found our motivation for it.

Nick: Yeah I would agree that it really helped to have Sian paint a picture for us to start as it’s always helpful to have a clear direction. And she gave us very clear direction; she painted a clear image of what she was looking for from the song. So we were able to use that direction as a jumping-off point. And we tried to keep the feel and instrumentation of the song consistent with the rest of the language from the film. And at the end of the day it kinda helped that we wrote the song during Covid when everyone was isolated as it gave us more time to think about the lyrics. But it also limited us from going overboard with the production and kept it tonally consistent with the rest of the film. It’s simple rooted in an acoustic guitar playing an arpeggiated part and I think that works with the lyrics and helps the song.

Benjamin: That’s amazing. Thank you both so much for bringing the score of CODA to life it’s one of my favourite films of the year.

Nick and Marius in unison: Thank you so much Benjamin it has been nice talking to you.

Coda is now available to stream on Apple TV+.

Baxter Dury

O2 Ritz Manchester

4th November 2021

Manchester welcomes the poet laureate of Ladbroke Grove Baxter Dury and his band – Madelaine Hart (keys) Lee Canham (bass) Shaun Paterson (guitar) and Adam Gammage (drums). Ryan Walker is transfixed by this musical raconteur.

Supporting tonight are fellow Heavenly label mates Audiobooks. A band bursting with ideas. I went in blind and came out baffled. David Wrench and Evangeline Ling conjure up a hybrid of styles ranging from Lydia Lunch’s frantic frenzied howls in the raw sonic scalpings in 8 Eyed Spy to the seismic sprawling psychedelic mosaics as assembled by the Orb or darker heavier grittier-crystals-between-the-teeth workouts of Underworld.

They leave me impressed amused intrigued as to what methods are put in place to make sure that whatever is thrown against the wall and sticks is the stuff disposed of. For Audiobooks the stuff that falls to the floor or drops into the bucket is perfect material to manipulate and make do with. The set is tight complex and messy. Its intensely dense oddly assembled and well-executed. Pop with a capital P it can be whatever they want and make it work make it shine under the watchful wacky auspice of Pop.

Moving on…

I’m not watching Baxter Dury I’m watching Mr. Maserati. Baxter Dury has been temporarily stuffed into a box and placed under the bed. There’s a book for sale with his name on it a signature on a blank page not far past its front cover. But the Baxter we all know is elsewhere.

Some spellbinding showman takes his place. Draped from head to toe in combat clothing stalking the stage like a snake slides through the desert. A ringleader with no top hat but a military helmet in its place. Scars concealed by camouflage. Big beige boots British army body armour. A man held up by some invisible puppet strings and with each twist and turn and fitful twitch managing to captivate the crowd as soon as new single DOA from newly announced best of Mr. Maserati: Best Of album from 2001-2021 shakes the room in a blaze of grime-inspired razor-sharp street-smart lyrical agility to slice open the twilight with the grills on show and the jewellery dangling heavy.

With blood on its bare-fist beats and spit in the wink of any bastard and bystander this devilish Maserati hangs from the microphone like a man with a crooked posture nailed to his mechanical crucifix fearing for his life with the confidence of a lion tamer that one wrong word will surely tear him limb from limb.

But still Maserati jives.

As does keys player Madelaine Hart. A piece of a star’s point stood unpinned to the floorboard planks. An animated statue on the move a glam ballerina under a bell jar only she can see stood before a synthesizer and making the harmonies tingle.

West End chanson grooves carry moods whereby Tekelon-Numan meets like Flowers Of Romance-Lydon lurching and lunging like he could lynch you in a flick of his wrists for all the audience to absorb and adore to nothing below a communal boil of rapture and reciprocation tomfoolery and kooky mechanical choreography.

Maserati is a man fresh from a fight. Bandanna wrapped around his head glowing maraca used as some invaluable object a defensive symbol to worship when raised above his loose-screw head. From familiar opener Leak At The Disco to classic Slumlord this undesirable Ziggy at the Ritz who jerks and jolts to the throb mutant-funk of Almond Milk punked up to the extremes with extra phlegm and ferocity in replacement of Jason Williamson with Sleaford Mods who serenades a sea of coned cardboard party hats worn by the night chancers charged when sharing the same space at the same time as Porcelain lovingly unleashes itself in ripples of delicate Gainsbourg-in-the-gutter melodies and infectious James Chance-meets-Jim Morrisson alchemical cool to charmingly cast spells to tug on the arrow’s tail and shoot it through the sweeps of euphoric air composed of cigarette smoke and dry ice.

A gangster who glistens the more the audience listens lingering to each lyrical spillage each propulsive slick-garage rhythm snappy and succinct and spiky in constant uncluttered motion. Engrossing the soul the more Maserati gets closer to the edge of the stage his puppeteer nowhere to be seen but sweetly felt in Maserati’s delightful Hyde. Detected in the clumsily-calculated bashful and brilliant magic tricks like he’s trying to detach himself from something above and subtle slights of hand tangled in tight wires. Snippets of fidgety insanity make intangible items on offer appear seductive even more so when he pretends to put things in pockets to evaporate and disappear with pathos and bravado interlinked at the seams adding to the attractiveness of the act the inability to not feel included and beguiled by the unpredictable wildness of it all.

The deranged and disjointed severed soft cells and synth-pop swirl of Pleasure the always epic psyche-waltz Palm Trees and intoxicating acid-blast and Jah-wobble throb of Miami with its forceful thudding footsteps and guttural galvanic charge primitive Joy Division mini-synth symphonies and mobile phone melodies magnified with Arabian madness elongated here to really electrify the room into full-on rave all demonstrate the tantalising dynamics of such a small group of people huddled together in a way which wouldn’t feel so strange in a bedroom shared by a sack of hyperactive beatniks slapstick swashbucklers hitting pots and pans and generally making a racket from one dawn to another and succeed in shaking the paper from the walls the skin from the bones like all good oddball pop groups.

The messiah makes what is uncomfortable and absurd consensual and cool connected and clever.

But this poor brainwashed individual this mortal man exposing the core of his being in the form of odd little pop songs with enough sophistication savagery and swagger to flatten thousands someone standing before a packed Manchester leaves the stage retires to behind the wings. But not after essentially slaughtering the audience with a triptych of tunes that turns the nerves inside out.

He walks off with his cult. Downs tools drop sticks and disappears.

But the cocaine man emerges the real prince of tears. Baxter the gangster in a light blue suit. The gambler in the white vest. The cuddly romantic. Baxter the panther. The aloof poet. A leftover lounge singer at a beat bar looks into the beer bottle and hopes it sprouts spotted umbrellas. Longing for a tomorrow not entirely dedicated to the distractions of lethargy and lament. A venting of vendettas. And we’re all your friends Baxter. Manchester loves you too.

Buffett on Saturday reported a sharp decrease in earnings in the third quarter reflecting the turbulent financial markets as well as a slowdown in the U.S. economic recovery with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Profits fell by two-thirds to $10 billion down from $30 billion in the same three months of 2020 when the economy was still in the process of reopening from pandemic shutdowns.

Berkshire’s bottom line was dragged down by its giant investment portfolio which fell 85 percent from a year ago. But profits at Berkshire’s operating businesses which include a railroad as well as a variety of manufacturing and retail businesses that mirror the broader U.S. economy also disappointed. Income there rose just 18 percent from a year ago. That was much less than the 40 percent jump that some analysts has predicted and slower than the 21 percent increase in profits those operating businesses had in the second quarter.

In addition Berkshire recorded nearly $800 million in losses from insurance underwriting as claims from bad weather including Hurricane Ida increased. And while the income from premiums at its popular car brand Geico rose in the quarter its losses from accident claims rose even more as drivers returned to the roads. It also noted that the average claims were higher because of “the increase in the valuation of used vehicles.”

In its railroad business Berkshire said shipping volumes rose 4.4 percent in the third quarter showing the economy’s continued growth. But fuel costs rose nearly 80 percent muting profits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTExLTA2L2J1ZmZldHQtcy1jYXNoLXBpbGUtdG9wcy1yZWNvcmQtd2l0aC0xNDktMi1iaWxsaW9uLW9uLWhhbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buffett's Cash Pile Tops Record With $149.2 Billion On Hand,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. now has a record amount of money to put to work.

Berkshire’s cash pile hit new heights at $149.2 billion of funds in the third quarter surpassing a record set in early 2020 the company said in its earnings report Saturday. The fresh high came even as Buffett poured more money into buying back its own stock with $7.6 billion of repurchases in the period -- the third-highest tally since the board changed its policy on buybacks in 2018."

You can now find all our favorite early Black Friday deals here. : This post is out of date and will not be updated. You can now

Update (11/6/21 9:00 am EDT): For this weekend's Dealmaster roundup we've updated our list of the best offers we can find from the various ""early Black Friday"" sales going on at Amazon Best Buy Target and other retailers this week. We've ensured that the prices of our curated picks are all up to date and we've added a few new offers marked below by the ""NEW"" tag.

Our additions include a joint-lowest price on Amazon's latest Fire HD 10 tablet  which we recommend for those on a budget who want a large-screen tablet for casual media consumption. It's down to $100 . Meanwhile the PS5 and PS4 versions of Hades our 2020 game of the year  are available for a new low of $20 . A couple of HyperX gaming headsets we like the Cloud Alpha and budget-friendly Cloud Stinger  are also down to lower-than-usual prices at $60 and $30  respectively. We also have an all-time low on Apple's high-performing AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones discounts on Amazon's Kindle Unlimited and Music Unlimited services a good price on a well-reviewed Lenovo Chromebook and a new low on an excellent gaming chair from AndaSeat . You can find all these offers along with a refreshed version of our original roundup below.

: With each passing year ""Black Friday"" becomes more and more like ""Black November."" What used to be a single weekend of sales has increasingly stretched out to weeks of breathless promotions. Much to the dismay of the Dealmaster's work-life balance this trend is not stopping any time soon. So right on cue  retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy have already started to roll out so-called ""early Black Friday"" events that promise to offer the same discounts that'll be available at the end of the month.

For today's roundup the Dealmaster has pored through the most recent of these promos to find the discounts that might actually hold true to Black Friday's claims. To be clear we're positive there will be a much wider range of good tech deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday proper than there are in the sales going on as of this writing. The majority of what's out there today is advertising hype (that is even more than usual) and there's still a chance that some of the prices below fall a few bucks lower in the coming weeks. That said the number of genuinely noteworthy sales within these early Black Friday events appear to have picked up since our last roundup.

Among these more recent highlights Amazon has launched its yearly array of discounts on its own Fire tablets Fire TV streamers and Echo smart speakers. The latest Fire HD 8 tablet is down to $45  for instance which is the lowest price we've tracked for consumers who want a competent tablet for basic e-reading and video viewing. Almost all of the Kids editions of these slates— which add protective bumper cases deeper parental controls and a year's subscription to Amazon's Kids+ child-friendly content service—are down to new lows as well. Same goes for the company's newest Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8 smart displays  among others.

Beyond that the best-ever price we saw last month on Sony's excellent (if horrifically named) WH-1000XM4 headphones is back again bringing the versatile noise-canceling headphones back down to $248 . Bose's QuietComfort 35 II meanwhile are available for a low of $179 : they're technically a generation old now  and they charge over the ancient microUSB. But if you want to save $70 and prioritize comfort over all else the QuietComfort 35 II may be worth a look. Sony's true wireless WF-1000XM4 are also down to $248 and are similarly effective at noise cancellation for those who prefer an in-ear design.

Elsewhere we have a sweeping sale on Google's Nest smart home speakers and smart displays deals on well-reviewed LG OLED and TCL Roku TVs lows or near-lows on previously recommended devices like Logitech's G305 wireless gaming mouse SanDisk's Nintendo Switch microSD card  and much more. You can see our full list of recommended deals below; we'll continue sorting through the early Black Friday cruft to find the offers worth your time over the coming weeks.

Is a m1 iPad pro overkill? Might a 2020 pro get her the same stylus experience given the 120hz screen? Could I go down to an air? Or is the stylus experience not as smooth?

Alongside the array of speakers in the Echo range Amazon also offers three different-sized smart displays that build on the Echo smart speakers with a screen that lets you see as well as hear the information being served up by Alexa.

Last year we saw the Echo range discounted by as much as 50% and we anticipate we’ll see similar levels of savings this year - you can get a heads up on all the discounts as they appear in our best Black Friday Amazon Echo deals roundup. However you may now be wondering which of the three is the best smart display for your home.

The Echo Show 5 (2nd generation) which is the smallest of the three is a little too limited for our liking but the Echo Show 8 (2nd generation) which was launched earlier this year and the Echo Show 10 both have plenty to offer including a 13-megapixel camera with pan and zoom capabilities to ensure you’re always in the center of the frame during a video call. We've got all the details on how the two smart displays differ aside from the screen sizes to help you decide which one to go for.

If you are still interested in the Amazon Echo Show 5 find out how it compares to the Echo Show 8 (2nd generation) by reading Amazon Echo Show 8 vs Amazon Echo Show 5 . It's also worth remembering the Amazon Echo Show 8 (1st generation) is still available alongside the latest generation and is also likely to be discounted. However we’ve concentrated on the latest version in this article.

Read on to find out just how these two Echo Shows compare or if you know which Amazon smart display you want check out the best prices right now across the whole of Amazon's smart display range.

Price

The Amazon Echo Show 8 (2nd generation) is priced at $129.99 / £119.99 / AU$199. However we've already seen discounts as part of Amazon's early Black Friday sales which has taken the price down to $99/99 / £89.99 / AU$149. In the US and Australia this brings the smart display back to its record-low price while in the UK we have seen the Echo Show 8 (2nd generation) drop as low as £84.99.

The Amazon Echo Show 10 costs a fair bit more at $249.99 / £239.99 / AU$ 399.99 although it has dropped as low as $199.99 / AU$349.99 in the US and Australia so we anticipate we will see similar savings at some point over the holiday sales period. We also expect to see price drops in the UK as the smart display has yet to be discounted even though it's been available for around 10 months.

Design

There's no denying the Amazon Echo Show 10 and the Amazon Echo Show 8 both have different styling. The rounded design of the Echo Show 10 is a departure from previous models that has a more triangular look. The cylindrical base looks similar to an Echo Studio smart speaker and serves as a stand for that 10.1-inch screen which has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels. There’s also a 13-megapixel front-facing camera for video calls.

Sound comes via a pair of dual 1-inch front-firing tweeters and a 3-inch woofer and there’s a microphone array along the top so Alexa can pick up your voice anywhere in the room.

Meanwhile the small but perfectly formed Amazon Echo Show 8 (2nd generation) is an unobtrusive wee device that can sit happily on the kitchen counter bedside table or on a bookshelf. The wedge-shaped back is covered in a choice of charcoal or sandstone fabric and houses the speakers. The 8-inch display sits at the ideal angle and has the same sharp resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels. It’s a touchscreen device but it’s best used with voice commands.

There are a couple of far-field microphones for interacting with Alexa a pair of 2-inch speakers that get reasonably loud and the same 13-megapixel camera for video calls.

Importantly for the privacy-conscious both smart displays feature a camera cover built-in and also a button on top that allows you to turn the microphone and camera off.

If you plan on watching a lot of videos you’ll likely prefer the 10-inch screen of the Echo Show 10. The resolution is the same which means the smaller Echo Show 8 screen will appear a bit sharper. You’ll notice a difference in the sound quality particularly in the powerfulness of the bass thanks to the Echo Show's 10 built-in woofer.

Features

As we've already mentioned the Amazon Echo Show 10 has a rotating screen which is a big advantage of the larger Echo Show - as it can follow you when you move around the room so it's always in your gaze whether you're following a recipe watching Netflix or making a video call. The angle of the screen can also be manually altered to suit you - not something the Echo Show 8 offers

Both smart displays have a 13-megapixel camera which ensures video calls are sharper and clearer while the camera's ability to pan and zoom automatically to ensure you're always in the center of the frame comes in handy. However we found this was slightly more useful on the Echo Show 10 as the whole screen rotates with you - whereas if you move too far from the Echo Show 8 it can't follow you around the room.

Verdict

Both Echo Show devices are at their best when delivering Amazon content or responding to your queries and commands via Alexa which they do equally well. The choice depends largely on the size you prefer whether a rotating screen will come in useful and the budget you have available.

What is a smart display? Think of it as a tablet and smart speaker in one. You can use them to check the weather watch videos play music control smart home devices and more.

What can a smart display do? Smart displays like Amazon’s Echo Show range have voice assistants built-in so you can ask questions check the weather and keep up to date with your calendar. They can also play music or videos make and take video or audio calls and help you order stuff from Amazon. If you have smart home devices like security cameras you can use your Echo Show to see a live feed or review video alerts. Smart displays can also be used as digital photo frames or alarm clocks.

How do you use a smart display? Smart displays have microphones built-in so they can listen for your commands and questions. With an Echo Show you simply say “Alexa” and then ask away. You can also use the touchscreen to access some functions and apps.

Where can you use smart displays? The only real limitation on placement for a smart display is the need to have a free power outlet you can plug into. Many people like to use them in the kitchen but they can prove useful on the nightstand in the hall or in other rooms around the home."

BLK,BlackRock,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoZW5vbWVuYWx3b3JsZC5vcmcvYW5hbHlzaXMvYmxhY2tyb2NrLWFzc2V0LW1hbmFnZXItY2FwaXRhbGlzbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Titans,"In mid October 2021 when BlackRock revealed its third quarter results the asset management behemoth announced it was just shy of $10 trillion in assets under management. It’s a vast sum “roughly equivalent to the entire global hedge fund private equity and venture capital industries combined” and a nearly ten-fold increase in only a handful of years for a firm that first broke the $1 trillion mark as recently as 2009. Since the 2008 Financial Crisis we’ve witnessed in BlackRock the rise of an undisputed shareholder superpower but the firm while exceptional is not alone. Alongside its closest rival Vanguard these two firms control nearly $20 trillion in assets and a combined market share of more than 50 percent in the booming market for exchange-traded funds (ETFs). And they’re not just big—they’re “universal” controlling major stakes in every firm asset class industry and geography of the global economy. It’s an unprecedented conjuncture of concentration and distribution one which has prompted fierce debate over what this new era of common universal and increasingly passively allocated ownership means. For some the new regime contains the seeds of a socialist-utopian economic vision; for others it’s an anticompetitive “worse than Marxism” nightmare.

At the heart of the debate is the theory of universal ownership which contends that because today’s asset management giants are universal owners with fully diversified portfolios they should be structurally motivated to internalize the negative externalities that arise from the conduct of individual corporations or sectors. Whether social inequality or the climate crisis proponents of universal ownership contend that the enormous externalities of corporate capitalism will eventually diminish shareholder returns and therefore universal owners should and will act to minimize them. It’s an elegant theory but is it true? Ultimately the answer to this question hinges on how we understand ownership.

In their definitive book on corporate governance Robert Monks and Nell Minow the originators of “universal ownership theory” wrote: “It is virtually inconceivable that something would be in the interest of pensioners that is not in the interest of society at large.”

However there are several factors which undermine the promise of universal ownership. Chief among these is the fact that unlike Monks and Minow’s pension funds asset managers are for-profit financial intermediaries investing on behalf of others while retaining the corporate governance rights that derive from share ownership. As the work of legal scholar Lynn Stout has shown corporations are not in fact “owned” by shareholders who instead own rights to income and governance. But even the ownership of shares themselves has become difficult to pinpoint. Should ownership be attributed to households the ultimate beneficiaries of most financial wealth? To the pension funds in which much of this financial wealth is held? Or to the asset managers to whom these pension funds delegate and who dominate today’s shareholder structure?

The answer is not a simple one; indeed the lengthening of the equity investment chain has widened the separation of ownership and control generating the “separation of ownership from ownership.” This separation has significant implications for how we understand the implications of the ascent of today’s asset management titans. By fixating on only one facet of this new landscape—that of universal ownership—we risk overlooking vital aspects of the broader configuration that we call asset manager capitalism.

A regime change

Generations of business students have absorbed the lessons of agency theory according to which shareholders apparently in contrast with managers or workers are uniquely focused on the long-term performance of a corporation. From this perspective what follows is a structure of corporate governance centered on protecting comparatively vulnerable minority shareholders against “expropriation” by insiders—namely majority shareholders managers and workers. As structurally weak stakeholders with skin in the game the theory has it shareholders need strong legal and regulatory protection as well as extraordinary privilege with respect to the corporation’s governance and profits. The legacy of agency theory has been the orientation of Anglo-American business and regulation toward a corporation-dominated economy whose only efficient governance regime is by extension one geared towards maximizing shareholder value.

In the decades since the shareholder value regime took hold of corporate governance inequality has soared investment and growth have stagnated 70 percent of wildlife has vanished and a steady course has been set for a catastrophic 3 degrees of warming. Indeed to state that shareholder value has failed—even on its own efficiency-centered terms—is to state the obvious. But it may now also be to state the irrelevant. In the US and the UK in particular asset manager capitalism is already firmly in place as a distinct corporate governance regime.

Reflecting the periods in which their frameworks were conceived the shareholders that inspired Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means’ Great Depression-era analysis of the separation of ownership and control in the corporation were individual savers; Michael Jensen and William Meckling’s 1970s agency theory expanded this circle to include institutional investors like pension funds and university endowments. These were not-for-profit shareholders with a direct economic interest in the performance of their portfolio companies which they actively selected placing bets on individual companies in pursuit of maximum return. This “Berle-Means-Jensen-Meckling ontology” has been taken for granted by cheerleaders students and critics of the shareholder value regime alike. It was at the heart of Margaret Thatcher’s “shareholder democracy;” of Peter Drucker’s warnings of “pension fund socialism;” and of Peter Hall and David Soskice’s theory of corporate governance in liberal market economies being dominated by “impatient” institutional investors pursuing short-term returns.

The evolution of the shareholder structure in the United States did not however stop with the rise of pension funds. As shown in Figure 1 over the past three decades the key drivers of the re-concentration of share ownership has been the growth of mutual funds and especially of ETFs. Today the largest shareholders are US-based asset management firms—and they bear little relation to the shareholders of the Berle-Means-Jensen-Meckling world. Foremost they are vast. BlackRock and Vanguard alone manage enough in assets to own every corporation in the UK three times over. As a result of their growth the dispersed shareholder structure in liberal market economies—a foundational component of theories of corporate governance and varieties of capitalism—has given way to a reconcentrated shareholder structure. BlackRock and Vanguard now collectively hold 10 percent of the total market capitalization of the FTSE 350 and together with State Street more than 20 percent of the average S&P 500 company. Due to their size these stakes are fundamentally illiquid effectively eliminating “exit”—selling shares—as a source of shareholder power and discipline for the largest asset managers. Moreover the index-tracking funds that make up such a large portion of these giants’ offering cannot (or will not) exit individual firms at will regardless of the size of the stakes—much to the chagrin of pro-divestment groups.

Figure 1: The structure of US corporate equity ownership 1945–2021.

Data: Federal Reserve financial accounts of the United States. Note: All corporate equity is shown including equity issued by US-listed foreign corporations (21% of the total) and closely held equity (15% of the remaining domestic equity).

Though the combined 20 percent stake controlled by the “Big Three” may not at face value seem all that immense it implies an extraordinary influence at corporate annual general meetings (AGMs) during which shareholders vote on resolutions pertaining to everything from director remuneration and retention to emissions targets. Moreover their actual influence is typically measurably higher than this; while asset management firms are required to vote by the SEC in the US for example many smaller investors simply lack the resources or will to participate edging the share monopolized by a small handful of firms even higher. In contrast to the weak shareholders of the agency theory imaginary today’s titanic investment firms are very strong indeed.

Second as a result of both their sheer size and the ever-increasing prominence of index-tracking investment strategies the largest asset managers are fully diversified shareholders. There isn’t a firm in the FTSE 350 or S&P 500 in which BlackRock and Vanguard are not among the largest shareholders and this diversification extends well beyond publicly listed equities from sovereign debt to real estate and private equity.

Together these two hallmarks of asset manager capitalism amount to an alluring promise. As strong and universal shareholders asset managers are structurally incentivized to internalize the negative externalities that were part and parcel of the profit-maximizing calculus of smaller selectively invested shareholders. Rather than seeking to establish the dominance of a particular firm or industry in which an investor has placed her bets universal owners strive for consistent and stable long-term growth—making them uniquely attendant to systemic risks like climate breakdown to which they are universally exposed. Moreover as comparatively strong shareholders larger firms should be capable of and perhaps even entrusted to wield power as forceful stewards of the economy shepherding it toward optimal long-term outcomes. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has emerged as the most vocal cheerleader of this promise. The $10 trillion question: Should we believe him?

To fully gauge the implications of asset manager capitalism we need to consider its third hallmark. Asset managers unlike the pension funds and foundations that dominated before them—are for-profit intermediaries. They are not investing for the sake of returns either short or long term as these pass through them to their ultimate beneficiaries. What motivates the asset manager is the scale of fees they accrue from their clients. Thus the trouble with the rise of the asset manager is not that these investors are particularly short-termist; rather it’s that there is an agency problem. While beneficiaries seek a maximized return asset managers seek higher fee incomes and their corollary: greater assets under management. This agency problem creates a stumbling block for the alluring promise of universal ownership in various ways.

The business model of the asset manager is to manage as much of other people’s money as possible for a fee; and to invest it at as low cost as possible often using index-tracking vehicles. Subpar investment returns impact Vanguard’s economic interests only indirectly if clients move money out of its funds and into alternatives run by BlackRock or State Street. In this respect—that is in the terms that have justified the income and governance rights bestowed upon shareholders—asset managers have little “skin in the game” of corporations’ actions.

There is however one channel through which investment returns directly affect asset managers’ profits: their impact on asset prices. This is because asset managers operate by earning a fee on every dollar they manage. The crux of the arrangement is that assets under management are marked to the market—all things being equal a 20 percent increase of the S&P 500 brings a 20 percent increase in fee income made from S&P 500-indexed funds. In 2020 a stunning increase of asset valuations contributed a $29 billion gross revenue increase to the asset management industry compared to a modest $5 billion from net inflows of new money. For asset managers rising asset prices are the golden goose. Crucially however this is an aggregate preference. Unlike a small investor riding the rollercoaster of Tesla’s share valuation with plenty to lose depending on the outcome BlackRock is comparatively unperturbed by Elon Musk’s errant social media behavior provided that equity prices in aggregate continue to soar. What matters is the performance of the S&P 500 as a whole rather than any of its individual components.

Asset price inflation is not of course just a game asset managers play. In a sense it is the master game of a form of capitalism characterized by what Ben Ansell has called “asset dominance”—a world in which household incomes and political outcomes depend more on trends in real estate and securities markets than on labor market and wage trends. Recent scholarship has shed light on the politics of asset price inflation in areas such as housing and financial regulation and crisis management. We still know relatively little however about the role of the managers of the assets whose value is being inflated.

The politics of asset manager capitalism

What’s good for asset prices is good for asset managers. It is this overriding preference that explains BlackRock’s remarkable dedication to engaging on monetary policy. While Larry Fink’s ambition to sit at the helm of the US Treasury has to date been unsuccessful he has had considerably more success gaining access to and influence over monetary policy including BlackRock’s mandate for allocating the Federal Reserve’s pandemic-response asset purchase program scooping up several of its own ETFs in the process. While the opportunity was welcomed by BlackRock the main prize is the world’s single most important driver of asset valuations—the Fed’s monetary policy stance.

What do a former chairman of the Swiss National Bank a former deputy governor of the Bank of Canada and a former vice-chairman of the Fed have in common? All were hired by BlackRock. In August 2019 this trio managed to secure an invitation to the inner sanctum of the central banking world where they together with BlackRock Investment Initiative colleague Elga Bartsch presented a paper titled “Dealing with the next downturn” at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium. Should there be another crisis the authors argued central banks should respond with audacious monetary easing. A few months later when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the Fed responded with maximum audacity.

What’s wrong with BlackRock lobbying for expansionary monetary policy? The core problem in contrast to the Monks and Minow is that everybody is not a shareholder. To the contrary as shown in Figure 2 half of all directly held stocks and mutual fund shares are held by the richest 1 percent of US households. The bottom half of households has virtually no equity investments at all whether direct or via retirement plans. In this sense a preference for asset price inflation is hardly a departure from the politics of the deflationary coalition sustained as it is by a “cohort of powerful voters whose financial position depends on the continual appreciation of capital assets at the expense of wages.” To be sure tightening labor markets and worker militancy may yet vindicate advocates of asset purchases. For the moment however pandemic response–induced asset price inflation has made the rich richer and BlackRock’s assets and influence even greater.

Figure 2: Equity and mutual fund holdings and holdings of retirement assets (a large share of which is corporate equity) by wealth group 1989–2021. Data: Federal Reserve distributional financial accounts of the United States.

Indeed BlackRock alumni feature in significant roles in the Biden administration. Brian Deese formerly senior advisor to President Obama before becoming Global Head of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock is now chairman of Biden’s National Economic Council. Mike Pyle former BlackRock chief investment strategist has been appointed chief economic advisor to Vice President Harris. BlackRock was also invited to advise on the drafting of the European Union’s sustainable finance regulations which would govern BlackRock’s own investments in the region.

These appointments have significance both in real terms impacting how policy is drafted as well as for understanding the motivations of asset managers more broadly. The shape of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill—after a period of heated contestation—provides a clear distillation of the politics of asset manager capitalism. As Larry Fink stated in his letter to investors “climate risk is investment risk.” BlackRock has been quick to act on this insight. Approaching the crisis both as a universally exposed investor and an institution subject to financial regulation BlackRock has fought hard to ensure that the contested terrain of decarbonization suits their interests.

Though unprecedented in its scale of climate-related investment the bill nonetheless offers a wholly inadequate commitment of public funds to climate and other infrastructural investment instead explicitly leaning on a climate-tailored implementation of Daniela Gabor’s “Wall Street Consensus”—shepherding in private capital on favorable terms backstopped by implicit and explicit government support. It’s an archetypal “socialize risk privatize reward” model for policy handed to eagerly awaiting asset management giants. The asset management titans know that ours is not a world where capital is scarce; investment opportunities are. And for the long-term investor nothing could be more appealing than publicly supported infrastructure investments ideally geared toward resilience to a deteriorating climate. In an economy that must rapidly transform if we are to have any chance of stabilizing the climate ESG as a framework enables investors to bet on the shape of the future economy while marketing themselves as best equipped to mitigate climate risk and in the case of the largest firms to directly participate in legally designating what is and isn’t “ESG.” It has the added benefit of enabling vast firms to distill the votes at thousands of AGMs into tidy manageable decision items.

These are not the motivations of the alpha-seeking exit-prone yet ultimately “weak” minority investors that populated the Jensen-Meckling imaginary. Under asset manager capitalism finance capital is back. The dominant shareholders are vast entities that combine full diversification with significant control. They are in it for the long haul with little liquidity and a fundamental need for aggregate asset price inflation. Staring down the barrel of climate risk they have undertaken a concerted effort to minimize their exposure to that risk while ensuring global efforts to tackle the crisis suit their interests—and the interests of those whose wealth they manage. Could it be that those private interests coincide with the (global) public interest? While a world may exist in which they do the odds seem low that we live in it.

What we do know is that we no longer live in a Berle-Means-Jensen-Meckling world. Beyond having failed (on its own and other terms) the corporate governance regime of shareholder value has had its justifying assumptions utterly upended. The rise of BlackRock Vanguard and their competitors has ushered in a new regime—a combination of concentration control diversification and “disinterestedness” that is without historical precedent. The era of asset manager capitalism constitutes a new corporate governance regime whose implications for power and control in the wider economy we are only beginning to understand.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXRzL3BheXRtLWNhbmFkYS1wZW5zaW9uLWJvZHktYmxhY2tyb2NrLWdldC1saW9ucy1zaGFyZS9hcnRpY2xlMzczNDYyMjguZWNl0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldHMvcGF5dG0tY2FuYWRhLXBlbnNpb24tYm9keS1ibGFja3JvY2stZ2V0LWxpb25zLXNoYXJlL2FydGljbGUzNzM0NjIyOC5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paytm: Canada pension body BlackRock get lion’s share,"BlackRock Global Funds and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) have garnered a bulk of Paytm shares offered through anchor investors’ portion according to NSE data.

Blackrock 3-19

THE SENIOR HURLING kingpins bowed out in Cork this afternoon Blackrock undone by a scoring blitz that Midleton unleashed in the third quarter to settle this semi-final clash.

In possession of a three-point advantage at half-time Midleton cracked home three goals in that spell early in the second half and while they conceded one to Niall Cashman a terrific score by the Cork defender the damage had been done by the East Cork team.

Their 4-16 to 2-13 lead at the midway mark of the second half proved unassailable to ensure Midleton will contest the final for the first time since 2018 and sees title holders Blackrock fall short in their attempts to retain their crown.

Conor Lehane capped a fine display with the last point of the day swelling his total to ten for the day. Cormac Beausang hit 1-4 in a sparkling showing at full-forward while Luke O’Farrell Pa White and Ross O’Regan all raised green flags in that productive third quarter for the team coached by Ben O’Connor.

The first-half was a free-flowing affair characterised by the space both teams created in attack and the volume of scores they registered.

They shared 25 points between them both teams rattled the net and the upshot was Midleton just shaded the exchanges at the break 1-14 to 1-11. That was a product of a strong burst by Ben O’Connor’s charges before the interval as they outscored Blackrock 0-5 to 0-2 after the 23rd minute.

The goals arrived early and in quick succession. Cormac Beausang accelerated in from the left wing and finished off his left side in the 5th minute for Midleton the towering figure of Mark O’Keeffe replied for Blackrock two minutes later a timely boost as things threatened to unravel for the champions as they stared at a five-point deficit.

Blackrock’s best spell came in the first quarter trailing 1-3 to 0-1 after five minutes but in front 1-6 to 1-4 by the 12th minute. Yet Midleton steadied and gradually moved ahead. Conor Lehane amassed 0-6 in the opening period including two exceptional points from play one from either wing. Beausang was always dangerous at full-forward and Tommy O’Connell hit one terrific point from his centre-forward berth.

Then came that third quarter surge from Midleton which powered them towards the finish line. They had a couple of other openings to net late on but Gavin Connolly in the Blackrock goal denied O’Farrell and Beausang while the impressive John O’Sullivan booted home a late goal for Blackrock as they chased the game.

Three goals inside the opening 12 minutes of the second-half propelled Midleton to a first Cork hurling final since 2018 and in the process ended Blackrock’s back-to-back bid.

Ahead by 1-14 to 1-11 at the break Luke O’Farrell Pa White and Ross O’Regan found the net for Midleton on 32 39 and 42 minutes respectively as they took a nine-point lead into the final quarter.

O’Farrell’s goal was the result of a collision between two Blackrock defenders that allowed the former Cork forward steal in. Niall Cashman did respond with a superb individual goal to cut the margin to three 2-16 to 2-13 on 38 minutes.

The gap though quickly moved back out to six as Midleton swept down the field for a Pa White goal. Their third-quarter burst was complete when Ross O’Regan collecting a Cormac Beausang pass drilled home Midleton’s fourth goal of this semi-final.

Their three third-quarter green flags captured the extent to which Midleton ran ragged a Blackrock defence that constantly found themselves a step or two behind their opponents.

The winners time and again located pockets of space in the opposition half of the field into which they sprayed possession and from there took on and more often than not beat the green and gold shirt in close proximity.

Blackrock required goals in the final quarter to keep alive their title defence and while John O’Sullivan did kick to the net on 59 minutes it fell well short of what they required to reel in their opponents. Indeed they had goalkeeper Gavin Connolly to thank for ensuring Midleton’s goal count did not reach five or more.

Fitting it was that Conor Lehane finished the Midleton scoring what was his fourth from play and 10th overall. His catalogue of semi-final scores included an array of sumptuous points from either sideline.

A Midleton spurt late in the first-half - during which the Magpies outscored the 2020 champions by 0-6 to 0-2 between the 21st minute and the call for half-time - contributed to the East Cork men enjoying a 1-14 to 1-11 interval lead.

It was a most open and evenly balanced first half an hour the sides level on six occasions and the lead also changing hands six times.

In the same manner in which they closed out the half Midleton also began this county semi-final in sprightly fashion racing 1-3 to 0-1 clear inside six minutes. Conor Lehane Ross O’Regan and Sam Quirke supplied the points with Cormac Beausang providing the green flag after cutting in from the South Stand sideline.

The Rockies response was that of champions Fergal Ryan’s charges outscoring their opponents 1-5 to 0-1 in the ensuing six minutes to move from five in arrears to one in front.

The Blackrock goal arrived no more than 60 seconds after the Midleton major Mark O’Keeffe set up by Alan Connolly blasting past Brion Saunderson.

Connolly clipped over a pair of frees during this Rockies spell of dominance with Niall Cashman Stephen Murphy and Robbie Cotter also splitting the posts.

It was tit for tat thereafter until three-in-a-row from Beausang Luke O’Farrell and Paul Haugheny nudged Midleton two in front. Michael O’Halloran countered for Blackrock but with three of the half’s final four scores coming from Ger Fitzgerald’s side including a superb Lehane point from the North Stand sideline they led by three turning around for the second period.

It was a lead that grew and grew into the second-half.

Scorers for Midleton: C Lehane (0-10 0-6 frees); C Beausang (1-4); R O’Regan (1-2); L O’Farrell (1-1); P White (1-0); P Haughney (0-2); S O’Leary Hayes T O’Connell S Quirke (0-1 each).

John Fitzpatrick whose daughter Dara and three other crew died in the 2017 crash off the Co Mayo coast was speaking after a report on the incident identified “systemic safety issues”.

Rescue 116 crashed off Co Mayo at 12.46am on March 14 2017 after it struck Blackrock Island 12 miles off the coast.

Captain Dara Fitzpatrick the commander of the flight was pulled from the sea in the hours after the crash but never regained consciousness.

The body of Captain Mark Duffy the co-pilot was taken from the cockpit 12 days later by Navy divers.

The report by the Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) published on Friday found that the crew who were flying in darkness and in poor weather conditions were unaware that the 282ft Blackrock Island was an obstacle on the flight path of their pre-programmed route.

The investigation report found that concerns had been raised over the navigation system – the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) – four years before the crash.

Emails from 2013 highlighted that the lighthouse at Blackrock was not listed in the obstacle database.

Mr Fitzpatrick expressed his shock that the issue was not addressed.

“I’m quite shocked actually by some of the findings” he told RTE Radio One.

He added: “There’s no evidence that was addressed which I think is absolutely crazy. I mean you know these crews that go out and their lives can be endangered and whatever can be done should be done to alleviate that.

“But in this case it wasn’t.”

Mr Fitzpatrick said he was not planning legal action following the report’s publication.

He said the report would help his family move on and he said the inquests which can now proceed would bring “finality”.

The AAIU has published its Final Report into an accident involving a Sikorsky S-92A helicopter EI-ICR ‘Rescue 116’ at Black Rock Co. Mayo on 14 March 2017. The Report includes the Probable Cause 12 Contributory Causes and 42 Safety Recommendations. (1/5) #R116 #Rescue116 pic.twitter.com/PRvXh8xoFj — AAIU IRELAND (@aaiu_ireland) November 5 2021

Asked if he was angry Mr Fitzpatrick said: “Anger really doesn’t get you anywhere I’m sad.”

He added: “She was a good pilot. She did her job well.”

The report found that the crew “probably believed” that the route taken by design “provided adequate terrain separation from obstacles”.

The AAIU made 42 recommendations in light of its findings. The Department of Transport said it fully accepted the report.

The report called on CHC Ireland the company which provided the helicopters to the Irish Coast Guard to review its guidance operating and training procedures in respect of its EGPWS navigating system and to ensure crews “are aware of the limitations”.

CHC Ireland has said it is committed to implementing the appropriate safety recommendations in the report.

The investigation also raised questions over whether the rescue mission was necessary under official protocols.

The National Search and Rescue (SAR) Framework says that such missions are for people “who are or are believed to be in imminent danger of loss of life”.

Reports showed that the fisherman at the centre of the rescue was in danger of losing a thumb but did not appear to be at risk of bleeding out."

Hearing the music elicited the group of Beavers to start singing out loud following their 41-6 playoff win over Oakmont.

“Country roads take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia mountain mama

Take me home country roads.”

After players and coaches finished singing the chorus of John Denver’s “Take Me Home Country Roads” song BVT interim head coach Anthony Landini delivered a simple message to his team.

“Great (expletive) win” he said. “Let’s go!”

Eighth-seeded Blackstone Valley Tech (5-2) now moves on to play No. 1 Stoneham (9-0) in the Round of 8 of the Division 6 playoffs. The Beavers will do so with a household hymn stuck in their brain.

“It was nice to hear. I was kind of at a loss for words” Landini said. “We haven’t heard it for a while. It brought back our 2018 (Super Bowl) run.”

“When that song comes on we know it’s our time” BVT senior captain Trey Howe said.

On Saturday Howe didn’t waste time putting the Beavers on the board. On the first play from scrimmage the 5-foot-8 185-pound running back rushed up the right side untouched for a 70-yard touchdown.

“As soon as I got the ball I saw the hole open up and I hit the jets. That’s all I needed” Howe said. “I could fit a Mack truck through that hole.”

“Right off the bat we came out swinging” BVT senior captain Trout Marnell said.

The Beavers proceeded to get touchdown runs of 22 and 40 yards from senior captain Josh Mateo who is playing with a cast over his broken left hand. The pair of scores secured a 19-0 lead heading into the second quarter.

“He’s a special player” Landini said.

In the second quarter freshman quarterback Alex Burgos added a 1-yard TD run while Howe added a 60-yard touchdown scamper.

Howe finished the game with 11 carries and 225 yards as the second half was all but a formality after the Beavers built a 34-0 lead at the break. The 35-point win marked BVT’s fifth straight victory.

“Right from the start I knew they had no chance” Mateo said.

“We just keep going and going and going” BVT senior captain John Furno said. “It never stops.”

As the clock on the BVT scoreboard reached triple zeroes Mateo sat on the bench and sunk in his final moments of playing on his home field. The four-year varsity player had tears in his eyes.

“Winning my last game on this field means something to me – especially with these guys right here” Mateo said.

After the game Mateo shared emotional hugs with his fellow senior captains. He also shared his main motivation for his final playoff run in high school football.

“We’re doing it for Tony. Always” Mateo said.

Tony Pena a former football player at BVT died Jan. 14 2020 from brain cancer. Mateo has the words “Pena” and “Strong” etched on his purple cleats while Furno has Pena’s picture and No. 54 with “RIP TONY PENA” written on his black cleats.

“Tony’s always with us” Furno said.

“He’s still with us” Mateo said. “Here we are making our run for this team for this field for our family and for our brother Tony.”

In 2018 BVT won a Division 7 Super Bowl title with an 18-0 win over St. Mary’s at Gillette Stadium. That’s when the popular 1971 Denver song was introduced to the team.

So when the father of normal BVT head coach Jim Archibald currently on medical leave played “Take Me Home Country Roads” over the speaker Saturday the joyful bunch of Beavers automatically sang along.

“We couldn’t help but sing it together. It kind of summed up their whole career here at BVT” Landini said. “It puts things in perspective.”

“It means more than just a song for our team” Howe said.

And Blackstone Valley Tech hopes to keep singing that tune all the way to Gillette.

“That’s really the fire that keeps us going every single day” Marnell said. “We want that again.”

This weekend Saturday November 6 and Sunday November 7 2021 the Thunder and Lightning over Tucson Airshow at Davis-Monthan AFB in Arizona will thrill aviation enthusiasts from around the world with a unique mix of aerial and static displays that can only be presented at one of the most unique military aviation installations on earth. But 9 years ago in 2012 at this same Davis-Monthan Airshow there was a very special exhibit that only appeared once and then disappeared forever.

Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson Arizona is adjacent to the famous 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) the famous aircraft “Boneyard” where retired aircraft are stored for use as parts donors or before their demolition for scrap. In addition to being a massive repository for spare aircraft and parts the Boneyard is also a living museum where some of the most fascinating stories in all of aviation sit in quiet repose as their history echoes on into the future long after their demolition.

The Davis-Monthan Airshow is always a special show because of its proximity to unique aviation artifacts and resources like the Boneyard and the Pima Air and Space Museum. But the April 2012 edition of the show was truly exceptional because of one remarkable and ephemeral visitor- a literal “white whale” in aircraft spotting.

The Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser Testbed (formerly Airborne Laser) weapons system aircraft number 00-0001 the only aircraft of its type ever built was on static display at the Davis-Monthan AFB air show this one time in 2012 before its demolition. It was the only time the public ever got a close look at the most expensive aircraft in history.

The YAL-1 was a massive airborne laser weapons system aircraft built on a Boeing 747-400F platform. The fiction-like flying laser cannon was intended to shoot down tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs) and potentially even intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) as part of a theatre and strategic missile defense program that gained momentum during the prior decade in the Reagan administration as a part of the “Star Wars Defense Initiative”.

The program was plagued with complex testing mixed results and stratospheric cost overruns.

﻿

The YAL-1 did however eventually experience testing success when in January 2010 its laser weapon engaged a ballistic missile surrogate simulating a ballistic missile. The test target was called the Missile Alternative Range Target Instrument or “MARTI”. It was “engaged but not destroyed” by the airborne laser fired from the YAL-1 in flight. The program the most expensive military aircraft in history to date was beginning to show promise.

On Feb. 11 2010 the program experienced more success when the YAL-1 engaged two test missile targets with its massive laser-cannon off the California coast in the Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center-Weapons Division Sea Range. During these two tests the YAL-1 shot down a liquid-fueled ballistic missile and then only an hour later “engaged” a solid fuel missile target but did not destroy it because of a “beam misalignment” problem.

An announcement was also made later that eight days prior to these two tests on February 11 the system had actually engaged and destroyed a solid fuel missile in flight. The results from this round of testing achieved all of the program goals during this phase. The February 2010 tests of the YAL-10 Airborne Laser Weapons System marked the first time in history that a directed-energy laser weapon was used to destroy a ballistic missile in flight.

But in December 2011 after $5 billion USD in development and testing the program was cancelled after being deemed “not operationally viable” by Air Force Chief of Staff Norton A. Schwartz and from continued budgetary pressure in Washington.

On February 12 2012 the YAL-1 Airborne Laser Testbed made its final flight to Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson Arizona for internment at the AMARG Boneyard and eventual demolition after usable parts and systems were salvaged.

At the time the YAL-1 arrived at Davis-Monthan in February 2012 I was working at a company on the perimeter of the base and just north of the Pima Air and Space Museum. A friend of mine named Eric and I borrowed a step ladder from work and went over to the fence line at Davis-Monthan to try to get photos of the YAL-1’s arrival but we didn’t time it correctly and to our disappointment missed the aircraft’s arrival before it disappeared into the vast AMARG Boneyard.

Throughout March we stepped up our surveillance of the AMARG fields to see if we could catch a glimpse of the massive but so far elusive YAL-1. Then the week before the Davis-Monthan Airshow my friend Craig arrived at work with reports that the YAL-1 was “on the move” and being towed from the Boneyard back to the main flight line at Davis-Monthan likely for one final and remarkable static display at that coming weekend’s airshow. We were ecstatic. After pressing base insiders for details it was confirmed that the YAL-1 would be a featured static display at the Davis-Monthan Airshow.

I was the very first person in line for admittance into the airshow at Davis-Monthan that morning screened through after a young and capable Air Force Security Policeman scrutinized my camera bag. I made a beeline to the YAL-1 to try to grab some photos before the air show crowds surrounded the aircraft. News had spread all over Tucson that something special was going to be at the air show that weekend.

For a few moments I had the YAL-1 mostly to myself. A few other equally enthusiastic early-bird aviation photographers showed up and we took turns getting shots of the aircraft. There was no one on hand to describe the significance of the aircraft. As the airshow crowds started to file in and crowd around the aircraft one of the other photographers graciously offered to shoot a photo of me under the main landing gear of the YAL-1 and I have that photo as a treasured souvenir of this remarkable day at the Davis-Monthan Airshow. It was a truly unique and remarkable weekend at the Davis-Monthan Airshow and one to never be repeated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2JvZWluZy03MzctbWF4LXRoZS1hY2NpZGVudC1wcm9uZS1wYXNzZW5nZXItcGxhbmUtY2FzZS1lbmRzLXdpdGgtMjI1LW1pbGxpb24tc2V0dGxlbWVudC1yZXBvcnQv0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtdGhlLWFjY2lkZW50LXByb25lLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1wbGFuZS1jYXNlLWVuZHMtd2l0aC0yMjUtbWlsbGlvbi1zZXR0bGVtZW50LXJlcG9ydC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing 737 MAX The Accident-Prone Passenger Plane Case Ends With $225 Million Settlement: Report,"The Boeing 737 Max has been in the news in recent years due to its operational issues. Following a settlement between shareholders and Boeing’s board of directors this plane is once again in the spotlight.

According to Wall Street Journal Boeing’s current and previous directors have secured a $225 million settlement in a shareholder lawsuit alleging that the company’s board of directors failed to adequately manage safety issues involving the 737 MAX.

Insurers will pay the compensation not the board members and executives the Journal said citing people familiar with the agreement. The proposed settlement deal is scheduled to be filed in Delaware Chancery Court in the coming days and it is subject to a judge’s approval.

According to the report Boeing has also promised to appoint a mediator to tackle internal issues and select a board representative with aviation safety knowledge. However this deal does not involve an admission of wrongdoing on the side of the directors including Boeing Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun the report said.

The case which was filed in Delaware Chancery Court claims that the board did not develop any methods to review and monitor aviation safety until after the 737 MAX fleet was grounded after two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019.

A few months back a Delaware judge rejected the company’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit saying that the company’s board of directors must face a shareholder lawsuit over two disastrous 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people. Boeing previously admitted to concealing information about a crucial flight control system at the heart of the two crashes.

Boeing 737 Max

The Boeing 737 MAX is an upgrade from Boeing’s 737 narrow-body commercial planes. It competes with the Airbus A320neo family.

The 737 MAX is based on previous 737 designs but with more fuel-efficient CFM International LEAP-1B engines aerodynamic alterations such as the 737’s signature split-tip winglets and airframe upgrades.

The 737 MAX series comprises different variants with 138 to 204 passengers in a typical two-class configuration and a range of 3215 to 3825 nautical miles (5954 to 7084 km).

The company’s board of directors had approved the 737 MAX development program in August 2011. The first 737 MAX 7 took to the skies in May 2013 while the first MAX 8 was delivered to Malindo Air in May 2017 and it began service on May 22 2017.

However the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) of the 737 MAX had a recurrent failure resulting in two tragic crashes involving a Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 both of which killed 346 people.

From March 2019 to November 2020 Boeing 737 Max was grounded all over the world. Ethiopia and the United States conducted investigations following which they blamed Boeing for the malfunctioning software.

What Went Wrong?

The Lion Air Flight 610 took off from Jakarta on October 29 2018. It abruptly lost altitude went into an uncontrollable dive and fell into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff.

Then on March 10 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 from Nairobi experienced similar issues crashing into the desert around six minutes after taking off.

The reasons for the two crashes were complicated but they were linked mostly to the 737’s MCAS which manages changes in behavior caused by the plane’s larger engines than its predecessors.

The Angle of Attack (AOA) Disagree alert is the feature in question and it was created to notify pilots when two different sensors reported contradicting data. Although the 737 Max has two MCAS only used one. If the AoA sensor fails the MCAS may activate when it shouldn’t causing the nose to drop unnecessarily.

Because of the design there was no automatic switch to the other AoA sensor and MCAS continued to use the incorrect sensor values. This is exactly what happened in both accidents and it was also difficult to override the system.

The Fixes

The Boeing 737 Max is once again in the air and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released a comprehensive description of its conclusion. The MCAS software has been updated to utilize both AoA sensors instead of just one.

When both AoA sensors warn of a likely stall the MCAS now only activates once rather than many times. An “AoA disagree warning” is given to pilots indicating that MCAS may have been activated incorrectly.

At the time of the two tragedies this warning was not standard equipment; airlines had to acquire it as an add-on. Importantly pilots will now be instructed on how to use the MCAS and how to deal with any issues. Pilots reported that they were initially unaware of MCAS’ existence.

However another issue with the 737 Max appears to have surfaced with airlines pulling dozens of MAX jets from service early this year after Boeing issued a warning about a production-related electrical grounding problem in a backup power control unit located in the cockpit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vaGF3YWlpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtYWRkcy1iaWdnZXItYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3MtY2FiaW4tNzg3LWFpcmNyYWZ0LTIwMjEtMTHSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2hhd2FpaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFkZHMtYmlnZ2VyLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLWNhYmluLTc4Ny1haXJjcmFmdC0yMDIxLTExP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaiian Airlines adds bigger business class cabin to 787 aircraft,"""It's [the Boeing 787] going to be an aircraft we fly long-haul to premium dense markets"" COO Jon Snook told Skift.

Boeing Co. current and former company directors have reached a $237.5 million proposed settlement with shareholders to settle a lawsuit over the safety oversight of the 737 MAX aircraft documents seen by Reuters show.

Following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in the space of five months in 2018-19 that killed 346 people Boeing's best selling plane was grounded for 20 months and returned to service after the company made significant software and training improvements.

The proposed agreement which is being filed in Delaware Chancery Court late on November 5 and was confirmed by Boeing will require the election of an additional board director with aviation/aerospace engineering or product safety oversight expertise within one year.

Boeing's board would always be required to have at least three directors with safety-related experience according to the proposal which must be approved by a judge to become final.

Under the settlement Boeing would amend its bylaws to require the separation of the CEO and Board chair positions create for at least five years an ombudsperson program to provide Boeing employees conducting airplane certification work for the Federal Aviation Administration with a way to raise work-related concerns.

The settlement would also require Boeing to provide annual public reports on safety related enhancements implemented by the planemaker since the MAX air disasters.

The financial penalty is to be paid by insurers to Boeing the documents show minus up to $29.7 million in legal fees and expenses to the shareholder attorneys.

Under the settlement Boeing's current and former directors do not admit wrongdoing and assert they were acting in what they believed was in the best interests of Boeing and its stockholders.

The Delaware court in September ruled Boeing stockholders could pursue some claims against the board saying the first 737 MAX crash was a ""red flag"" about a safety system known as MCAS ""that the board should have heeded but instead ignored.""

The crashes have cost Boeing some $20 billion. Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice in January including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes.

Boeing confirmed the settlement and said ""Boeing has taken significant actions to reinforce and strengthen our commitment to aviation safety"" since the crashes.

The settlement it added ""builds on those actions with additional oversight and governance reforms that will further advance safety and quality in the work that we do.""

This week it’s a two-for-one with a British Airways Airbus A321 taking off and a Cathay Pacific Boeing 777-300ER taxiing at London Heathrow Airport.

British Airways utilises the Airbus A321 on short to medium-haul operations serving alongside the Airbus A319 Airbus A320 Airbus A320neo and Airbus A321neo. Meanwhile Cathay Pacific operates the Airbus A330-300 Airbus A350-900 Airbus A350-1000 and Boeing 777-300 its medium to long haul operation.

Both are members of the Oneworld Alliance.

The Cathay Pacific Boeing 777-300ER – B-KPJ is currently stored with the aircraft going into storage in September 2020. It joined the Cathay Pacific fleet in January 2009 was leased to the airline. The aircraft has not returned to service since stored.

As for the British Airways A321 sadly this could not be identified from the photos I have of it.

Some Good News but More Work Needed,"Sirolimus and biolimus have potential but their ultimate standing in comparison to paclitaxel is unclear at best experts say.

Three presentations at TCT 2021 show the promise for use of drug-coated balloons (DCB) in coronary arteries ranging from the treatment of new lesions to in-stent restenosis and small coronaries. At the same time it’s clear that caution is warranted around the choice of drug the durability and the significance of late lumen enlargement.

While European interventionalists have had DCB-based technology in their toolboxes for years the United States has no fully approved dedicated DCBs for coronary use. A few devices including Selution SLR (MedAlliance) SeQuent Please ReX (B. Braun) Virtue (Orchestra BioMed) Agent DCB (Boston Scientific) and Magic Touch (Concept Medical) have been granted breakthrough device designation (allowing for fast-tracked review) by the US Food and Drug Administration.

“As US interventionalists we are all clawing and begging for drug-coated balloons but we want them to be safe and we want them to be effective” Roxana Mehran MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY) told TCTMD. “The safety and efficacy data on the coronary side with what we saw evaluated today is absolutely not there for what FDA needs.”

Mehran who moderated a press conference prior to the three presentations said late lumen loss and mechanistic data are fine but long-term outcomes are what is really needed to move the needle forward if coronary DCBs are going to be a real option for American interventionalists. Despite their availability in Europe she said “we're not seeing sponsors working to show safety and efficacy data in larger numbers of patients like we have done with stenting.”

Paclitaxel is the standard for most of the coronary DCBs in Europe. That adds another layer of problems due to the issues raised in a 2018 meta-analysis over a potential mortality signal with paclitaxel-based DCBs and stents in peripheral interventions.

“I think the controversy has made everyone stop and think and obviously it's slowed the [research] process a little” Mehran noted. “But at the same time it's opened doors for other technologies like sirolimus and biolimus.”

Pushing Forward With Alternative Drugs

In the first RCT presented by Wan Azman Wan Ahmad MD (University Malaya Medical Center Kuala Lumpur) the sirolimus-coated SeQuent SCB (B. Braun) was compared against the paclitaxel-coated SeQuent Please Neo (B. Braun) in 70 patients with coronary de novo lesions who were treated at one of six centers in Malaysia.

The primary endpoint of late lumen loss at 6 months was 0.10 ± 0.32 mm in the sirolimus group and 0.01 ± 0.33 mm in the paclitaxel group. However late lumen enlargement at 6 months occurred more commonly in lesions treated with paclitaxel than with sirolimus (58% vs 32%; P = 0.019).

Although not powered for clinical outcomes at 12-month follow-up there was no difference between treatment groups in terms of TLR stent thrombosis death target-vessel MI unscheduled angiography or MACE (cardiac death target-vessel MI or clinically driven TLR).

Asked by TCTMD if he thought the late lumen enlargement was a true difference related to sirolimus a play of chance or something else Wan Ahmad said he believes the finding is significant and requires more investigation as to why it occurred.

“I do think this is a key question” added Mehran. “Is it real? Is sirolimus better than paclitaxel or vice versa and does it matter?”

Commenting in the press conference Luigi Salemme MD (Montevergine Clinic Naples Italy) said one thing that is clear is that paclitaxel and sirolimus DCB comparisons can’t be viewed in the same light as comparisons of paclitaxel and sirolimus stents. “We need more data of course we need to treat more lesions and we have to consider different lesions” he noted.

Small Vessels and In-Stent Restenosis

Next up the first-in-human BIO-RISE CHINA study showed that a biolimus-coated balloon was superior to plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) in patients with small-vessel CAD for the primary endpoint of in-segment late lumen loss at 9 months. This study also was not powered for clinical outcomes.

Presenter Kai Xu MD (General Hospital of Northern Theater Command Liaoning China) showed that late lumen loss was 0.17 ± 0.32 mm in the biolimus group and 0.29 ± 0.35 mm in the POBA group (P = 0.0034). As for late lumen enlargement the rate was three times higher with biolimus than POBA at 29.7% vs 9.7% (P = 0.0007).

While Salemme said any comparisons with POBA are “useless” because of the proven efficacy of available DCBs Mehran said it was important for the investigators to show safety and efficacy with the novel biolimus agent “especially given everything that we've been through with paclitaxel.”

In the third presentation Bruno Scheller MD (Saarland University Homburg/Saar Germany) presented data from two RCTs of DCBs for in-stent restenosis: FIM Malaysian and German-Swiss which compared the same DCBs as the trial from Wan Ahmad. The FIM Malaysian and German-Swiss RCTs were conducted in parallel using an identical study protocol.

For the primary noninferiority endpoint of angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months both groups were similar with the same in-lesion rate of 0.30 mm (difference 0; 95% CI -0.24-0.24; threshold < 0.35). Similarly in-segment late lumen loss was 0.26 mm for sirolimus and 0.25 mm for paclitaxel (difference -0.01; 95% CI -0.24-0.23; threshold < 0.35). This trial also was not powered to detect clinical differences.

Scheller concluded that for now paclitaxel DCBs remain the standard of choice for in-stent restenosis lesions.

Following the presentations session moderator Juan F. Granada MD (Cardiovascular Research Foundation New York NY) said one overriding concern with sirolimus use in coronary interventions is the durability of its effect. “You can find paclitaxel in the artery for a long time but sirolimus goes away very quickly” he said adding that potential late catch-up concerns can’t be overlooked.

“That's one of the unanswered questions [and] that that's my concern too” Scheller added. “The studies we have seen today are very promising” he said adding that follow-up is too short to address issues such as late catch-up.

“I congratulate the investigators for pushing this field forward because there are still some issues with drug-eluting stents” said panelist Wayne Batchelor MD (Inova Heart & Vascular Institute Falls Church VA). “They're very predictable we've got excellent results but when you look at very late stent thrombosis and neoatherosclerosis there are some limitations. Furthermore in young patients especially treating long segments of the LAD I'm always concerned about that ‘full metal jacket’ that compromises the ability for surgical conduits later. So I think the field should be pushed forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vdGNibWFnLmNvbS9mcm9tLWJyaW5rLW9mLWNvbGxhcHNlLXRvLWlwby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Brink of Collapse to IPO,"Nadim Yared didn’t found CVRx Inc. the Brooklyn Park-based medical device company where he has served as president and CEO since 2006. He’s not a doctor; he’s an engineer. When he joined the company it was focused on developing a device to treat high blood pressure and later hypertension but those ideas have long since been thrown out the window.

But Yared has been a steady pilot for the company along the way. Its signature product is Barostim Neo an implantable device that uses neuromodulation to treat heart disease. When it was still private it raised approximately $400 million in equity and debt more than most other Minnesota startups.

Before joining CVRx Yared worked for Medtronic and GE Healthcare two of the largest players in the industry. He brings a global perspective to business. A native of Lebanon he grew up there during the nation’s civil war in the 1970s and ‘80s. He earned his engineering degree in France. And he speaks three languages: Arabic French and English.

In 2018 the company was on the brink of shutting down after disappointing clinical trial results. Yared and other company leaders didn’t see any other option at the time. While the company often drew headlines for its prolific fundraising the story of the company’s near-collapse is not well known.

“We had three plans: plans A B and C. All three plans were shutdown plans” recalls Yared.

Instead the company unexpectedly went with Plan D: It survived. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration received new clinical trial data on May 1 2019 and granted approval to the Barostim Neo System on Aug. 16. “The data basically spoke for itself” says Yared. The company went public in late June netting approximately $133.3 million in proceeds.

Looking back at the company’s long road to get where it is today Yared says “Medical discovery is not always a straight line.”

When the company pivoted from hypertension to heart disease did that concern your investors?

One of the things I learned is the importance in selecting the right investors in the company from the get-go. I think that’s the most important thing. The importance of the investors is often ignored. That money that you raise from the Series A or the seed money will influence the life of the company forever.

We were blessed at CVRx in having very solid investors. New Enterprise Associates [NEA] is a large venture fund and they actually invested in the incubator that started CVRx and led or co-led every single round of financing since the inception of the company over two decades.

In 2007 we added Johnson & Johnson Innovation—that’s the venture arm of J&J—to become an investor and they also were very solid backers of the company. They also led or co-led every single round of investment with NEA since 2007.

When we made that decision—which road do we take hypertension or heart failure?—the company was already well funded. In 2008 we raised $84 million and in 2007 we raised $65 million. By 2011 we still had a solid balance sheet.

Have you received any good advice that helped you run the company?

One of my board members early on was Dale Spencer. Dale is a legend in the cardiovascular space. He created SciMed [which] was sold to Boston Scientific. He was on the board of CVRx for many many years. He guided me along the way.

Plus John Nehra from NEA early on. He’s still on our board; he is our lead director. Those two influenced me a lot early on as a young CEO running CVRx.

What guidance did they offer?

Let me take the example of John Nehra. One of the [pieces] of advice he gave me early on as an entrepreneur is to raise the money when I don’t need it. When you need the money you go to raise it and you’re desperate. The investors know that. That’s a bad situation.

Plus the money goes through cycles. Sometimes there’s a lot of money sitting on the sidelines; sometimes there is not. That cycle could be very different than the cycle of your company whether you need the funding or not. Many CEOs worry about the dilution effect of raising money when you don’t need it. “What if I don’t need this money? Why would I raise it now?”

John Nehra’s advice for me was “Take the money when it’s available not when you need it.” That has helped and saved the company over the years multiple times. Not once or twice—multiple times.

How did that work for the company?

We had just raised the money in late 2007 from J&J—$65 million. In 2008 we had not yet started spending this money. We were still spending the money raised prior to that. Somebody knocked on our door and said “I would like to invest in CVRx.”

We still had $65 million that we had not spent. At the end of this exercise we end up raising $84 million closing that round in July 2008. In Minneapolis I was labeled as the “stupid CEO” who washes out and devalues everybody. August 2008: economic crisis. September 2008 everybody wanted me on a panel to talk about how smart I was to raise money in July when I did not need it.

In October 2008 it would have been impossible to raise the money.

Totally.

How about advice that you haven’t followed?

I got some bad advice over the years. The bad advice was “Never ask the FDA any questions because you may get the answer you don’t like.” That’s one of the worst [pieces] of advice I received over the years.

Not only ask the FDA but go and share your business plan with the FDA. Tell them where you’re strong tell them where you’re weak tell them your challenges tell them the constraints around which you are working because they will try to understand how the choices they are making on their end could make the difference between day and night for you as a CEO of the company.

By all means: Ask FDA ask FDA and ask FDA. If you don’t like the answer ask them again.

Was doing an IPO for the company always the plan?

It was always one of the plans for the company for sure because funding from private funds will become limited over time. There’s a finite amount of [venture fund] money available … for small companies medtech companies. And after a while you start building a commercial organization that requires a lot of funds. It’s harder and harder to do this from private funds.

Do you find Minnesotans wary of becoming investors?

I’ve seen many entrepreneurs based in Minnesota struggling much more than entrepreneurs based in the Bay Area and Boston. On one hand I look at it favorably that we’re able to raise money from outside of Minnesota to be invested mostly in Minnesota. But if you want the medtech industry to stay vital in Minnesota we need to have a stronger VC community in Minnesota—no question about it.

What is the hardest thing about being a startup CEO?

The hardest thing is always to say no. Your crew comes up with so many ideas yet your resources are so limited. You have to stay focused on what you can do.

That’s probably the hardest thing. Now along the way you will face some really gut-wrenching moments. Letting people go because you’re running out of money is very hard. But I think the hardest is still saying no because you are faced with that decision every single day.

It sounds like you’ve seen some challenges.

In the fall of 2018 we thought that we failed our clinical trial. We thought “This is it. This is the end of CVRx.” [We made] a decision to reduce our cash burn to be able to survive for a little longer to understand what was going on and we laid off about two-thirds of the company.

We also had to communicate to physicians and patients in the trial that the trial was unlikely to meet its end point. As a CEO I have a friend of mine that I just fired. … I have investors who trusted us and I’m telling them “Hey this is not working.” That is difficult but those situations happen maybe once in a lifetime.

As CEO you feel lonely and insufficient when this happens. You feel like an entire world is against you between the regulators and the customers and patients and employees and investors. And you’re trying to keep the lights on despite all of it.

Obviously you didn’t go out of business. What happened?

In 2018 … in the data there was one end point that was not going correctly so it was basically neutral not statistically significant. The FDA I informed them that this is basically a failure in the trial and we don’t have a choice other than shutting down the company.

To their credit the leadership of the FDA asked us to not rush. They said that they’ve seen situations like this in the past and there are ways that we could recover from it. That recovery was difficult because we had to figure out a way to do it without wasting too much time.

Luckily for us we had the second cohort of patients that was reaching maturity in six months that we could use as a second trial basically. That second set of data in April 2019 was very very good and that led to a very fast approval of our product in three and a half months.

How did you find the process of the IPO?

The process of going through an IPO is long and exciting and at the same time tiring. It goes from the due diligence working with a couple of law firms four banks and so forth to doing investor meetings day after day after day … it’s not easy.

It’s very exciting to see how many people are interested in our story and in the product and the company that we’ve built. I was actually happy with the process. Now we’ve raised the funds that we need to continue building the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYWNhZGVtaWMub3VwLmNvbS9laGpjci9hcnRpY2xlLzUvMTEveXRhYjM4NC82NDIyNTM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intravascular ultrasound-guided drug-coated balloon venoplasty for in-stent restenosis in pulmonary veins stenosis: a ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://academic.oup.com/ehjcr/article/5/11/ytab384/6422538 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYWNhZGVtaWMub3VwLmNvbS9laGpjci9hcnRpY2xlLzUvMTEveXRhYjM4NC82NDIyNTM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2RhbGUtdmVybm9uLW5vdGFibGUtd2VhbHRoLW1hbmFnZXJzLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dale Vernon Notable Wealth Managers 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainscleveland.com/awards/dale-vernon-notable-wealth-managers-2021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2RhbGUtdmVybm9uLW5vdGFibGUtd2VhbHRoLW1hbmFnZXJzLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtdWxldC1sYWEtY2xvc3VyZS1kZXZpY2UtaGFzLWZld2VyLWxlYWtzLXdhdGNobWFuLWRvZXMtaXQtbWF0dGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amulet LAA Closure Device Has Fewer Leaks Than Watchman: Does It Matter?,"(UPDATED) The clinical relevance of the difference in peridevice leaks between devices remains unknown experts say.

ORLANDO FL—(UPDATED) The Amplatzer Amulet device (Abbott) seals off the left atrial appendage (LAA) better than the Watchman 2.5 or Watchman FLX devices (Boston Scientific) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at risk for stroke studies indicate but it’s not clear that the difference in peridevice leaks has clinical consequences.

Compared with the first-generation Watchman 2.5 the Amulet resulted in fewer leaks ≥ 3 mm through 12 months according to additional data from the AMULET IDE trial which is consistent with the initial 45-day results Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy MD (Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute and Research Foundation Overland Park KS) reported here at TCT 2021.

And the smaller SWISS-APERO trial presented by Roberto Galea MD (Bern University Hospital Switzerland) showed that even though there was no difference in residual LAA patency by cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) between the Amulet and the Watchman 2.5/FLX devices at 45 days there were fewer transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-measured leaks with the Amulet. The findings were published simultaneously online in Circulation.

Experts agreed that it’s better to have no leaks after LAA closure—the purpose of the procedure after all is to prevent thrombus in the appendage from entering the circulation and causing stroke—but whether the issue carries any relevance in terms of adverse outcomes down the line remains unknown. Of note clinical outcomes did not differ based on device choice in either trial.

“Are these leaks clinically relevant or not? In my mind every leak is an issue because you’re closing the appendage and you don’t want a leak” Luigi Di Biase MD PhD (Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Montefiore Hospital Bronx NY) a member of the American College of Cardiology’s Electrophysiology Council commented to TCTMD. “But the data about the clinical importance of these leaks still needs to be investigated in a big trial and we don’t know what is the role of the leak at 45 days versus 12 months versus more than 12 months.”

AMULET IDE

The AMULET IDE trial randomized 1878 patients with AF who were at high risk for stroke/systemic embolism to LAA occlusion using either the Amplatzer Amulet device or the Watchman 2.5. The primary results of the AMULET IDE trial which supported US Food and Drug Administration approval of the Amulet device in August show that all three primary endpoints assessing the completeness of the seal at 45 days safety at 12 months and effectiveness in terms of rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 18 months were met with superiority of the Amulet device established for closure at 45 days.

The clinical importance of these leaks still needs to be investigated in a big trial. Luigi Di Biase

At TCT 2021 Lakkireddy reported on closure based on follow-up TEEs performed at 1 year. Between 45 days and 1 year he noted there was fluctuation of leaks with improvement in some and worsening in others.

Even so the superiority of the Amulet in terms of the percentage of patients with moderate peridevice leaks (≥ 3 mm) seen at 45 days (11% vs 26% with the Watchman 2.5) was maintained at 1 year (9% vs 22%; P < 0.001 for both).

Of patients who had moderate leaks at 45 days those treated with the Amulet versus the Watchman 2.5 were less likely to still have leaks of that size at 1 year (39% vs 46%).

“The dual-seal Amplatzer Amulet left atrial appendage closure device demonstrated durably superior closure at 12 months compared to the single-occlusive mechanism Watchman 2.5 device” Lakkireddy concluded during his presentation. The clinical impact of the leaks will be assessed over longer-term follow-up in the trial which is set to check in on patients through 5 years he noted.

SWISS-APERO

Galea said the SWISS-APERO trial conducted at eight sites across four European countries is the first to compare the Amulet device with the new-generation Watchman FLX in terms of residual LAA patency according CCTA at 45 days. The trial randomized 221 patients (mean age 77 years; 71% men) who had high bleeding risk LAA morphology suitable for either device and no LAA thrombus. In the Watchman arm 22.7% of patients received the first-generation device and the rest received the Watchman FLX.

Major procedure-related complications were more frequent with the Amulet (9.0% vs 2.7%; P = 0.047) driven by a higher rate of BARC type 3-5 bleeding (7.2% vs 1.8%). There were two cases of device embolization one in each group. Two patients died both in the Amulet arm—one was related to an air embolism resulting in ischemic stroke and CV death and the other was due to a clinically relevant pericardial effusion treated by pericardiocentesis.

Galea noted that the complication rate was higher in SWISS-APERO than in previous studies of the Amulet device. In the AMULET IDE trial for instance the rate of procedure-related complications was 4.5% in the Amulet arm (versus 2.5% in the Watchman 2.5 arm). He pointed out however that the SWISS-APERO trial used a more-inclusive definition of procedural complications that incorporated related events that occurred beyond 7 days as well as minor and nonclinically relevant events. In addition patient characteristics indicated a higher-risk population in SWISS-APERO versus AMULET IDE.

The primary endpoint was a composite of justified crossover to the other device during the procedure and CCTA-assessed residual LAA patency at 45 days. There was only one crossover—in a patient initially randomized to the Amulet device—so rates of the endpoint reflect residual LAA patency. There was no difference between the Amulet and Watchman groups (67.6% vs 70.0%; risk ratio 0.97; 95% CI 0.80-1.16). The finding was consistent across various subgroups and did not differ based on the generation of Watchman device used.

The distribution of the types of LAA patency differed between devices. The Amulet was associated with a higher proportion of intradevice leaks through the device lobe (44.8% vs 23.0%; P = 0.001) whereas the Watchman was linked to more mixed leaks when movement of contrast is visible along part of the device lobe (14.0% vs 3.8%; P = 0.01) and patency with no visible leaks (21.0% vs 9.5%; P = 0.022).

We should try to investigate further to know how concerned we ought to be and we want to make sure that it’s addressed prior to . . . just spreading this out more broadly to indiscriminate numbers of patients who we may or may not be helping. Ajay Kirtane

In terms of peridevice leaks on TEE at 45 days a secondary endpoint the rate was lower in the Amulet arm (13.7% vs 27.5%; P = 0.02). There were no leaks greater than 5 mm in either group and only two patients with multiple leaks (both with Watchman 2.5).

Rates of device-related thrombus detected by CCTA or TEE at 45 days were low and did not differ between groups. There were no between-group differences in clinical outcomes at 45 days although the trial was not powered for this purpose. The rate of a composite of CV death stroke or systemic embolism was 2.7% in the Amulet arm and 4.5% in the Watchman arm (P = 0.463).

“The clinical relevance of the residual LAA patency at 45 days still [remains] not entirely understood” Galea said at a media briefing. He noted however that there is accumulating evidence from retrospective studies—including one published earlier this year—that suggests residual patency is associated with higher rates of thromboembolic events. “We cannot of course draw any conclusion [from] these retrospective studies but I think that it’s still a target for . . . operators to complete the LAA sealing after the procedure.”

Aiming for Zero Leaks

In a discussion with reporters physicians addressed the issue of leaks after LAA closure even as the field awaits more-definitive data on the potential link to adverse clinical outcomes.

“We should try to investigate further to know how concerned we ought to be and we want to make sure that it’s addressed prior to . . . just spreading this out more broadly to indiscriminate numbers of patients who we may or may not be helping” Ajay Kirtane MD (NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center NY) commented.

Ultimately Ruby Satpathy MD (Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville FL) said the goal should be no leaks “and most of the time it is zero. . . . As we evolve this technology as we’re getting into the new-generation devices and also better preop understanding and intraop imaging our goal is to go to zero because a lot of times we can tweak that appendage closure device whichever you are choosing just a little bit recapture it and redeploy it and actually have zero leak.”

In other words she emphasized “you can go from acceptable to optimal and I think that responsibility lies in us.”

To TCTMD Di Biase said the more-important point to take away when discussing differences between LAA closure devices is that it’s good for operators to have different options to consider. LAAs come in various shapes and sizes so it’s helpful to be able to tailor the device to a specific patient. “The more devices we have the more selection we have the more we can suit them for our patients” Di Biase said.

Thus both the Amulet and the Watchman FLX device “have a very important role to play” he said noting he expects to see the procedural complication rate with the Amulet to come down over time much like it did for the Watchman 2.5.

Speaking with reporters Mintu Turakhia MD (Stanford University School of Medicine and VA Palo Alto Health Care System CA) underscored the importance of keeping an eye on these safety issues. And broadening the scope of the discussion beyond LAA occlusion devices he said that “we don’t . . . have a proper randomized trial against the alternative therapy which is a direct oral anticoagulant for any of these. And when you look at these safety events and death it’s something you need to consider if that would happen in patients on a direct oral anticoagulant because the eligibility [for LAA occlusion] nowadays is not a hard contraindication to oral anticoagulation.”"

Her coworker has confessed to the killing,"Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was shot and killed in Tennessee last month and a coworker has reportedly confessed to the crime.

Police in Memphis say Brown was murdered in the early morning hours of April 19 after she finished her work shift at Checkers a drive-thru fast-food establishment according to local CBS affiliate WREG. She was seen on video driving away in her Pontiac G3 with coworker Alexander Williamson 20 just after 2:30 a.m. Brown’s body was discovered in her car several hours later in a wooded area on Rolling Woods Drive. She suffered a single gunshot wound to her left side.

On April 28 Williamson voluntarily walked into a police station and confessed to the crime local Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV reported. He reportedly gave a full confession but police provided no information about a possible motive or why he decided to confess.

Alexander Williamson Shelby County Sheriff's Office

Brown is the 11th known trans individual to die violently this year and the second known Black trans woman to be killed according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of WeCare Tennesse which supports trans women of color in the state decried violence against Black trans women and called for greater efforts on behalf of the trans community.

“It saddens me that we are living in a time where black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” Tasaki said in a statement. “Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on. It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

Brown was a victim of violence last year when shot while waiting for an Uber after work on October 18. She was accosted by two men around 3 a.m. She was able to use mace on the man with a gun but he wiped his face and shot her in the leg. She later told local ABC affiliate WATN-TV she felt lucky that the man didn’t shoot her in the back as she fled.

This is not the first time Williamson has been charged with murder. He was arrested in 2022 along with his brothers Artavious 23 and Ajaylin. 22 for the shooting death of a man who had been in an earlier dispute with Artvavious. He reportedly returned with his brothers to the man’s Memphis home where he shot and killed him after challenging him to a fist fight WHBQ-TV reported at the time. Williamson then 19 was charged with second-degree murder."

So who’s buying?,"At least two Las Vegas gaming giants — MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment — are currently shopping Strip resorts. The big question is who’s going to end up buying them.

Vegas has no NBA team (yet) but can it support 2 arena projects?

The Mirage on the Strip seen in May 2021. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae

You won’t see their listings pop up on Zillow but at least two Las Vegas gaming giants are currently shopping Strip resorts.

MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle made a somewhat surprising announcement this past week on a quarterly earnings call that the company is in the “early stages” of selling The Mirage. A day earlier Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said that the company is planning to sell one of its Strip resorts sometime in early 2022.

We won’t know for sure until things crystalize over the next several months or longer but the attention now turns to the pool of potential buyers. Hornbuckle didn’t name a price tag for The Mirage or possible buyers and Reeg has yet to say publicly which property or properties Caesars is looking to offload.

Barry Jonas an analyst with Truist Securities said Friday that there are a “number of regional commercial and tribal players who could make sense to expand to the Strip to scale up their operations and drive cross-property synergies.”

Some such groups have already publicly expressed their interest in grabbing a spot along the iconic corridor.

Speaking to members of the press in Las Vegas last month at the Global Gaming Expo Seminole Gaming CEO and Hard Rock Entertainment Chairman Jim Allen was upfront that the group is eyeing options in town.

“We recognize that Las Vegas is the capital of gaming in the United States” Allen said. “If that opportunity comes up then yes we would be interested.”

If they’re interested in The Mirage the group isn’t saying. A spokesperson for Seminole Gaming said in an email this past week that the company has “no updates to share at this time.”

Alan Feldman a distinguished fellow at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute said that Hard Rock “would be very near if not at the top of the list” of potential new operators for The Mirage. But there are plenty of other viable candidates he added including regional casino operators based in other markets that could be looking for a foothold on the Strip.

“Having The Mirage as your marquee property could be very exciting because now you have customers in regional markets accumulating loyalty points and an absolutely iconic property in Las Vegas to use those points” he said.

Penn National Gaming President CEO and Director Jay Snowden had similar comments when asked about The Mirage on the company’s earnings call on Thursday saying “If we were to find the right asset at the right location at the right price of course we’d be interested.”

Penn is in the process of selling its lone Strip hotel-casino — the Tropicana — to Bally’s Corp. for $308 million. The company also tried but failed to buy The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas losing out to MGM’s $1.6 billion bid to acquire its operations. But Snowden said he doesn’t feel the need to chase any property just to get onto Las Vegas Boulevard.

“It would be great to have an asset that we could create some retention value when (customers are) in Vegas” Snowden said. “But we don’t think that such a strategic imperative that we would chase an asset or overpay.”

Diversification

Combined Caesars and MGM currently operate more than half of the casinos that sit on the Strip. MGM is in the process of adding another having agreed in September to buy the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in a deal expected to close next year.

Both companies moving to sell off one of their properties will be good for the livelihood of the Strip said Chris Grove an analyst with California-based Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.

“Competition drives innovation and innovation is critical to the Strip continuing to earn its historical reputation as a one-of-a-kind destination” Grove said. “The Strip has always relied on cycles of new ownership that build something fresh and intriguing on top of the firm foundation provided by the experiences of the past. It feels like we’re due to enter one of those cycles. “

History

Feldman the UNLV fellow knows The Mirage as well as anyone.

He moved to Las Vegas in 1989 for the opening of the resort as an outside public affairs adviser. He spent 11 years with the-then Mirage Resorts and another 18 with MGM Resorts after MGM merged with Mirage in 2000.

With its focus on luxury and world-class features The Mirage helped change the face of Las Vegas by ushering Las Vegas into a new era dominated by integrated resorts that went far beyond the casino floor and helping cement the blueprint that every other company would soon follow.

And it caught the attention of Wall Street like never before Feldman said. Even though the resort was built using so-called junk bonds the resort paid them off faster than most and replaced them with low-interest mainstream loans.

“What followed The Mirage was billions and billions of dollars of investments in Las Vegas” Feldman said. “Had The Mirage not succeeded that never would have happened.”

While the resort is now more than three decades old it still has outstanding value to potential buyers Feldman said.

It sits on 77 acres right in the center stretch of the Strip with plenty of unused space where new attractions or buildings could be built. The resort has been remodeled and upgraded multiple times helping hide its age.

“As it is it’s thriving” Feldman said. “But with some renewed energy and a new point-of-view you could do even more.”

ANDERSON Ind. (AP) — Caesars Entertainment is moving ahead with expansion plans at its second horse track casino in central Indiana that will add space for more slot machines and a new restaurant.

An Anderson zoning board this past week approved the estimated $34 million project for Harrah's Hoosier Park. The company plans a 38000 square-foot expansion that will result in 100 more slot machines along with restaurant and bar space and a new drive-through area for valet parking The Herald Bulletin reported.

Groundbreaking is expected next April with construction expected to take 13 to 15 months.

Caesars is in the midst of a $32 million gambling floor expansion at Indiana Grand Racing & Casino near Shelbyville that's set for completion later this year.

Hoosier Park general manager Trent McIntosh said the expansion will make the casino a better entity for Anderson and that previous discussions about adding a hotel remain ongoing.

The project comes after Indiana Grand and Hoosier Park were allowed to add live table games for the first time beginning in January 2020. They were previously limited to electronic games. Caesars bought the two casinos in 2018 for $1.7 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9kZWxhd2FyZS1wYXJrLWNhc2luby1yYWNldHJhY2stc29sZC1jbGFpcnZlc3QtZ3JvdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delaware Park Casino Sold to Clairvest Former Caesars Board Member,"Delaware Park Casino Sold to Clairvest Group and Former Caesars Board Member

Delaware Park will soon have a new owner for the first time in 38 years.

The storied thoroughbred horse racetrack and casino located in Wilmington is being sold to Canadian private equity firm Clairvest Group and Rubico Gaming LLC. Rubico is a gaming entity controlled by Thomas Benninger the founder of Global Leveraged Capital Advisors and a former board member of Caesars Entertainment.

Delaware Park is being sold by the Rickman family whose late patriarch William Rickman Sr. bought the racetrack in 1983. No purchase price was revealed. But a release from the involved entities said the sale is expected to close before the end of the year. The purchase does not include the casino’s White Clay County Club which will remain under Rickman family ownership.

[The family] felt this was the right time to sell” said Delaware Park President Bill Fasy speaking to Delaware Online.

Rickman Sr. died in 2005. His son William Rickman Jr. has overseen the casino and racetrack’s operations since 1993. But now in his mid-70s the younger Rickman is ready to pass the racino on to new owners. The Rickmans also previously owned Ocean Downs in Maryland but sold the Eastern Shore casino in 2017 to Churchill Downs.

Delaware’s prominent Du Pont family Delaware Park in 1937. It fared well during its early decades but fell on financial hardship in the 1970s due to increased competition. Rickman Sr. managed to turn the track profitable after taking it over and Rickman Jr. brought casino gambling to the property in 1995 following state approval.

Today the 100000-square-foot Delaware Park Casino features more than 2000 slot machines 40 table games a poker room and a sportsbook.

Clairvest Gaming Expansion

Clairvest Group owns an undisclosed position in the Meadowlands Racing & Entertainment harness racetrack and FanDuel sportsbook. The Ontario-based firm additionally has investments in Chilean Gaming Holdings and the Grey Eagle Resort & Casino in Alberta.

Clairvest’s purchase of a stake in Delaware Park shows that the private equity group is bullish on the US gaming industry. But Clairvest has much grander gaming ambitions.

Clairvest is seeking to build a $4.3 billion integrated resort in Japan’s Wakayama. The prefecture selected Clairvest as its IR development partner during the summer.

In September Clairvest announced that Caesars Entertainment was joining its Wakayama consortium. If Japan’s central government issues Wakayama one of the three IR permits Clairvest says Caesars will help design and operate the massive resort complex once complete.

In addition to serving on the Caesars board the entrepreneur and leveraged capital specialist has served on the boards of the former Tropicana Entertainment and Affinity Gaming.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV2YWRhaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd2l0aC1maXJlLWZlYXJzLWluLXRoZS1wYXN0LXNvdXRoLXRhaG9lLWNhc2lub3MtZm9jdXMtb24tZnV0dXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With fire fears in the past South Lake Tahoe casinos focus on future,"Northern California wildfires wiped away several weeks’ worth of business from casinos in South Lake Tahoe.

The largest blaze the Caldor Fire produced heavy smoke that substantially reduced air quality and induced highway closures that halted visitation from Northern California customers. Gaming operations which are normally crowded during the busy Labor Day weekend were shut down for six days.

South Lake Tahoe casino operators knew the shutdown was temporary. But they feared images of the blaze could fuel a misperception by customers that Northern Nevada’s picturesque gaming community was going up in flames.

In reality the Caldor Fire which consumed nearly 222000 acres over a two-month period never got closer than five miles from the city of South Lake Tahoe which neighbors the Nevada community of Stateline.

Hard Rock Lake Tahoe Executive Director of Marketing Eric Barbaro said national headlines and images circulated during the fire “sensationalized” the effect on the Tahoe region.

“The communication wasn't clear. You would have thought Tahoe had burned to the ground and the lake was going to have an environmental impact for years to come” Barbaro said in early October. “This has been a two-month ordeal for the market. We’re just getting back out of it.”

Karie Hall general manager of Harrah’s Lake Tahoe and Harveys Lake Tahoe said damage from the fire was non-existent in the populated areas of the community.

“We wanted to get that message to get out there that Tahoe is just as beautiful as it ever has been” Hall said. “There was some structure damage but the fire never got near the lake. It didn’t get near any of our properties. We were actually an evacuation site for a lot of folks.”

Beyond the temporary closures the fire compounded fears of a more rapid decline in the region’s gaming market which saw peak gaming revenue more than two decades ago amid the growth of tribal casinos in Northern California and lasting damage from the 2008 recession.

But nearly two months later the South Lake Tahoe gaming market appears to be rallying. Early snow falls during October gave hope for a busy winter ski season at the neighboring Heavenly Mountain Ski Resort and resort operators say hotel reservations through Christmas and the New Year have been picking up.

“The market is recovering guests are returning and we look forward to a great ski season” MontBleu Resort Casino General Manager Tim Tretton said. “The early snowfall and colder weather have created a great base for the ski resorts resulting in an early season and lift in room bookings.”

Doug Pierini chief operating officer of the Western Region for Vail Resorts (which owns Heavenly) said the ski area’s critical infrastructure was untouched.

“Thanks to the hard work and tremendous efforts of those on the ground both resorts’ winter downhill trails and features resort lodges equipment chairlifts and the Heavenly Tram and gondola all remain intact” Pierini said in an emailed statement in late September.

Tahoe casinos foresee a late 2022 opening for the long-planned $80 million Tahoe South Events Center. The 132000 square-foot facility is being constructed at the corner of the U.S. Highway 50 and Lake Parkway on land that was once a parking lot for MontBleu and will provide a location to host conferences sports tournaments and concerts with a capacity up to 6000 attendees.

“We first envisioned this in 2010 and we will be able to do so many different events” said Carol Chaplin CEO of the Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority.

South Lake Tahoe’s casino market is primarily made up of four casino resorts with three owners.

Hard Rock is owned by Las Vegas-based Paragon Gaming which licensed the name and brand from Hard Rock International. Harveys and Harrah’s are operated by Caesars Entertainment through a lease agreement with real estate investment trust VICI Properties.

MontBleu is expected to take on a new name later this month: Bally’s Lake Tahoe. The property’s operations were acquired earlier this year by Rhode Island-based Bally’s Corp. which is in the process of buying the operations of Tropicana Las Vegas.

The only other gaming entity in South Lake Tahoe is a Dotty’s slot machine parlor on Highway 50 near Harrah's.

Gaming revenues were soaring

The Labor Day shutdown came as the Tahoe market was on a rebound from 2020.

“Some people were having the best summer ever” Chaplin said.

The Gaming Control Board said the September revenue totals for South Lake Tahoe was $5.6 million a decline of 69 percent from pre-pandemic September 2019. Control Board analyst Michael Lawton said the figure represented the region’s lowest single-month revenue total in history — with the exception of April and May of last year when gaming operations were suspended statewide at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Extended road closures in California drove the recent revenue decline. U.S. Highway 50 the primary artery into South Lake Tahoe from the Bay Area and through Sacramento remained closed on the California side until Sept. 20. Highway 88 a road that helps connect Tahoe with Central California communities including Stockton was closed until Sept. 16.

Still South Lake Tahoe gaming revenue is up 13.3 percent for the first nine months of the year compared to 2019 when the market produced $225.6 million in gaming revenue. Before the September shutdown South Lake Tahoe was 22.9 percent ahead of 2019 revenue totals.

“This illustrates how strong gaming had been running up until the fire” Lawton said.

Calendar year 2000 was South Lake Tahoe’s highest-ever 12-month gaming revenue period at $352.6 million. But over time competition from Northern California tribal casinos and the 2008 recession took away visitation. South Lake Tahoe’s gaming totals through September are still down 28.1 percent from the 2000 record.

Over the last two decades South Lake Tahoe casino operators have upgraded facilities and have made a renewed commitment to the market.

“There are some great properties and fantastic assets up here” Hall said. Caesars recently completed roughly $40 million in renovations at Harveys including a remodeling of the hotel tower closest to the lake and adding restaurants such as Gordon Ramsey’s “Hell’s Kitchen.”

“There's more work to come it's not announced yet... they're primarily focused on the Harveys’ side but Harrah’s will get its love soon” Hall said.

During the COVID-19 shutdown South Lake Tahoe lost one gaming operator. The small Lakeside Casino Resort never reopened after the state’s 78-day shutdown was lifted. The ownership sold off the furnishings and interiors including the gaming equipment in an auction while the building and land were sold to Barton Health which will turn the facility into a medical center.

“They had plans to sell before COVID so it wasn't because of the pandemic” Chaplin said. “It was one of the times when it just didn’t make sense to keep going.”

A cooperative effort

After the fire danger subsided and South Lake Tahoe casinos reopened operators said a combined effort was needed to boost the gaming market’s prospects and assure visitors the region was open for business.

Similar cooperation took place before and after the casinos turned off their games between Sept. 1-6. The resorts served as temporary housing for firefighters and other first responders as well as for a number of California-based employees who were forced to evacuate.

The casino parking lots were transformed into command centers for the agencies fighting the Caldor Fire.

“Our biggest concern was the community” said Hall who grew up on the California side of Lake Tahoe before starting her career with Caesars. She has since managed several of the company’s casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and in Atlantic City.

She returned to Tahoe to oversee the two properties earlier this year.

“Obviously it's not always pleasant to close but we were happy to have become a host property to our firefighters and first responders” Hall said. “We really felt like the community stepped up. We’re all competitive and we all want to do well but really try and work together because that’s what is best for the entire region.”

Tretton agreed the South Lake Tahoe community “came together in a way that I have never seen before to support firefighters first responders and all law enforcement.”

Barbaro said Hard Rock’s back parking lot was filled with fire trucks from various local state and government agencies. But with the immediate fire danger out of the way the casino wanted to replace images of fire fighting with picturesque images of Lake Tahoe showing customers the area remained untouched.

Hard Rock sent photographers to those locations time-stamped and dated the photos and put them out in direct mail and email marketing pieces to the property’s database. The images were also distributed on Hard Rock’s social media channels.

“We showed them Tahoe was still in great condition beautiful and with no trees burnt in those areas” Barbaro said.

That cooperation efforts during and after the fire also included non-gaming businesses.

Jerry Bendel general manager of the Forest Suites Resort a 120-unit property on the California side tucked behind the Heavenly Village Shops and within walking distance of Harrah’s and Harveys jumped into action during the shutdown.

His onsite commercial laundry facility served firefighters staying at his property and the nearby casinos.

“We’re all in this together” Bendel said. Forest Suites guests often visit the casinos for dinners shows and gaming.

“A certain type of guests like to stay at the casinos and we get guests who prefer this type of setting” Bendel said. “There is plenty of business for everyone.”

Events center will transform the market

Chaplin believes the business lost during the fire shutdown was temporary. Before the fire Lake Tahoe brought in several high-profile events.

The annual American Century Celebrity Golf Championship was held at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in July following a one-year hiatus due to COVID-19. The event was televised by NBC.

In February two National Hockey League outdoor games – Vegas Golden Knights versus Colorado Avalanche and Boston Bruins versus Philadelphia Flyers – were played on a specially constructed ice rink at the Edgewood 18th hole and were also televised by NBC.

Chaplin said the images televised nationally offered Tahoe a tremendous marketing opportunity.

Hall added that the appeal of Lake Tahoe to outdoor enthusiasts hasn’t changed.

“People here are coming for leisure and they really want to ski or they want to hike” Hall said adding that the casinos’ biggest competition is “nature.”

The game-changer Chaplin believes is the Tahoe South Events Center which will feature 4200 seats for sports or entertainment and 6000 seats for stage events.

Tretton said Bally’s Tahoe is designing a long-range capital plan in conjunction with the events center and Barbaro said the Hard Rock views the multi-use facility as a venue for conferences concerts and shows that will benefit the entire market.

“It’s an opportunity to bring some cool stuff here” Barbaro said. “It really opens up Tahoe to proving that it's a beautiful place to come visit and you could do anything you want here whether it's personal or business.”",,,

The Hall which encompasses several performance corporate and gathering spaces that include a 2.5-acre sky park on its roof is being touted as one of the missing pieces in fulfilling Tysons’ aspiration to be ranked among America’s premier metropolises.

“This complex project will be a destination for all to enjoy and experience” said Jonathan Griffith Capital One Center’s Managing Director in a prepared statement.”

“As a Fairfax County resident I’ve been watching the evolution of this project for years” added Scott Cryer AIA LEED AP BD+C Associate Vice President and Principal with HGA which provided architectural and design services for this project which has been in the works for two decades ever since Capital One purchased land that had partly been used previously as a baseball field. What was missing from Tysons and what the Hall brings to the table Cryer explained to BD+C in a Zoom call is a large performance space and an equally prominent public space.

The project team on Capital One Hall included Whiting-Turner Construction (GC) Thornton Tomasetti (SE) ARUP (Code and Life Safety) WSP and GA Design (architectural consultants) and Stages Consultants (theater acoustics and AV consultant).

THREE PERFORMANCE SPACES

The building features a 1600-seat performance hall a 225-seat Black Box theater called The Vault a four-story open event space called The Atrium that can accommodate 1300 people standing or 300 seated at tables The Terrace that’s adjacent to the Atrium for cocktail parties and receptions of 450 standing or 180 seated and The Perch a public rooftop park and amphitheater for smaller concerts with a 230-person capacity.

The top floor of Capital One Hall has The Board Room for executive meetings of up to 20 people. And the ground floor has 21000 sf of retail space. (The building is next to an existing Wegmans supermarket.) The venue offers a rooftop biergarten and other food and beverage options. (ASM Global manages the building.) Next spring a miniature golf course and food-truck court are set to open on the roof.

The 300-suite Watermark Hotel that’s adjacent to The Hall was built simultaneously but with a different project team.

The next phase for this campus project will be the construction of two towers 30 and 24 stories respectively with a total of 900000 sf of office and retail space that are scheduled for delivery in 2023.

The Hall's 1600-seat performance space includes speakers built into the walls that are tunable to specific events.



A TIGHT FOOTPRINT TO WORK WITHIN

Michael Koch AIA NCARB a project architect with HGA noted during the Zoom call that the project team had to navigate what was a relatively tight rhombus-shaped footprint that required “shoehorning” the Hall into a space surrounded by existing (and higher) buildings. “We thought of this as a ‘box within a box’ approach” Koch says. The performance and gathering spaces within the Hall also sit atop a large loading dock and enclosed parking area each with limited clearances and depth.

This project presented unique acoustical challenges to prevent different structural elements from “touching” and to mitigate noise and vibration from people and vehicles within different areas of the building. One solution was to remediate the building’s load paths with acoustical pads “down below and on the roof” said Michael Cropper Senior Associate with Thornton Tomasetti. (Those load packs had to meet a three-hour fire rating as per county mandate says Cropper.)

Koch added that the “acoustically enhanced hall” includes speakers that are tunable to the specific performance and embedded behind perforated metal “wrappers” covering the walls.

Capital One Hall’s exterior is distinguished by marble cladding (from an Italian quarry chosen by ARUP) and windows that soar up to 100-ft tall. The site’s water-efficient landscaping includes a 30000-sf green roof and 16 street-side bioretentions for treating and retaining stormwater. The building’s HVAC and energy recovery systems should reduce its energy consumption by 27 percent compared to a comparable code-compliant building. The project anticipates a LEED 2009 NC Gold certification.

Cryer observed that multifunctional buildings like Capital One Hall are becoming more common in developments around the country that want “density” and aim to be “part of the urban ecology.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8xMS8wNi9jYXBpdGFscy1mbHllcnMtYWxleC1vdmVjaGtpbi1zbG93LXN0YXJ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capitals can't overcome another slow start fall at home to Flyers,"The Washington Capitals  staring at a two-goal deficit and the real possibility of their first home loss of the season raced onto the ice to start the third period Saturday night at Capital One Arena.

I think what makes my approach different is I lay out the theory behind my valuations I explain a lot of the moving pieces and I present a comparison between my valuations and the valuations others are giving.

I first laid this out the value of frequent flyer miles in 2014 and then updated values in 2016 2017 and 2019.

I skipped 2020 due to the pandemic but a tremendous amount has changed. Air Canada launched a new program with the same name (raising redemption prices but eliminating fuel surcharges) Delta and United devalued partner awards more than once Capital One launched transferrable points mostly at 1:1 and new program Bilt entered the transferable points space – to name just a few things.

Remember When A Mile Was Worth Two Cents?

Miles used to be thought to be worth 2 cents. I think that conventional wisdom developed out of the idea that a cross country flight cost about $500… or 25000 miles. 25 years ago that was generally true and award availability wasn’t really a problem either.

That was long before:

Airline alliances opened up huge possibilities to earn miles.

Mileage programs increased the cost of many awards.

Awards became tougher to get with flights full.

Plus the 2 cent number probably wasn’t ever a true value of miles to begin with since those flights didn’t earn miles or credit towards elite status and couldn’t be upgraded but on the other hand might be used for expensive last minute tickets.

Fast forward and the CEO of Delta talks about their miles being worth a penny. When American Airlines awards a mile for travel they book one cent of liability on their books under accounting rules adopted for 2018. Those rules required the airline to accrue the expected value of transportation to be provided in exchange for their miles.

The genius of miles is that they are worth more to consumers than they cost an airline to issue because frequent flyer programs are the largest purchasers of airline seats. They buy distressed inventory at a huge volume discount and sell those seats to us for points.

How to Think About The Value of Frequent Flyer Miles

Here’s how to think about the value of miles and points by airline hotel and credit card program.

It depends on how you redeem them. What value are you going to get for your points? The important thing here is not to use the retail price of a ticket you’re getting since

with premium cabin rewards you might not have been willing to spend that much cash. Frequent flyer tickets aren’t necessarily worth as much as a paid ticket. They don’t earn miles. They may not be upgradeable. And you can’t necessarily just pick whatever flight you want you have to be flexible and worry about award availability.

It depends on when you’re going to redeem them. You don’t earn a rate of return on miles and points like you might with cash in a bank or investment account. And you need to discount to present value if you’re going to use the points later. Plus there’s substantial risk of devaluation with many points currencies.

It depends on how many you already have. The value of points at the margin is different than an overall average value. As you approach having enough points for an award the marginal value of a few more points goes up substantially — since those extra points are what make the award possible. On the other hand once you have more points than you’ll redeem in the near-term the value of additional points falls since you may not ever use them or may not use them under current award charts.

The value of a mile is the amount at which you are indifferent to holding miles versus cash.

If a mile is ‘worth’ 2 cents you should be equally happy with a mile or two pennies if you’re offered a mile at a price of 1.9 cents you would be a buyer — you’d consider yourself to be earning a 5% margin.

Put another way when we put a charge on a credit card that doesn’t earn any bonuses (it earns 1 mile per dollar spent) we’re effectively buying that mile for 2 cents since the opportunity cost is putting the charge on a 2% cash back card. You’re revealing a preference through your behavior that you believe the mile is worth two cents.

The most valuable points at the top of my currency list are transferrable points. That American Express Chase Citi and Capital One (Venture/Spark Miles) points. You can transfer those into a variety of programs. Earning those gives you tremendous flexibility and optionality.

I’ve given two different values for Chase’s Ultimate Rewards which are transferable to miles and points. The higher value applies to those customers with a Sapphire Reserve or J.P. Morgan Reserve card who can redeem their points against certain categories of charges at 1.5 cents apiece in cash (versus 1.25 cents apiece for other Ultimate Rewards cards with transferable points).

How to Use These Valuations

Since valuation here is the amount at which you are indifferent to holding miles versus cash this figure is useful for:

Comparing when to spend miles or cash. Should I spend 50000 miles for an award ticket or $700?

Should I spend 50000 miles for an award ticket or $700? Comparing when to spend on airline’s miles versus another for the same award. Should I spend 25000 United miles or 35000 Delta miles?

Should I spend 25000 United miles or 35000 Delta miles? Comparing the value of different credit card signup bonuses. Is an 80000 point offer from Marriott better than a 75000 point offer from Hilton? In fact I view a 50000 point offer from Chase Sapphire Preferred better than both.

Is an 80000 point offer from Marriott better than a 75000 point offer from Hilton? In fact I view a 50000 point offer from Chase Sapphire Preferred better than both. Determining which hotel chain offers the better value reward when you’re considering staying at two different hotels. Should you spend 12000 Hyatt points or 35000 Hilton points?

Should you spend 12000 Hyatt points or 35000 Hilton points? Deciding whether to buy points when there’s a big bonus promotion.

Figuring out how much extra you might be willing to spend to earn points through a bonus promotion or figure out whether a hotel promotion should influence your decision about where to stay

But since the value of miles isn’t precise I won’t actually pay 1.3 cents for an American mile. I want to accumulate American miles when they’re substantially less costly than 1.3 cents apiece. And I know I am clearly not a buyer at 2.5 cents.

In practice these are fairly blunt tools that tell me “1 cent a point for American miles is a really good deal” but that I’m not going to spend 2 cents unless there’s a very specific scenario — like a few points at the margin to top off an account for an award I’ve put on hold — where it makes sense (and in that scenario my valuation of each point is higher since they’re helping me to save with a real redemption).

How My Valuations Compare to Others

I thought it would be interesting to compare side-by-side how One Mile at a Time and how The Points Guy value miles in comparison to my valuations.

I think you’ll find that I value most currencies a bit lower than others do. That’s perhaps because I’m not saying just what can you buy with the miles but I’m taking a discount for time (when will you use them? they don’t earn a rate of return like cash does) a volume discount (if you have a lot the value of the marginal mile falls pulling down the average) and a risk discount (miles are more likely to devalue than US dollars). I have a stronger preference for holding cash than miles than others do.

Overall I’d say that Lucky’s valuations are closer to mine than the TPG team’s are. For avoidance of doubt I’ll add as well that I have never taken payment for my valuation numbers and I’ve never felt that I need big numbers to make exaggerated claims about the value of a credit card.

Hollywood loves a good comeback story and throughout its 55-year history the Century Plaza Hotel has certainly had as many twists and turns as an Oscar-worthy screenplay.

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

Originally opened in 1966 the hotel was commissioned by Alcoa to be the centerpiece of Los Angeles' Century City development (and to showcase aluminum's utility as a construction material) on the former back lot of 20th Century Studios.

The 19-story 750-room hotel was designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki who was also the creative mind behind the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center. The Century Plaza soon became a landmark thanks to its distinctive crescent-shaped façade and the visual effect created by its reiterative balconies.

Over the years the hotel played host to Emmy and Grammy ceremonies and private concerts by the likes of Elton John. It was also the site of the only U.S. Presidential State Dinner ever to take place outside the White House hosted by Richard Nixon in 1969 to honor the Apollo 11 astronauts.

But after decades in the spotlight the hotel faced near-certain demolition at the hands of new developers … until a grassroots preservation campaign managed to save the property that is.

Now in the midst of an extensive $2.5 billion project the hotel has been restored to its former glory as part of a mixed-use development that includes two new 44-story residential towers. It reopened as a Fairmont in September 2021 and as someone who has visited the hotel off and on for nearly 30 years I couldn't wait to get a first glimpse inside.

Given the hotel was just two weeks into its new incarnation some of the eventual amenities and services were still not operational so this review is written with those (pardonable) shortcomings in mind.

Getting there

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

If you're not familiar with LA and its many neighborhoods Century City is fairly central and located just north and east of the convergence of two of the city's major thoroughfares the 10 and the 405 (as Angelenos would phrase it).

The hotel is about a 30-minute $30 rideshare from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) roughly 20 minutes east of the beaches of Santa Monica and about 30-40 minutes from downtown … assuming you're not driving at rush hour that is.

Booking details

Aiming to stake out a position among the highest-end luxury hotels of Los Angeles the Fairmont Century Plaza is currently posting room rates that start at $725 per night but are more often around $805. That said if you log into your Accor Live Limitless (ALL) account you might find member specials like the one that got me a room and daily breakfast for two for $715 per night.

Just be aware of taxes and fees which can add an extra $100 per night and valet parking which costs $65 plus tax per day.

Non-elite ALL members earn 25 points per 10 euros ($11.65) spent at participating hotels and can redeem them in increments of 2000 for 40 euros ($46.60) off hotel charges.

Standout features

The hotel's historic curving façade and overawing public areas were painstakingly renovated and have as dramatic an effect as ever upon arriving guests.

Designers leaned into the hotel's Tinseltown credentials with cheeky film and music references everywhere from the lobby bar's cocktail menu to rooms' do not disturb signs.

Eager-to-please staff are always on hand to help with everything from bags and bar orders to impromptu spa tours and lightning-fast housekeeping.

Though dining options are limited (and pricey) the contemporized French classics at Lumière make it feel like the perfect cross between a casual Parisian brasserie and a special occasion destination.

Drawbacks

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

In short: The cost of everything.

The hotel is among the priciest in the city but the relatively small and impersonal rooms might not measure up to competitors.

With gorgeous gray-stone corridors and treatments incorporating products like Natura Bissé the palatial 14000-square-foot spa is bound to be a draw for some though many guests might balk at the astronomical fees including $75 just to use the facilities.

The rooftop pool has show-stopping city views but feels small for a hotel of this size and does not get sun for large portions of the day.

All-day dining is not yet available so fire up DoorDash or Grubhub if you're hunkering down for a lunch meeting.

The vibe

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

Like me you might remember the Century Plaza Hotel from its most recent incarnation as a rather impersonal Hyatt Regency.

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

But the visionaries at design firm extraordinaire Yabu Pushelberg have reimagined the hotel in its mid-century modern heyday … with a few updates like Jaume Plensa's giant mesh sculpture dubbed ""Laura"" gazing out from the grand driveway and Ferrari-red nighttime lighting on the façade that makes the room balconies look like royal boxes in an old-world opera house.

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

Once overcrowded and dark the lobby has been transformed into a bright breezy space with a come-as-you-are cocktail lounge live water features and cozy fire elements plus private seating areas galore in which agents and studio execs will likely strike deals.

That said there have been major concessions to the new mixed-use and residential developments on the property. Gone is the expansive pool deck out back replaced by two condo towers that block the sun and coastal views at the new rooftop pool.

Given its location and price point the hotel is positioned to be most popular with business travelers looking to woo entertainment industry types as well as visiting celebrities in town on press junkets though leisure travelers in search of a centrally located base of operations should also enjoy it.

The room

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

Several of the tower's top floors have been converted to residences so there are only 400 guest rooms now including 49 suites and 70 Fairmont Gold rooms with access to the hotel's lounge and dedicated concierge service (as well as an on-demand martini cart for turndown service).

My standard category Fairmont King room was a respectable 320 square feet and located toward the northern end of the seventh floor with its own private balcony on which to enjoy breakfast or alfresco work (though the sun was bright out here for much of the day).

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Along with the pillow-top king bed dressed in white linens there was an oversized bureau with drawers for clothing and the minibar as well as a Nespresso coffee maker with a 65-inch HDTV on the wall above it. Next to the bed was a small sitting area with a marble-topped table that served (with some difficulty given its shape height and weight) as a desk though plugs and USB ports galore throughout the room made it easy to stay charged up.

Behind a sliding door the gray marble bathroom contained a single vanity a walk-in shower and a separate tub all stocked with Le Labo products in a sweet-smelling (but not redolent) bespoke Fairmont scent.

Overall the decor was understated which dampened the sense of luxury. However references to movies ranging from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Pretty Woman"" to ""Rocky"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" on items like the hanging tab for fresh linens and the bedside notepad brought some Hollywood glamor and fun to the ambiance.

Food and drink

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

A few weeks into the hotel's new chapter the dining options were still limited to breakfast and dinner at a single restaurant or via room service and a minor evening menu of small bites at the lobby bar. The rooftop pool bar was not yet online nor was all-day in-room dining.

Named after motion picture pioneers the Lumière brothers the hotel's main restaurant is located down the hall from the reception area and is a loving ode to bustling French brasseries with distinctive white and green tiling welcoming booths and an assorted array of brass light fixtures that play off the meaning of lumière.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

The dinner menu has all the usual suspects of mainstream French cuisine. The French onion soup ($16) was savory with a gooey gruyere topper while the seared sea bass ($38) was juicy and mild on its bed of onion soubise and roasted salsify. There are both cheese and charcuterie counters to order items from a la carte ($14-$26) and the luscious chocolate cremeux with cassis and black sesame ($14) for dessert is not to be missed.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

The breakfast menu is likewise small but satisfying with standards like avocado toast freshly baked pastries and even crepes with ham cheese and egg that arrived via room service equally fresh and hot as when enjoyed in the restaurant. Prices are exorbitant though: Breakfast for two was nearly $100 and dinner for two with drinks rang up at more than $300.

Trippy music-inspired libations in the lobby bar topped $20 apiece but were delicious. They included the old fashioned-like Camp Maclean with rye smoky lapsang souchong a drop of crème de cacao and Amara Averna bitters for nuance; and the surprisingly fruity and refreshing Forever 27 with Campari Cointreau orange juice egg whites and soda.

Amenities and service

One of the hotel's main draws is a rooftop pool with panoramas of the coast and the Hollywood Hills. Unfortunately in a design oversight the two new residential towers blot the sun out for a huge portion of the day and because the pool bar is not yet open there were no attendants on duty to check on guests.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

On the fitness front there is an expansive gym with its own mini Peloton studio and plenty of Technogym machines one level below the lobby. Guests can book private classes and training sessions too.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

This is also where guests will find the subterranean spa with a coed relaxation lounge with snacks and infusions as well as separate lockers for men and women each complete with a sauna a steam room and a shower experience that features customizable scents and lighting. The treatments are among the most expensive in town and include a 90-minute Amazonian facial with camu camu and Kakadu plum ($385) and a 90-minute immunity massage incorporating a mix of ginger lemon and oregano essential oils ($375).

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

As for overall service due to low occupancy rates so soon after opening it felt like there were at least two people helping us at any given time including seven valet attendants and three reception agents at check-in but this should change as rooms start to fill up. The one exception was up at the rooftop pool where we didn't see any hotel employees all day.

Out and about

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

Apart from its massive mall Century City is mostly a business-focused neighborhood. Its gleaming towers are filled with law offices accounting firms and talent agencies including CAA whose offices are just across the street from the hotel. That said you can literally walk into Beverly Hills to shop the boutiques on Rodeo and Canon or head slightly farther east for a night out at the restaurants on Robertson La Cienega or Melrose and the clubs along the Sunset Strip. A quick drive west will get you to the beaches of Santa Monica and Venice. After a long day though you might just want to stroll across Avenue of the Stars for a gourmet but laid-back meal at Tom Colicchio's flagship restaurant Craft.

Accessibility

The hotel has ADA rooms and housekeeping can provide shower chairs and raised toilet seats upon request. Most of the hotel's public areas appeared wheelchair accessible and the pool had a lift to allow easy entry and exit.

Checking out

While a welcome addition to the Los Angeles luxury hotel scene and a beautiful restoration of an iconic property the Fairmont Century Plaza doesn't feel quite sumptuous enough to justify its current room rates. The hotel is bound to regain its place as a favorite venue for lavish galas and entertainment industry events though guests looking for a more personalized stay or a more happening pool scene might want to look elsewhere."

Hyderabad Nov 6: 'Baahubali' 'Shahrukh' and 'Love Rana' are some of the super bulls attracting all the attention at the annual Sadar Utsav Mela here. 'Baahubali' brought from Haryana by the organisers weighs 2000 kg is 7.5 feet tall and 18 feet long. Named after the superhit movie its daily diet includes 25 litres of milk 20 eggs and three kg dry fruits.



The super bull's handlers say they also serve two bottles of premium Scotch every week to the giant bull which is taken for 5 km walk and swimming every day. They also massage it with almond oil for the glowing skin. 'Shahrukh' named after Bollywood superstar is three and a half years old and weighs 1800 kg. It has two handlers who take care of its daily food. Scotch whiskey worth Rs 3000 is served twice a week to help the animal's digestive system.



Another attraction at this year's event is 'Love Rana' brought from Haryana two years ago. It was born to 'Sultan Raju' who was once a national champion says Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader Madhu Yadav. ""We spend Rs 7000 to Rs 8000 on it daily but during Sadar Utsav this goes up to Rs 15000"" he said. Sadar Utsav is Hyderabad's annual buffalo carnival being organised by Yadav community for the last six decades.



While the celebrations last year were low-key due to the pandemic this year the organisers have made elaborate arrangements. The carnival was organised at Ameerpet Khairatabad West Marredpally areas of the city during the last couple of days the main event is scheduled to be held at Narayanguda on Saturday night. Telangana's Animal Husbandry Minister T. Srinivas Yadav attended the carnival at West Marredpally.



Around 4-5 years ago all the super bulls used to be brought from Haryana on rent for the event but now the members of Yadav community have purchased a few giant bulls and are rearing them at their dairy farms in the city. During the annual event held after Diwali specially decorated bulls are paraded through the roads accompanied with brass bands and DJ music with people dancing to 'teen-maar' steps.



The participating animals are also encouraged to rear up on their hind legs or bow with front knees on ground. ""We specially train them for this"" said Madhu Yadav. The Hyderabad police have imposed traffic restrictions in view of the Sadar Utsav Mela which will be celebrated at YMCA Narayanaguda. The restrictions will be in force from 7 p.m. on Saturday to 5 a.m. on Sunday.



Traffic will not be allowed towards YMCA from Kachiguda Road Vittalwadi Road Rajmohallah Reddy College Old Barkatpura Post Office Old Excise Office lane Barkatpura Chaman and other routes. The vehicles will be diverted at different points. Police have also appealed to the general public to take alternate routes to reach their destinations. Meanwhile a super bull brought for the carnival went berserk at Khairatabad on Friday injuring three passersby. It also damaged a two-wheeler. The handlers had a tough time controlling the animal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcm9ja2NlbGxhcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9rbm90ZmVzdC1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1yZXZpZXctc2xpcGtub3QtY29uY2VydC1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1icmluZy1tZS10aGUtaG9yaXpvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Knotfest Los Angeles Recap: Slipknot's Dark Carnival of Heavy Metal Precision,"Slipknot at Knotfest LA 2021 (Photo: Steve Thrasher)

That phrase — “crazy motherfuckers” — was directed by Taylor to the gathered masses many times throughout the evening eliciting excited shrieks from the thousands in attendance. Truly no better compliment could be given from the band leader/showman to his adoring fan base.

When Slipknot burst onto the scene in June 1999 with its self-titled album on Roadrunner Records it revolutionized the heavy metal/hard rock scene of the time spawned imitators and quickly created a genre all its own — but while many of those similar acts fell off quickly Slipknot endured a force of resilience and focus that remains a viable global musical entity more than two decades later.

That status was reaffirmed at Knotfest Los Angeles a triumphant exercise in the form of an all-day festival atmosphere that felt transplanted from before the pandemic Slipknot delivering a career-spanning set to its unflinchingly loyal fan base. We’re talking wearing-a-Slipknot-shirt-to-the-show-and-buying-a-stack-of-new-shirts-from-the-merch-stand-level loyalty.

For many fans Slipknot provided a bridge to heavy metal music the band’s boundless brutality mixed with some killer hooks (such as on “Wait and Bleed” from that self-titled 1999 record). Looking around the venue throughout the day one could appreciate the variety of metal acts that were also represented by t-shirts worn by those in attendance brought together by Slipknot a list including but not limited to:

Hatebreed

Carnifex

Bullet for My Valentine

System of a Down

Spiritbox

Goatwhore

Metallica

Pantera

Machine Head

The show featured many of the acts that had accompanied the band on the road starting in late September — Killswitch Engage Fever 333 and Code Orange with notable additions The Cherry Bombs Vended and Bring Me The Horizon the latter of which was well-represented by t-shirted fans throughout the venue.

Opening the show was Vended a young metal band featuring Griffin Taylor (son of Slipknot vocalist Corey Taylor) and Simon Crahan (son of Slipknot founder/percussionist/”Clown” Shawn Crahan) that put on a crushing show for the smattering of folks who made it inside the venue at 2 in the afternoon.

For Code Orange the Knotfest Roadshow came after the Pittsburgh PA.-based metal/experimental band elevated its profile during the pandemic with some visionary live stream events.

Previously the band had earned the seal of approval from Taylor and had amassed a strong audience of its own but the Knotfest stage provided a solid “breakout” opportunity for the outfit.

Early-afternoon sets on stacked bills aren’t the envy of any act but Code Orange thrived commanding the audience and even starting up some intense circle pits for songs from 2017’s Forever and 2020’s Underneath (the album at the center of those ambitious live stream events). This is a band on a serious upward trajectory in the metal scene and Knotfest will no doubt help them on their continued ascent.

Fever 333 turned in a typically energetic set of incendiary punk/metal front man Jason Butler shouting out his hometown of Inglewood while running sliding and sprinting around the stage at one point even stripping down to his underpants and doing a stunt on a skateboard across the stage.

As the sun began to set the atmosphere in the building became one of palpable anticipation fans realizing it was drawing even closer to Slipknot’s headlining performance likely the first many of these fans had seen since before Spring 2020.

But before that could happen metalcore veterans Killswitch Engage crashed onto the stage for a pounding set of precise anthems of memorable thrash vocalist Jesse Leach hitting all the notes perfectly with his powerful singing voice.

Killswitch dabbled in songs from throughout its career dating back to 2002’s Alive or Just Breathing and carrying into 2019’s Atonement before wrapping the set with the band’s cover of Ronnie James Dio’s “Holy Diver” which was epic.

Next up on the night were The Cherry Bombs the rock and roll dance group featuring Alicia Dove Corey Taylor’s wife. The group has participated in several Slipknot and Taylor-related events over the past few years and they were a seamless fit into the evening’s activities at Knotfest dancing around on stage to a variety of hard rock classics and doing acrobatic stunt work that presented a bit of a stylistic break between bands.

The Cherry Bombs also harkened back to earlier iterations of the Knotfest tour when Slipknot packed more types of entertainment across multiple stages beyond musical acts.

English outfit Bring Me the Horizon was up next and the band emerged donning matching gray suits for a Beatles-esque appearance (that the band also wore at the tiny warm-up gig at the Whisky a Go Go earlier in the week). The addition of Bring Me the Horizon to Knotfest Los Angeles was a special treat for ticketholders as the band was not part of the Roadshow tour overall.

It was also special since Bring Me the Horizon is an arena act all its own in the United States and even bigger overseas back home in the UK. As a result the group delivered a stadium-ready set of theatrical hard rock that shied away from the band’s early death metal material opting instead for tracks from 2020’s POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR EP including “Obey” which featured a guest appearance from Yungblud.

Three tracks from 2013’s Sempiternal (“The House of Wolves” “Can You Feel My Heart” and “Shadow Moses”) gave old-school fans a chance to let loose a bit more than the newer more pop-oriented tracks (like new single “Die4u”) allowed as the group clearly knows it can’t totally abandon its roots.

There was an hourlong break between Bring Me the Horizon and Slipknot which may seem a bit excessive until the curtain dropped and the headliners’ uniquely elaborate stage design was revealed.

Remember that Slipknot employs nine members: Taylor Crahan drummer Jay Weinberg guitarist Mick Thompson guitarist Jim Root keyboardist Craig Jones DJ Sid Wilson bassist Alessandro Venturella and touring percussionist Michael Pfaff.

That’s a lot of people on one stage and most of them move around all corners of the performance space (especially Pfaff and Crahan who each had their own drum area/walkways flanking each side of the stage) — so the setup has to allow maximum maneuverability. Plus there was a huge pulsating light show and backlit LED screen accentuating the visual overstimulation not to mention occasional bursts of fire (some directly blasted from guitars themselves).

Lest you think Slipknot is all bombast and grandiose stage antics though the band backed up the theatrics with a powerhouse musical performance led as always by Taylor who spoke a few times about how appreciative he and the band were for the fans over the years as well as the fact that the Knotfest Roadshow tour managed to complete its trek without any COVID-19 related setbacks which remain an issue across the live music scene at large.

Slipknot’s set list brought together fan favorites and classics from the band’s lengthy catalog touching on that ’99 LP for a few key tracks pulling some from 2019’s dark We Are Not Your Kind and even giving a new song “The Chapeltown Rag” its live debut.

A frenetic middle finger to social media the media and the connections between the two the song was premiered on streaming platforms prior to Knotfest Los Angeles as a preview of an upcoming studio record.

Slipknot’s set list didn’t vary too much from what the band had performed for most of the tour and leaving out “Eyeless” (an early song that was used in promotion of the LA show and features the lyric “You can’t see California without Marlon Brando’s eyes”) was an odd choice but fans were energized throughout.

The band’s performances are all-out sonic assaults and it’s a testament to the band members’ resilience that they’re still around in the first place. A great deal of behind-the-scenes turmoil has affected the band over the years but still Slipknot remains powering through the darkness with the visceral nature of its music held afloat by a global audience of adoring fans who consider Slipknot a lifestyle far more than “a band.”

It’s that deep connection between artist and fan that makes Slipknot such an engaging musical force and that energy elevated Knotfest LA from more than “a concert” to “an experience” that none in attendance will forget anytime soon.

The following is the first of a series of articles on ‘the essence of Trinidad and Tobago’s Carnival’ by Avah Atherton titled ‘The Art of Rebellion’:

Listen carefully. This is where it all began. Down through the hill towns Belmont and Laventille and through the streets of the capital Port-of-Spain. In the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago the southernmost islands in the Caribbean.

Born out of the desperate attempts of enslaved Africans to protect what little they had left of their culture. Carnival.

A frenzy of beautiful bodies covered in varying amounts of beads and feathers. A riot of colour pulsating to the sounds of our local musical genres: calypso and its contemporary incarnation soca.

Old and young locals and foreigners masqueraders and spectators all are captivated. This is Carnival Monday and Tuesday. This is what most of the world sees.

But this is all a beautiful lie a glorious mask that shields the true nature of Carnival. Welcome to the Art of Rebellion.

The Art of Rebellion is a series of articles that reveals through an exploration of important traditional Carnival characters the essence of Trinidad and Tobago’s Carnival one of the most influential street festivals in the world.

*****

Beginning just after Christmas the Carnival season is marked by weekly fetes (parties) competitions and in every neighbourhood the unmistakable sound of the steelpan.

Carnival practitioners spend months preparing for the culmination of the festivities on the two days immediately preceding the Catholic observance of Ash Wednesday. With its long history Carnival combines costuming elements of the European colonisers with religious and traditional aspects of African Indian and Indigenous cultures. While some characters and rituals originated during the Slave Trade the end of slavery in 1838 ushered in the official two-day celebration.

In many ways it served then and now as a form of healing rebirth and transformation for Trinidadians and Tobagonians.

Carnival in Trinidad has inspired offshoots in major cities around the world but still thousands of visitors flock to the island state to experience events first-hand. This has made Carnival a significant economic driver for local artistes.

However traditional knowledge related to historical characters and rituals too often die with practitioners robbing younger generations of their cultural inheritance. Although traditional characters remain commonplace in Trinidad’s Carnival their origins and importance have faded from the memories of most locals.

In their place a mass-produced Carnival has emerged—one that tramples the efforts of our ancestors to be seen heard and understood using the social and political commentary that accompanies most traditional characters. As their cries fade so too does our ability to truly understand our history and ourselves.

Today there are traditional masqueraders who choose to maintain the original portrayals and others who subvert them in order to give them bold new meanings.

Mas the shortened form of masquerade is divided into two main categories: pretty mas and ole (old) mas.

Pretty mas costumes the more glamorous version of Trinidad’s Carnival feature stylised body suits or bikinis with matching arm and leg pieces along with a wire-frame shoulder or head piece.

Ole mas consists of traditional Carnival characters such as Baby Doll Moko Jumbie Midnight Robber Fancy Indian Jab Jab Burrokeet and Bat.

While pretty mas is more popular today communities where traditional characters originated and those interested in cultural preservation maintain elements of the old costuming and performance.

These characters are both products of and rebellions against the country’s history of colonisation slavery indentureship and displacement.

Supple white gloves a veil or mask sheer stockings and on the feet tightly laced Mary Janes—if you own a pair. A doll with rosebud lips and bright eyes finishes the costume.

The Baby Doll character comes to life.

They roam the streets during Carnival accusing male spectators of being their child’s father and demanding immediate child support. Often the masquerader refuses to leave becoming louder and more insistent until the alleged father responds with a few dollars.

The chagrin of the accused is heightened by the amusement of the spectators but the Baby Doll is not yet done moving boldly to the next man and unashamedly making the same accusations and demands.

The Baby Doll character represents many layers of historical oppression and disenfranchisement. Trinidadian author Jeff Henry explains the origin of the character as a representation of ‘the sexual exploitation of women from the days of bondage when slave owners saw it as their right to demand sexual favours from their bond women. These women had no rights under the law and submitted to the sexual demands of their owners or estate overseers.’

During the Slave Trade illegitimate children were considered merely another product of the plantation and were often sold off tearing families apart while ensuring a constant supply of low-cost labour. An 1813 registry of enslaved Africans in Trinidad shows that at that time almost half of the enslaved population had European ancestry.

Few spectators even locals understand the Baby Doll within the political and social context of the late 19th century when women were disenfranchised in many areas of life. Under British colonisation from 1763 to 1962 class and race restrictions denied women of colour and their offspring basic rights and privileges.

Local writer Debbie Jacob positions the Baby Doll character as an ‘extortion’ masquerade stating that masqueraders used the performance ‘to confront the upper-class society that marginalised them’.

Still the character can easily be dismissed by spectators as a promiscuous irresponsible woman.

Dancer and Carnival band leader Makeda Thomas describes the character in an interview for the Trinidad Guardian newspaper: “It’s about a mother who is trying to hold someone accountable for a child and can be played very pitifully and I’ve seen our reaction to that type of performance be very disdainful.”

Today portrayals by local activists position the Baby Doll as a means of addressing prevalent problems in Caribbean society advocating for feminist social justice particularly in the areas of gender and sexuality.

“This is a performance by women to check the men in the community for behaviours that are harming the community” Thomas declares.

In 2019 she and her band formed the Belmont Baby Dolls to change the narrative surrounding the Baby Doll masquerader. They used the character to affirm motherhood female sexuality and the lived experiences of Black women.

“We can place the power of this mas in healing in our love relations… versus the parody the satire the drama” Thomas says.

In so doing her group creates ‘space for something other than trauma’.

Their portrayals explore relationships to create a healing transformation that embodies the spirit of Carnival.

“Which is what mas is about right?” she asks. “That there is something that happens through the costuming but also the performance of that thing and the intention especially in our colonial context in which we were bred to hate ourselves. And you know hate comes quicker than love.”

Jacqueline Burgess is a 73-year-old mas veteran who has been participating in Carnival for over 60 years.

“I played pretty mas I also played traditional mas I played Bat Burrokeet I played the Midnight Robber” she says. “But I really loved the Baby Doll.”

Burgess dismisses the traditional portrayal of the character stating that masqueraders have moved beyond a performance that is demeaning to women and have chosen to use it as a form of protest art. When Burgess created a Baby Doll workshop and gave masqueraders design autonomy they used their performance to highlight the issues of the day.

“Domestic violence was addressed HIV/AIDS policing and police brutality even sexual and reproductive rights” Burgess says.

She believes the character can empower women that women should craft their own narrative based on their experiences.

These issues are prevalent and worsening: in 2020 half of the reported murders of women in Trinidad and Tobago were as a result of domestic violence.

Earlier this year two boys witnessed the death of their mother Adeina Alleyne at the hands of their father. Prior to the attack Alleyne had made several reports of domestic abuse and violence to the police. To no avail.

Large-scale unemployment due to the Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated these problems as domestic abuse reports for the first few months of 2021 nearly doubled compared to the same period last year.

As the organiser of a children’s band and network coordinator for the Advancement of Women and Working Women for Social Progress Burgess promotes the Baby Doll as an advocacy tool for year-round exploration of societal issues and to build a community of support for women.

In 2011 she created a Baby Doll band to commemorate the 100th International Women’s Day.

“It is such a powerful character that you can use it for almost anything” she says. “That whole thing about advocacy and how you build and share awareness of certain issues the Baby Doll’s voice could be used.”

The aircraft carrier which returned to Bremerton in March after a record-setting 11-month-long deployment now begins the work at sea preparing for the next one.

The 3000-strong crew of the 1092-foot-long warship completed a ""fast cruise"" Wednesday that included simulations and equipment tests that help ""refresh and train sailors for underway periods"" the Navy said.

It's the culmination of 330000 man-days of work at the shipyard which included laser alignments on the ship's aircraft-launching catapults and inspections of around 60000 tubes on the carrier's main engines. Nimitz Capt. Craig C. Sicola praised his sailors and the workforce at the shipyard for their teamwork ""to get the job done safely and on time"" he said in a statement to the Kitsap Sun.

""Since taking command of the Nimitz I have been astounded by the amount of effort and motivation shown by everyone involved and it's because of their hard work that we are able to return to sea and operate forward"" said Sicola a veteran aviator who took command of the ship in July.

The 100000-ton warship made global headlines on a deployment that was the first among aircraft carriers during the COVID-19 pandemic and one that followed an outbreak on board its sister carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. The warship fighter jets flew sorties against the Islamic State in the Middle East trained in the disputed waters of the South China Sea and maintained a ""bubble"" to ensure the virus that causes COVID-19 could not infect the crew.

The 1975-commissioned Nimitz the oldest of the country's 11 active aircraft carriers is one of two homeported in Bremerton. The USS Theodore Roosevelt emblazoned with its red white and blue-lit 71 hull number is in dry dock at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for an overhaul.

The Nimitz No. 68 of the nation's carrier fleet is named for Chester Nimitz the legendary fleet admiral who helped the U.S. defeat the Japanese Navy in World War II. It's likely to embark in a few months on one of its last deployments as the Navy is calling for its retirement in 2025. But there has been some discussion in the Navy of temporarily extending its service life.

Well it almost happened!

The versatile fourth-generation F-16 has been a mainstay in the US Air Force’s arsenal for over four decades now. USAF operates around 1245 F-16s out of over 4600 operational across the world. It took its maiden flight in 1974.

The Lockheed Martin-General Dynamics aircraft is in active service with the Israeli Air Force Pakistan Air Force Turkish Air Force Egyptian Air Force Royal Netherlands Air Force Royal Norwegian Air Force Belgian Air Component among other users.

How Hornet Ruined Falcon’s Prospects?

After visible success with USAF the US Navy too was keen on developing a carrier-capable F-16. However despite Navy-specific modifications the naval variant of the F-16 never saw the light of the day.

The competition for a lucrative contract between what we know as the Fighting Falcon and Hornet family was chronicled by Alex Hollings in the Sandboxx News.

The F-16 which is the brainchild of General Dynamics was initially designated as the YF-16 when it was competing with Northrop Grumman’s YF-17 (operationally inducted as F/A-18 Hornet.)

The YF-17 was a lightweight prototype which was projected as a cheaper alternative to the F-15 Eagle one of the most sophisticated air-superiority fighters during that era.

While the USAF preferred YF-16 to YF-17 both General Dynamics and Northrop Gruman soon geared up for a carrier-capable fighter deal for the US Navy which saw potential in what would later become F-16.

Both the competing aerospace giants never made carrier-borne fighters before. However the prospect of a potential big-ticket contract sprang both firms into action. Each teamed up with companies that had the technological know-how and experience with aircraft carriers.

General Dynamics brought Vought onboard to upgrade their F-16 platform into the ‘Vought Model 1600’. Northrop Grumman collaborated with McDonnell Douglas to convert their YF-17 into a navy fighter which went on to become the F/A-18 Hornet.

Prerequisites set by the US Navy included long-range radar for intercept missions and multi-role capabilities which had become a core facet of American air warfare.

The F-16 was originally conceptualized to serve as a simple fighter intended for air superiority roles. The Falcons made their transition into a multi-role aircraft following a series of events during the development process.

Holling described an incident involving the ‘Lightweight Fighter Mafia’ a moniker given to the F-16s designers at General Dynamics. The designers had aimed to retain the aircraft’s “gold-plating”. They felt that this would remain universal in new fighter aircraft.

This “gold plating” consisted of fire control radar electronic countermeasures radar-guided missiles ground-attack capabilities and other features typically associated with a standard fourth-fifth generation fighter these days. The Falcon was outfitted with AN/APG-66 radar along with other additions bolstering its ground-attack capabilities.

However the aircraft lacked radar-guided air-to-air weapons which were foregone in preference of heat-seeking Sidewinder missiles. These collective enhancements made the F-16 far more suitable for the US Navy’s needs. The F-16 had surpassed expectations however despite its best efforts could not make the cut.

Why Did F-16 Fail?

The Vought 1600 was around three feet longer than the F-16A. The aircraft was two feet broader than the USAF version.

The naval variant sported a wingspan of 33 feet and three inches. The overall breadth of the wings reached 269 feet. This allowed the aircraft to maintain stability when flying at lower speeds.

Additionally the jet’s fuselage was slightly flattened in order to make it broader. Its canopy was specifically designed to ensure that it would pivot forward. This feature was distinct from the F-16 (however is now common on the F-35 platform).

The aircraft’s heavy-duty landing gears were required to be fixed to the aircraft’s belly along with other carrier-based equipment like a landing hook. The fuselage itself was made stronger and in order to offer the engagement range the Navy needed a pulse-doppler radar for beyond visual range targeting was also added.

All of these upgrades were required to convert the aircraft into a carrier-capable fighter and in accordance with the navy’s needs.

However despite the modifications the F-16 lost the battle to the YF-17. While the Hornet may not have been cut out to meet USAF’s operational needs the aircraft did fit into the US Navy’s carrier vision and has served America’s maritime interests with distinction.

The biggest drawback of the Vought 1600 was its low-lying intake located above the aircraft’s nose wheel which sparked a major cause of concern with regards to safety on the carrier’s flight deck as unsuspecting sailors could get sucked into it. No wonder that the prototype was infamously dubbed “Gator” for the risk it posed to sailors.

Furthermore the F-16’s lack of radar-specific weapons and lightweight meant that it was virtually unsuitable for all-weather operations like intercepting enemy fighter aircraft or hostile bombers flying towards a carrier strike group.

Schlesinger And His Lobby

Then-Defense Secretary James Schlesinger was reportedly hell-bent on ensuring the Vought 1600 be inducted into the US Navy despite reservations from the Navy’s top brass. Schlesinger had invited Admiral Holloway to discuss the Navy’s future fighter and put the issue to bed for good.

Adm. Holloway recounted in his book that he was ambushed by the Defense Secretary who had amassed over a dozen individuals to pitch the Vought 1600 to the US Navy. However Adm. Holloway continued to cite the concerns relayed by his engineers even as the lobbyists argued that those challenges could be mitigated with better pilot techniques.

These arguments however did not hold water as they were detached from operational reality. Compared to the Vought 1600 the YF-17 offered a second engine which made the difference between having to dump an aircraft at sea and making a relatively smooth landing aboard the aircraft carrier.

If similar capabilities were pitched and successfully demonstrated by the Vought 1600 the Fighting Falcon would very well be the navy’s mainstay carrier-borne fighter a position held by the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet for the past 40 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL2luZHVzdHJ5L2F2aWF0aW9uL3N0b3J5L2Fpci1mcmFuY2Uta2xtLWhvcGVzLWluZGlhLXdpbGwtbGV0LWl0LWluY3JlYXNlLWZsaWdodHMtdG8tbWVldC1yaXNpbmctZGVtYW5kLTMxMTQ5Ny0yMDIxLTExLTA30gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL2luZHVzdHJ5L2F2aWF0aW9uL3N0b3J5L2Fpci1mcmFuY2Uta2xtLWhvcGVzLWluZGlhLXdpbGwtbGV0LWl0LWluY3JlYXNlLWZsaWdodHMtdG8tbWVldC1yaXNpbmctZGVtYW5kLTMxMTQ5Ny0yMDIxLTExLTA3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air France-KLM hopes India will let it increase flights to meet rising demand,"Air France-KLM's current Indian services are limited under the air bubble restrictions but the airline is hopeful that the Indian government will allow it to increase its flights to meet the rising demand a senior executive of the carrier said.

Since July 2020 India has allowed limited special international flights with passenger restrictions under air bubbles formed with approximately 28 countries including France and The Netherlands.

Scheduled international flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 last year.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic the airline operated 38 weekly flights from three Indian cities -- Bengaluru Delhi and Mumbai -- to Paris and Amsterdam Jean-Noel Rault General Manager (Indian Sub-continent) Air France-KLM told PTI in an interview.

Currently Air France-KLM is operating 17 weekly flights from four Indian cities -- Bengaluru Delhi Mumbai and Chennai -- to Paris and Amsterdam as per the air bubbles formed between India and France in July 2020 and India and The Netherlands in November 2020.

When asked if he sees the demand rising on India flights Rault stated ""India has a very strong VFR (visiting friends and relatives) market. This in my opinion is one of the key factors to drive demand.""

""We have also seen the student segment develop favourably thanks to the convenient connections we offer and have received positive response to the Chennai-Paris direct operations launched in June by Air France"" he added.

The airline's expectation was business and corporate travel will progressively grow in second half of 2022 Rault noted.

However the carrier's scope was still limited in terms of frequency and destinations under the air bubble restrictions he added.

""We are hopeful with the progressive opening of borders we will be allowed to increase our frequency to meet the evolving demand"" he mentioned.

Rault said Air France-KLM in the current specific circumstances in India has been operating services with the aim to cover the variable costs of each individual flight operation.

""In trends the variation has been high in load factors in the past 12 months...On a positive note for the first time since the pandemic we see load factors moving up for flights to India"" he added.

Air France-KLM believes that increase in flights' frequencies should be considered with the progressive opening of international borders and growing demand he said.

""We continue to interact with relevant authorities along with the French embassy and The Netherlands embassy in India. Together with our embassies we continue to explore opportunities with the Indian authorities to expand the number of flights from India"" Rault noted.

When asked if he thinks India should open scheduled international flights now he replied it could be prudent for India to consider moving towards ""a normal world with progressive reopening of international commercial operations"" as the country is doing very well with the vaccination drive and the COVID-19 situation improving globally.

""This would be instrumental in facilitating travel to and from India boost incoming tourism to India which is much needed to help the economy and local operators who have been impacted severely due to the pandemic"" Rault added.

Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had in September said that the Centre has to look to put in place certain systems to boost long-haul international flights of Indian carriers to places such as Europe and South America.

Lufthansa group CEO Carsten Spohr had last month said that restricting air traffic between India and Germany is hurting both the economies and the airline group was eagerly waiting for the Indian government to allow more flights between the two countries.

It is fun though.

INDIANAPOLIS — It's a folklore favorite for many Hoosiers - predicting the harshness of our upcoming winter based on sightings of ""wooly worms"" and their color patterns. Recently our Verify team talked with the National Weather Service and biologist Frank Fowler who confirmed this isn't a reliable way to tell what kind of winter is pending.

It is fun though.

So what does each color mean? According to the theory mainly black wooly worms predict a harsher winter. A mostly brown worm signifies a milder winter. If brown at the head with more black near the tail it means a winter that starts mild and ends harshly.

In reality the coloration and the length of the bands do have a correlation to how severe the previous winter was. Wooly worms are born in the spring all black. The more warm the growing season the wider that round brown band becomes in the middle.

You can also tell the age of the wooly worm based on its color. Each time it sheds its coat it becomes redder.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vbm9ydGhlcm5vbnRhcmlvLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvbmV3LXJlc2VhcmNoLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1iZW5lZml0LXRvLWNhdGVycGlsbGFyLWRyb3BwaW5ncy0xLjU2NTUxODnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New research highlights environmental benefit to caterpillar droppings,"SUDBURY -

The summer 'scourge' of the tent caterpillar that Sudbury has endured these last few summers may actually have been working to help the environment.

That's the findings of a new paper from the University of Cambridge where PhD student Sam Woodman found they're actually helping to improve water quality of nearby lakes.

""What we found was sort of after an insect outbreak of typically caterpillars who are feeding on leaves traditionally you'd think of the effects of it mostly being on the trees themselves eating the leaves and that's harming the trees in someway but in reality they have effects beyond that"" Woodman told CTV News.

Woodman who’s originally from Lethbridge collaborated with Laurentian University's Living with Lakes Centre to study the effects of caterpillars in the region.

""After they eat the leaves that has to be excreted out at some point pooped out as it were and that feces is released into the environment and it has its own effects"" he explained.

They found it's been working to help improve water quality of nearby lakes on a huge scale. The researcher admits it came as a surprise to see the large increase in nitrogen and decrease in carbon.

According to their findings the excrement washes into lake water and acts s fertilizer for microbes which they releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as they metabolize.

The excrement or frass as it's called is said to be highly dissolvable so after a heavy rain it's washed into nearby waterways.

""I was surprised by the magnitude of it this was the idea I had when I applied for my PhD and I had this thought that disturbance events can have a massive effect on the landscape but they're not limited to the landscape that they occur in and how can we look at those effects beyond the force they occur in"" he said.

But Woodman says it's also a delicate balancing act when it comes to the caterpillars from an ecological point of view. Too much of a good thing could lead to impacts in other ways.

""Knowing about the effects will allow us to manage for it better so if an entire forest was eaten by caterpillars that might clean up the water clarity that year but then you might get a ton of algae growing and that might promote some harmful algae at some point” said Woodman.



“And the opposite case if you got rid of all these caterpillars well we might be losing some bumps in nitrogen that might be occurring and losing out in the lakes' health over all so it's not necessarily about it being good or bad it's about keeping it in balance.""

The study also warned of northwards range expansion any increased inspection population growth as a result of climate changes. It's putting northern forests at increased risk of defoliator’s outbreaks in the future and could cause greater quantities of CO2 to be released from nearby lakes.

The study was recently published in the journal Nature Communications and is believed to be one of the most extensive studies ever undertaken on the topic.

Forest defoliator outbreaks alter nutrient cycling in northern waters | Nature Communications

They looked at invasive Gypsy moths and Forest tent caterpillars.

Laurentian University's Living with Lakes Centre worked as a collaborator on the project. The Centre's director John Gunn believes many in Sudbury will end up finding the results fascinating.

""In Sudbury our soils are really poor and the caterpillars are doing us a favour they're turning those trees into tea and that tea is flowing into the lakes feeding fish and at the same time rebuilding the soil so when we're dealing with conditions like Sudbury where the soil is so poor yes the caterpillars are good"" he said.

Gunn admits he like many in the city doesn't like them but they are doing a good job in fixing up the landscape.

In Sudbury it's not unusual to see foil or soap at the bottom of a tree as some residents try to protect their property. Gunn says that's fine.



""When you step back and look at the bigger forest there's really nothing we can do about it it's very much like the farmers going and plowing down the alfalfa to enrich the soil in the fall. The insects are doing that for us they're fixing the soil across the landscape"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phc29uLXRhdGUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE0NjI4NDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jason Tate Obituary - Simons Mortuary - 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/jason-tate-obituary?id=31462845 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phc29uLXRhdGUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE0NjI4NDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vdGZsdHJ1Y2suY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvdmlkZW8tdGhpcy1vc2hrb3NoLTEweDEwLWlzLWJlaW5nLXR1cm5lZC1pbnRvLXRoZS1sYXJnZXN0LW9mZi1yb2FkLW1vdG9yaG9tZS15b3Utd2lsbC1ldmVyLXNlZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video: This Oshkosh 10×10 Is Being Turned Into the Largest Off-Road Motorhome You Will Ever See,"If you ever wanted to bring your entire house with you on your next off-road trip this Oshkosh M1074 10×10 wants to be the ultimate off-road home away from home. It’s being built by the team at Couch Off-Road in Colorado. It’s based on this massive 10×10 PLS diesel military truck.

PLS stands for Palletized Load System. This truck’s military purpose is to transport large loads and/or shipping containers wherever there is a need. This truck is designed to carry a payload of 16.5 tonnes (approximately 35000 lbs) over rough terrain. It can probably carry more weight if the need arises. The truck is equipped with a hydraulic crane that can pick up a 20-foot long pallet or a shipping container of approximately the same size.

The 10×10 is powered by a 15.2-liter Caterpillar (C15) diesel I6 engine that can deliver approximately 600 horsepower. A massive Allison 5-speed automatic transmission and an Oshkosh 2-speed transfer case send the power to the ground. This truck is rolling on 53-inch tall all-terrain tires. The front two axles steer. The rear axle counter steers to help this long beast make turns.

This truck can also be very useful as an off-road recovery vehicle. Instead of using a winch the crane can be used to lift a stuck vehicle and help to drag it to safety.

These trucks can also be equipped with a six-wheel cargo trailer. Couch Off-Road is working to convert this 10×10 and a matching trailer into a massive off-road motorhome. We hope to see it as the project gets closer to completion.

Check out the operation of the crane and a complete walkaround below!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvcGFyYXNpdGljLXdhc3BzLXpvbWJpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"A ""zombie"" creature maligned by Charles Darwin could save millions","Wasps have a reputation for being jerks because of their perceived aggressiveness and ability to sting repeatedly. They’re often negatively compared with the honey production and agricultural pollination of bees.

If wasps are jerks however they are positively saintly compared to their parasitic brethren.

Parasitic wasps sting to inject their eggs into a host often accompanied by venom and a virus. Their larvae grow and eventually emerge from the unwitting host — usually ending its life. Then they become adults and fly off to continue the cycle.

Some wasps go further controlling their host’s behavior effectively “zombifying” them to help the larva survive. After studying the behavior of ichneumon wasps which lay their eggs in moth larvae naturalist Charles Darwin wrote that they were so evil that they were proof against the idea that God was directing evolution:

“I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent & omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidæ with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars.”

While no wasps are known to lay eggs in humans (although some flies do) they have inspired films like the Alien franchise and the recently released monster survival video game House of Ashes.

Ridley Scott’s 1979 movie ‘Alien’ centered on a parasitic alien species.

But whether inspiring horror or metaphysical questions parasitic wasps also save millions of human lives.

Parasitic wasps to the rescue

In the 1970s the cassava mealybug (Phenacoccus manihoti) entered Western and Central Africa as an invasive pest species from Brazil. It rapidly spread across cassava fields causing crop losses as high as 80 percent. The cassava plant is a staple food crop because it is drought-resistant. The mealybug invasion threatened the food base of 200 million people.

The Swiss entomologist Hans Rudolf Herren who was conducting research in the area found a wasp parasitizing the mealybug (Epidinocarsis lopezi). The parasitic wasp posed little risk to sub-Saharan species.

After rearing the wasps and gathering funding Herren bought planes and coordinated strategic airdrops and ground release of wasp cocoons to areas affected by the mealybug. From those locations the wasp populations grew and spread on their own reducing the mealybug population to manageable levels for years.

This effort saved an estimated 20 million lives billions in crops and avoided the use of pesticides. Herren received the World Food Prize in 1995 for his efforts.

David Attenborough describes the habits of parasitic wasps for BBC Earth.

Biocontrol heroes

Biocontrol is the use of one organism to combat a pest and this was far from the only successful case of wasps as biocontrol. Wasps have successfully defended against many crop pests in Chinese agriculture.

The samurai wasp (Trissolcus japonicus) was being studied for potential use against the brown marmorated stinkbug a threat to many crops across the continental United States. However the wasp preempted this moving into stinkbug territories on its own.

Wasps are even being deployed to prevent moths from damaging historical sites and their artifacts. Here in Canada at least four wasp species have been released to control the emerald ash borer a cause of deforestation across Canada.

Bicontrol: Pros and cons

Biocontrol has several advantages over pesticides.

Populations can grow and spread on their own as demonstrated by the samurai wasps whereas pesticides typically need humans to spread them.

Organisms can maintain their presence over the long term without human intervention while pesticides often require repeat applications.

Pests can also evolve to resist pesticides in as few as 20 generations.

And as biocontrol uses another organism it can evolve in response to the pest’s defenses.

Biocontrol is not free from issues. It often introduces a new invasive species to deal with an existing one. It can be difficult to predict the effects of a new species on an unprepared ecosystem.

For example the cane toad was introduced in Australia to eat several insect pests there. Instead the poisonous toad became a lethal meal for several native species disrupting many other parts of the ecosystems there.

A laughing kookaburra eats a cane toad. Some kookaburras don’t survive ingesting the poisonous toads. Shutterstock

Parasites may avoid some of these issues as unlike predators they are often limited to a single or very few host species making them less likely to go off-target and affect species other than the intended one.

Given that most agricultural pests are insects and most pest insects are targeted by at least one parasitic wasp (there are an estimated 750000 parasitic wasp species) this gives a legion of options to study for safe and effective pest management.

So next time you’re online and see wasps being unfairly maligned consider the millions of humans across the world who are alive and able to feed themselves because of them.

And maybe next Halloween should you encounter the spirit of a certain 1800s English naturalist going on about the theological implications of parasitic wasps’ evil tell him of the good they can do.

This development represents the next piece of the puzzle as we embark on delivering a comprehensive wealth creation platform. Selfwealth members may now access a range of new securities via Chi-X trading while also potentially realising better trading outcomes across familiar ASX stocks. Here more information on Chi-X including common questions below.

What is Chi-X?

Launched in 2011 Chi-X Australia is an alternative trading platform and stock exchange for Australian securities providing efficient and cost-effective access to opportunities both home and abroad.

Chi-X is an ASIC-regulated market operator for executing trades including ASX stocks ETFs and a range of other products like warrants and hybrids. Originally limited to just eight stocks when it first went live Chi-X now offers access to trade the full suite of ASX-listed shares.

The venue accounts for around one-fifth of trading volume in Australian securities with more than $3.8 billion in cash equities trading hands every day.

What Does Chi-X Do?

As an established market operator with a worldwide presence Chi-X also runs trading venues across Europe Asia and North America. It was recently acquired by the third-largest US exchange operator Cboe Global Markets bringing a new level of competition to the local share market.

How to Trade on Chi-X?

Much like when Selfwealth disrupted the retail broker scene with the first CHESS-sponsored flat-fee brokerage model Chi-X represents a level of disruption and competition across an industry that has long been viewed as a monopoly.

To date Chi-X has already helped drive down execution costs within the industry something that originally allowed Selfwealth to offer low-cost brokerage to our members.

However with Chi-X trading now integrated into the Selfwealth share trading platform there are potential benefits for members as far as greater liquidity superior pricing opportunities plus the prospect of future product developments.

What can I trade via Chi-X?

Not only does Chi-X provide access to the thousands of Australian securities that you are likely to already be familiar with but as an alternative stock exchange it also offers trading in a number of unique products as well. Through Chi-X you may trade any of the following:





2000+ ASX-listed stocks

Chi-X specific ETFs

How do I trade through the Chi-X?

The best part about the integration of Chi-X trading into the Selfwealth share trading platform is that it all happens effortlessly behind the scenes and in keeping with the CHESS framework. You do not need to apply for access to Chi-X.

In accordance with the Best Execution Policy of our partner and market participant OpenMarkets we will endeavour to realise the best possible price for your trades. This means that we may automatically route part or all of your order to Chi-X for execution if a superior price is available.

Who Owns Chi-X Australia?

All stocks bought through Chi-X settle via your Selfwealth CHESS HIN as per normal. This is because the ASX still oversees clearing and settlement whereas Chi-X provides an alternative trading venue. As a result you can sell shares bought via Chi-X on the ASX and sell shares bought via the ASX through Chi-X.

With these assurances Selfwealth members should feel confident the introduction of Chi-X trading may help you realise better trading outcomes.

Chi-X Vs ASX: What the Difference?

Since the ASX and Chi-X are separate trading venues prices for the same stock can vary between the two. However given arbitrage opportunities and the prevalence of high-frequency trading by institutions these gaps tend to draw greater trading liquidity and move closer to alignment.

What more Chi-X is a day-only trading venue so orders cannot be left in the market overnight. This may help orders reach the front of the queue sooner than they might on the ASX.

Unlike the ASX there is no pre-market match' nor are there auctions for ASX-listed equity products traded via the Chi-X as participants cannot enter orders into this venue during the pre-market stage and trading runs continuously from 10:00 am to 4:13 pm Sydney-time.

To the delight of dealmakers and moguls the annual Fried Frank holiday party is coming back on Dec. 7 after a year off for the pandemic.

The boozy bash thrown by the law firm’s powerful real estate department and its chairman Jonathan Mechanic has been the property world’s No. 1 celebration since it started 26 years ago at the 21 Club.

“The Fried Frank party is the real estate industry’s equivalent of the Rockefeller Center tree lighting — the official kick-off of the holiday season. And just like Rock Center it feels like the whole world is there jammed together full of good cheer” said CBRE tristate CEO Mary Ann Tighe.

“This year we will especially appreciate it because we’ll all be celebrating that our city made it to the other side of the pandemic” she said.

3 It shall be again: Waiters line up to serve guests at Fried Frank’s gala in 2018. Facebook

The event grew so popular that Mechanic moved it to the larger St. Regis Roof and then to immense Cipriani at 110 E. 42nd St. in 2004. We once likened the din raised by 1300 industry machers in the cavernous banking hall to the roar of an express train.

When the pandemic sidelined the event last year Mechanic commissioned a jigsaw puzzle from images of past years’ revels and sold them for charity.

He said of the real thing’s return “It kicks off the holiday season and of course year-end deal making. Hosting this event is a reflection of our commitment to the real estate industry and the resurgence of New York City. We are back — albeit with appropriate health and safety protocols in place including a smaller guest list requirements for proof of vaccination and COVID testing.”

He wouldn’t say how much smaller but any shrinkage is likely to inflame the frenzy for invitations. Guests won’t have to wear masks although Cipriani staff will.

The event always mirrored the mood of the times — from post-9/11 gloom to ebullience in years through 2019 when fortunes were made on new developments giant leases and $1 billion building sales.

It drew developers Larry Silverstein Douglas Durst Harry Macklowe Bill Rudin David W. Levinson Stephen Ross and Steven Roth superbrokers Mary Ann Tighe Stephen B. Siegel John Cefaly and Mitch Konsker investment-sale wizards Doug Harmon Darcy Stacom and Woody Heller and corporate honchos Dennis Friedrich Ric Clark and Mike Fascitelli who joked to Mechanic that if the party got any bigger “You’ll have to move it to the Javits Center.”

Realty Check witnessed many memorable smiles over the years such as Harry Macklowe’s after Jamestown invested $300 million in his GM Building and Rob Speyer beaming over great reviews for his new Top of the Rock Observation Deck.

There were awkward moments too such as Kent Swig dodging reporters when he was besieged by debt and a costly divorce from Macklowe’s daughter Liz.

After last year’s dark interlude the show will return — with Mechanic back as ringmaster greeting everyone arriving at the front of the room.

There’s no end in sight to the city’s residential-construction boom. Despite the alleged “exodus” from the city — much of which turned out to be false — developers are all but tripping over each other to put up new apartment buildings.

Interestingly very few of them will be of the supertall class that came to define the pre-pandemic boom.



As reported by real estate construction tracker YIMBY Department of Buildings filings for the second and third quarters of 2021 reveal that 19052 new residential units are coming in more than 1000 new buildings. The YIMBY tally counted 45 projects of at least 10 stories 268 of four to nine stories and 720 of one to three stories.



The site called it a “testament to the industry’s enduring enthusiasm” about the Big Apple market. It said that if all the new projects were “built together as a single cluster they would comprise something of a small city by themselves complete with a dozen or more blocks of low-rise houses and a sizable urban core with over 200 mid-rise buildings” YIMBY said.

Meanwhile sales of existing residential real estate recently reached a three-decade high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vcHJlbWl1bS5nb2F1dG8uY29tLmF1L2RlYWxlcnNoaXAtbGFuZC1wcmljZXMtc29hci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dealership land prices soar,"A SECOND Ford Melbourne dealership property is on the market with agents predicting strong interest following the substantial $32.6 million received for the land occupied by Chadstone Ford and Hyundai.

The Etheridge Ford site in Ringwood is expected to attract a solid list of prospective buyers who missed out on the Chadstone site and agents said it is set for a sale price of more than $19 million.

Importantly Etheridge Ford’s property is regarded as being one of the last available large blocks in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs.

Aside from an ongoing lease for the Ford dealership through to 2028 the site is a substantial 14084 square metres which offers buyers scope for diverse developments including subdivision while retaining a car dealership multi-storey apartment complexes and in line with adjoining occupiers health-care businesses.

The property comprises a showroom offices mezzanine workshop retail front and reception canopy. Annual net income is $755478 per annum.

It also has a commercial-2 zoning with a low 25 per cent site coverage. The lease expires in seven years and has no options indicating there is substantial future development potential.

Agents said that Ringwood also has a 34 per cent population growth over the next 20 years. Assisting the forecast population growth is the location of the Eastland Shopping Centre Ringwood Square Shopping Centre and Eastlink Freeway within 3.4km of the property.

The Etheridge Ford site at 495 Maroondah Highway in Ringwood is being sold through co-agents Burgess Rawson and CBRE.

Burgess Rawson partner Billy Holderhead told GoAutoNews Premium that land in the suburb was definitely becoming harder to get.

“Investors and developers are circling and looking for large blue-chip locations with excellent future development opportunities exactly like Ford Ringwood” he said.

“This site gives the buyer the opportunity to unlock the land for development in line with what is happening in neighbouring properties.

“Current projects in the precinct are condensing dealership showrooms onto much smaller components of highway frontage sites and unlocking rear land for alternative developments.

“As an example the new BMW dealership now under construction for Autosport Group has a three level showroom and three level basement on a site of just 1625 square metres.

“That site will be worth around $35 million on completion.

“Recently approved right next door to BMW is a new five level showroom/office development with four levels of basement car parking.

“This sort of intensification is a trend that is becoming more common in the inner suburbs of Melbourne Sydney and Brisbane.

“We are also seeing the multi-purpose functions such as a car showroom on the ground and/or first level and offices or apartments above.

“The Etheridge site is over 14000 square metres so could easily accommodate a new dealership at the front and say a health care precinct business park or self storage facility at the rear.”

The Etheridge Ford site is being sold by Geoff Sammons who with business partner Coopersmith Group is a long-term owner of the property. Mr Sammons and Coopersmith were also owners of the Ringwood Mazda dealership that sold in two parts in September and November.

Mr Sammons told GoAutoNews Premium that the Etheridge Ford dealership jointly owned by his family interests and those of the Coopersmith family was built by Coopersmith in 2002 before being sold in 2007 then repurchased by the families in 2014 and is now being sold as part of a retirement of assets.

Mr Holderhead said that interest in the property was especially high following the sale of the Ford and Hyundai dealerships in Oakleigh which sold last month for the record price of $32.6 million by Burgess Rawson and Gross Waddell ICR achieving a yield of 3.32 per cent.

CBRE associate director Nathan Mufale said the Etheridge Ford site had all the fundamentals – “scale; great access and exposure; and favourable planning controls.”

“As a premium property we expect top end investors to take a long look at this one” said Mr Mufale.

“Interest in high performing car dealerships is certainly strong so all eyes will be on Ford Ringwood as a hugely successful family owned and operated business trading strongly for over 30 years” Mr Mufale said.

The Etheridge Ford property is for sale by expressions of interest closing at 3pm AEDT on Friday November 26 2021.

OnePeterFive has come into the possession of the following letter from the Vatican Prefect of the Congregation of Divine Worship Archbishop Arthur Roche in response to an inquiry shortly after Traditionis Custodes was promulgated. We publish the inquiry and the Vatican response below followed by commentary from our contributing editor Dr. Joseph Shaw chairman of the Latin Mass Society of England and Wales as well as president of Fœderatio Internationalis Una Voce. He is also mentioned in the inquiry.

With due respect to His Excellency and His Eminence we feel compelled by our vows at baptism and the principles of the saints and the Magisterium to make public this correspondence for the common good of the Mystical Body of Christ and many souls throughout the world.

We direct readers to the recent volume compiled by contributing editor Dr. Peter Kwasniewski entitled From Benedict’s Peace to Francis’s War which includes the responses of five cardinals and five bishops to Traditionis Custodes besides other clerics and laypeople casting into grave doubt the claim made by the Holy Father that the desire for the ancient Roman Rite is “tied more to the desire and wishes of individual priests than to the real need of the ‘holy People of God.’” This text will help serve the Church in presenting the faithful with the salient issues at play instead of the misunderstandings lamentably contained in the motu proprio and its accompanying letter.

Let us piously invoke Our Immaculate Lady Mary Mother of the Church for all hierarchs especially the Roman Pontiff to hear the cry of their sheep seeking spiritual food; that our shepherds may lay down their lives for the sheep after the model given by Our Good Shepherd with Whose Precious Blood shed at Calvary we commune at the Most Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.

Commentary

By Joseph Shaw PhD

President Fœderatio Internationalis Una Voce

Chairman Latin Mass Society of England and Wales

These two letters have been going around by email for some time and it was inevitable that they would be published (it seems Gloria.tv was the first). They have been offered to OnePeterFive and since they are now going to be seen by everyone I can comment on them publicly. Some of the contents are a little technical and obscure but none of it should surprise us the basic message is positive and it also gives us a chance to respond to arguments currently being developed to limit what we can do.

In his letter Cardinal Nichols asks for clarification on a series of detailed issues from the Curial institution which now has authority in the area the Congregation for Divine Worship (CDW). Archbishop Roche the English Prefect of the CDW replies sometimes in a slightly vague way since these were early days in the interpretation of Traditionis Custodes. Some things are not settled; others are not to be settled at all but left to bishops’ discretion.

The most interesting questions are these.

Other Sacraments

Cardinal Nichols’ question (b) asks about the ‘other sacraments’: marriage baptism and so on. If the “previous norms” which permitted them have been abolished where does that leave them? It is a reasonable question since they are not mentioned in Traditionis Custodes. The CDW’s response however is not cut and dried. It implies that a “full implementation” of TC would end the provision of the other sacraments: this is not surprising as TC aspires to end the celebration of the ancient Mass and it would be odd if the other sacraments continued after that had come to pass. This is immediately qualified however by the need for pastoral sensitivity. Then at the top of the second page of the letter is a passage rather difficult to follow but which appears to be criticising the way these matters have developed up to now as going beyond what was really permitted.

Archbishop Roche may like to refresh his memory of the documents setting up the different Traditional Priestly Institutes who were explicitly given permission to offer the other sacraments according to the old books. Thus on 10th September 1988 the Fraternity of St Peter was given this privilege:

In virtue of the faculty granted to it by the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei concedes to that which is called the “Fraternity of St. Peter” founded July 18 1988 and declared of “Pontifical Right” by the Holy See the faculty of celebrating Mass and carrying out the rites of the sacraments and other sacred acts as well as fulfilling the Divine Office according to the typical edition of the liturgical books in force in the year 1962; namely the Missal Ritual Pontifical and Roman Breviary. This faculty may be used in their own churches or oratories; otherwise it may only be used with the consent of the Ordinary of the place except for the celebration of private Masses. Anything to the contrary not withstanding.

There are more examples here. This document of course has not been abrogated since it does not conflict with the provisions of Traditionis Custodes (see Article 8).

Lectionary and Calendar

Under points (c) and (d) the CDW affirms that the ancient Mass has a lectionary and a calendar proper to it and that these should be respected. Vernacular readings (which I would add should not replace the proclamation of the readings in Latin) should correspond to the liturgical texts and not to what the Novus Ordo lectionary happens to provide.

Groups

Point (e) addresses the question of what constitutes a ‘group.’ The Latin Mass Society’s Canonical Guidance on TC suggested that the term must refer to formally instituted entities as they are said in the text to be “instituted” by bishops and to have a common identity settled views about Vatican II and so on. The CDW suggests something similar: they are “personal parishes” and “gatherings of people who have been regularly meeting” for the Old Mass. It does not include therefore people who just happen to turn up for Mass. It follows that a priest can choose say a Vetus Ordo Mass one day (if he has a general permission from his bishop to celebrate the “antecedent liturgy”) for all comers without worrying about the restrictions listed in TC Article 3 which only apply to “groups”.

English Indult

It’s not clear why Cardinal Nichols is asking about the English Indult whose fiftieth anniversary was yesterday 5th November. That neither the archive of the Archdiocese of Westminster nor that of the Congregation for Divine Worship has kept a record of this is a poor showing: though certainly not the fault of the two prelates. They can rest assured that the Latin Mass Society has kept a record and you can see the letter giving the Indult dated and with its Protocol Number on our website. It is also recorded in Annibale Bugnini’s own book The Reform of the Liturgy 1948-1975 on pages 297-8 in the English edition.

Honestly Your Eminence and Your Excellency we didn’t just make this up!

Conclusions

Cardinal Nichols is very aware of the ultimate stated aim of TC: the complete cessation of celebrations of the ancient Mass. Archbishop Roche however puts the stress on the need for “a delicacy of care and direction”: the old Mass “has been regulated and not supressed.” This is unequivocal good news and we must not allow any negative phrasing in these letters to distract us from that.

The Latin Mass Society like Una Voce groups around the world and the Una Voce Federation which represents them “promotes” the Vetus Ordo. In the current climate we cannot expect the official organs of the Holy See to approve of this activity: though they did up to a few months ago. We will see how long it is until the attitude changes again. In the meantime we will continue to argue for what we think is right with due respect for persons as is our right and duty as Catholics (see Canon 225).",,,,,,,,,,,,

The West Ashley school's motto is ""Where great minds grow"" and its website is filled with photos of teachers instructing students on various yoga positions on sunlit grass lawns. It boasted of an excellent academic program and a family-like atmosphere. On top of all that the parents praised the school for how it handled the COVID-19 pandemic over the past couple years. It seemed like the perfect place for Dellenbach to send her son to kindergarten.

But as the delta variant spread through South Carolina over the summer Orange Grove parents grew increasingly concerned. Many knew that state politicians had passed a law saying school districts that instituted mask mandates risked losing their funding for the year. But charter schools operated in a murky area where they were not ruled by the same regulations as other public schools. Several charter schools announced that they were requiring masks in schools but Orange Grove administrators remained quiet.

Eventually Orange Grove parents learned that while the school was going to encourage students to wear masks they were not going to mandate it. The board did not even institute a mandate after Charleston County School District started enforcing one for all public schools in the region in direct defiance to legislators orders.

State law requires charter schools to ""adhere to the same health safety civil rights and disability rights requirements as are applied to public schools operating in the same school district."" However Orange Grove's board Chair Jennifer Mieras said that the provision in the 2021-22 budget that prevents districts from enforcing mask mandates supersedes that law.

""We're really not trying to focus on the parents we're focused on following the law"" Mieras told The Post and Courier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvbm92LzA3L2xpdHRsZS1yb2NrLWJhc2VkLWxpc2EtYWNhZGVteS1jaGFydGVyLXNjaG9vbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Little Rock-based LISA Academy charter schools plan three schools for Fayetteville | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"The LISA Academy Public Charter Schools system the largest charter system in the state in terms of campus numbers is again looking to expand -- this time into Fayetteville.

The charter system is seeking final approval from the Arkansas Board of Education at its 10 a.m. Wednesday meeting to open three schools in north Fayetteville starting with elementary grades in August 2023. The middle school for grades six through eight would open in August 2024 and the high school would follow in August 2026.

The proposal -- which would be an amendment to LISA Academy's state-issued charter -- includes a request to increase the system's student enrollment cap over the next nine years by 1168 students from 5632 to 6800. The system's current enrollment is about 3600.

The state's Charter Authorizing Panel reviewed the amendment proposal last month and approved it with no member of the public or representatives of the surrounding or nearby school districts speaking in opposition to it.

The Education Board has the authority now to either accept the charter panel's recommendation or conduct its own review of the proposal before making a final decision.

All three of the proposed schools would be housed in two newly constructed buildings at West Van Asche and South McGuire streets.

LISA Academy Public Charter Schools will lease the buildings from KLS II Leasing which will construct and own the buildings. KLS an affiliate of the Walton Family Foundation will charge the system 12% of the state funding that the three schools receive.

KLS is currently constructing buildings for LISA Academy elementary middle and high schools on one site in Rogers. The Rogers location will open to elementary pupils in August with a middle school and high school to follow. The Rogers site on Horsebarn Road was selected because of its accessibility to Rogers and Bentonville.

[DOCUMENT: Read the LISA Academy proposal » arkansasonline.com/117lisa/]

Luanne Baroni assistant superintendent and director of communications for the LISA Academy charter system said last week that system leaders were attracted to the idea of opening schools at the north Fayetteville site in part because of the growing population in the area and because the site would be accessible to families in Fayetteville and Springdale.

LISA Academy already operates a kindergarten-through-eighth-grade school in Springdale.

""We wanted it to be accessible to Springdale because parents at our Springdale campus would really like a high school for their students to attend"" Baroni said about the Fayetteville site.

That Springdale school started out as the Ozark Montessori Charter School but it struggled to operate. The Little Rock-based LISA Academy initially partnered with Ozark Montessori and ultimately acquired the campus to make it part of the LISA system.

""We had received multiple inquiries over the years asking if we were going to expand and build a system [in Northwest Arkansas]"" Baroni said. ""Our Springdale school came about because there was a struggling school that needed help and so we helped them. That was successful there and so we felt comfortable in going ahead with moving ahead with future plans for that part of the state.""

The proposed location of the LISA schools in Fayetteville had prompted questions from Charter Authorizing Panel member Naccaman Williams of Springdale.

Williams complimented the charter school leaders for their academic program but said the planned site is not close to residential areas. He wondered how school operators would attract a racially and ethnically diverse student body.

""This is extremely north Fayetteville"" he told his panel colleagues. ""It's far from where a diverse population lives"" in either Springdale or Fayetteville. ""It's almost in the middle of nowhere.""

""You are going to have to have a really good recruitment plan to get a diverse enrollment"" Williams told the school planners.

Hasan Sazci assistant superintendent and principal of LISA Academy's Springdale campus told Williams that the site is close to Interstate 49 and Arkansas 71-B as well as to Washington Regional Medical Center and the Northwest Arkansas Mall among other businesses. Sazci said the site is within 20 minutes of residential centers -- even Farmington south of Fayetteville.

Baroni told Williams that the system is already working with a professional advertising agency to make sure recruitment efforts will reach all of the different population groups.

She also noted that early plans for LISA Academy Elementary West in Little Rock had raised similar concerns about attracting students from minority groups but that the school now has the highest minority population and the highest level of students from low income families in the charter system.

""We were very persistent"" she said about recruitment to the school in west Little Rock.

LISA Academy Superintendent Fatih Bogrek told the panel that school bus transportation for the Fayetteville schools is a possibility if there is a demand for it.

In addition to the Springdale campus and the soon-to-open campuses in Rogers the LISA Academy system has three charter schools in Little Rock and three in Sherwood. This school year the system began the Arkansas Hybrid School which is headquartered in Little Rock.",,,,,,,,,

My family and I have really taken to the area and I can't really imagine living any place else. It is kind of crazy however. Since we got here it has been nothing but a world of extremes. If you remember the summer and fall of 19 it rained just about everyday. Farmers couldn't get their crops out of the fields because it was way too wet. Then we entered the world of COVID-19 and now the polar opposites for weather. We've never been dryer and farmers may not have anything to harvest because of the drought.

Updated May 10 2024

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is sending humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent rains in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.

In what authorities consider the state’s worst-ever crisis caused by natural disasters the extreme flooding has forced 200000 people out of their homes and at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing.

The Brazil Area Presidency has assembled staff and resources to assist those affected by the floods. A letter sent to bishops and stake presidents from Elder Joni L. Koch Brazil Area President and his counselors Elder Arnulfo Valenzuela and Elder Mark D. Eddy all General Authority Seventies states that 21 meetinghouses are now being used as shelters for evacuated people and thousands of basic food packages provided by the Church to the state Civil Defense have already begun to be distributed to the population.

Other humanitarian aid initiatives are underway in close coordination with the government to help the community. The Church’s Welfare and Self-Reliance and Family Services departments are coordinating support and efforts to meet the needs of members as well.

On Wednesday May 8 missionaries from the Church helped unload emergency supplies from an Azul airplane at the military airport in the city of Canoas.

In Saõ Paulo on Thursday May 9 Elder Koch and Elder Valenzuela closely monitored the loading onto an Azul aircraft of 6 tons of supplies purchased by the Church for flood victims bound for the Canoas Air Base. In a social media post on the Church’s official Brazil account the leaders stated that in addition to the donations was “an immeasurable amount of love and sincere prayers for the people of Rio Grande do Sul.” On Friday May 10 Brazil’s first lady Rosângela Lula da Silva wrote her Instagram page: “I want to thank Azul [Airlines] and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who performed alongside FAB [Brazilian Air Force] and were able to get the donations we received to Canoas. ... There were mattresses vacuum cleaners toilet kits blankets among other items.” She said Brazil is united in its support of Rio Grande do Sul.

News reports say some 80% of the population is without running water right now a week into the flooding. Many also do not have telephone or internet services.

The airport bus station and main roads are all blocked or closed going into the capital of Porto Alegre — and more than two-thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state are affected by the flood waters. Field hospitals have been set up to help those affected.

Social media posts on the Church’s Autossuficiência Brasil and Brazil Area accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints further explain how the Church is responding to the disaster which include the following list of donated goods and services:

5000-plus basic food baskets

5000-plus mattresses pillows bedding and blankets

48000 liters of drinking water

5000 hygiene and cleaning kits

400 water filters

Additional humanitarian funds

These donations are being coordinated in collaboration with the State Civil Defense. Local church leaders are also coordinating efforts to help the community.

“[T]he Brazil Area office is mobilized to do everything possible to help and help the population of Rio Grande do Sul our dear brothers and sisters and friends at this time of great sorrow” the post said in Portuguese.

The post states that Church members who want to make donations to those affected by the calamity can do so through official government organizations that are coordinating donations through civil defense and social funds.

In addition the Church’s Family Services department is coordinating a support network of volunteer psychologists to provide emotional support to those affected. And wards and stakes across the country have joined the Church’s Helping Hands volunteer program and are raising donations.

A statement from the Brazil Area presidency said “We pray that as we follow the perfect example of Jesus Christ ‘our hands may become His hands; our eyes His eyes and our hearts His heart’ at this time when our brothers and sisters need us so much.”

Some of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul — roughly the size Ecuador — were already suffering from at least three previous major floods in less than eight months.

The rains are expected to continue in the area along with high winds.

And for more than 20 of those years it’s celebrated spring with a day of fun open to all.

That tradition will continue May 18 when the church hosts its annual Spring Fest. The event which kicks off at 10 a.m. will include free hot dogs and chips kids’ crafts balloon animals and face painting.

As if that wasn’t fun enough there will be puppies too. The Loving Eyes Seeing Eye Puppy Club which raises and trains puppies to become service dogs for people who are blind will also participate. The volunteer-run club works with puppies that are 8 weeks to 14 months old to socialize them and teach them basic skills before they graduate to official training. Representatives will share more about the organization’s mission at Spring Fest and guests will get to meet (and pet) some of the dogs.

The festival is just one example of how the church connects with its neighbors.

“We are more than a church we are part of the community” longtime volunteer Chris Kimmich says.

That mission will continue with several special events this year including the new Chocolate Chip Cookie Concert Series which began earlier this month to coincide with Lancaster city’s First Friday celebrations. Each event will feature a different musical act and will host artisans in the church’s parking lot where free parking is available.

There will also be a special Covenant Church Homecoming weekend Oct. 4-6 at the church featuring a Friday night concert Saturday night dinner and Sunday service.

“Recognizing our 140-year legacy as a vital part of the community will help us build on a bright future” says the Rev. Derrick Gutierrez the church’s pastor.

“Covenant has a long history of music and food” adds Jenny Engle who says she has been “driving people nuts” volunteering at the church since 1980.

History of caring

Founded in 1884 Covenant United Methodist Church has a history of outreach work. The church provides a broad range of services to residents throughout the year including free clothing from its community closet before school programs for children attending nearby Fulton Elementary School free food boxes meeting space grief support family fun nights and shut-in/hospital visitation and support.

A few years ago Kimmich says she noticed school children waiting outside “in the cold” for the school to open so the church started a day care for students. They also frequently set up a table on the street to offer snacks pencils and even dog treats to passersby.

At the heart of the church’s work lies its mission outlined in the church’s “Living Legacy” anniversary brochure: “We invite welcome nurture and serve children individuals and families through our worship services and ministries.”

“It’s about building a community to love God love on another and deal with tough questions in life” Gutierrez says.

He says the church is there to help navigate the different stages of life from raising a family to retirement.

“We are here to grow people in their faith” Kimmich says.

And sometimes that starts at the very beginning of their journey.

“For those interested we introduce them to their faith” Engle says.

Gutierrez who grew up in Lancaster says the church is committed to serving its diverse community in the city. While Sunday services are in English other communications are in Spanish with more languages to be added in time.

MUSIC TO YOUR EARS As part of its 140th anniversary celebration Covenant United Methodist Church will host a Chocolate Chip Cookie Concert Series on the first Friday of each month at 6 p.m. in its parking lot. The concerts coincide with the citywide First Friday activities; parking is available.

Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

Ia memilih membahas dalam kegiatan Bincang Buku dan Monolog yang dipusatkan di Benteng Amsterdam Negeri Hila Kecamatan Leihitu Kabupaten Maluku Tengah Jumat (5/11/2021).

Kegiatan tersebut dihadiri langsung oleh Wakil Ketua MPR RI Lestari Moerdijat Gubernur Maluku Murad Ismail Ina Latu Maluku Widya Pratiwi Murad Ismail Hasto Kastiyanto (Kandidat Doktor Pertahanan) A Luthfi Assyaukarie (Akademisi Universitas Paramadina) dan Alohiab Watloly (Akademisi Universitas Pattimura).

Connie mengatakan buku yang ditulis dengan gaya bahasa sastra romantis ""Kepak Cinta Pengawal Langit"" merupakan karya kolaborasinya dan penyair Bara Pattyradja yang mengisahkan kehidupan tokoh fiktif perempuan bernama Illuvia

""Bagaimana bangsa ini harus dibangun ke masa depan karena judulnya kepak cinta karena membangun kekuatan angkatan udara selain berbicara juga tentang kekuatan angkatan laut. Namun kekuatan cinta itu penting. Jadi saya bawa kesana kata-katanya tetapi lebih banyak memesankan tentang kebangkitan kemandirian perempuan membangun kekuatan angkatan udara"" ungkapnya.

Dijelaskan novel dengan tebal 230 halaman ini juga dibumbui sekelumit cerita pertahanan dan keamanan nasional maupun sejarah tentang tokoh-tokoh perempuan Indonesia masa lalu yang memiliki peran penting dalam kebangkitan bangsa.

“Novel ini banyak berbicara tentang sejarah kehebatan kaum perempuan dan rasa kemandirian mereka serta bagaimana membangun masa depan bangsa melalui kekuatan angkatan udara” jelasnya.

Baginya Novel ini sengaja ditulis dengan bahasa sastra romantis agar lebih mudah dan lebih menarik menjangkau generasi muda sebagai calon pemimpin masa depan agar kemudian dapat belajar mengenai pertahanan dan keamanan nasional dan ikut membangun bangsa.

Rahakundini mengaku kagun dan sangat terinspirasi dengan Maluku. Baginya saat ini wilayah timur didalamnya adalah Maluku jarang dilihat padahal wilayah timur memiliki kearifan lokal.

""Belum ke Maluku saja sudah jadi inspirasi dan apalagi sudah ke Maluku. Kenapa ke sini karena Indonesia Timur jarang dilihat. Saya ingin adanya kearifan lokal. Kita ditanah adat harus menanamkan adat. Nilai-nilai ini yang ingin saya tanamkan diseluruh Indonesia. Kita boleh menyerap dari Eropa Amerika dan lainnya tetapi jangan lupa kearifan lokal kita harus ada dan karena itu kekuatan kita"" ungkapnya.

Saat ini kata Rahakundini sebanyak 5.000 eksemplar novel “Kepak Cinta Pengawal Langit” telah habis dibagikan. Saat ini akan dicetak lagi 5.000 eksemplar untuk dijual ke pasaran dan diberikan juga kepada Pemerintah Provinsi (Pemprov) Maluku.

Bagi yang ingin belajar tentang cinta dan kesetiaan sosok Sayyidah Zainab Binti Muhammad Rasulullah adalah teladannya. Kisahnya dapat dijadikan pelajaran dan lebih menginspirasi daripada kisah sinetron ataupun film-film kekinian.Beliaulah sosok perempuan teguh dan sejati istri paling setia terhadap suami. Zainab merupakan putri tertua dari Rasulullah shallallahu 'alaihi wasallam. Lahir saat Rasulullah berusia 30 tahun. Simak kisahnya.Ketika memasuki usia yang layak untuk menikah Sayyidah Zainab dilamar oleh Halah binti Khuwailid (bibi dari ibundanya) untuk dijodohkan dengan anaknya yang bernama Abu al-'Ash bin Rabi'.Pinangan ini diterima dan Sayyidah Zainab pun menikah dengan Abu al-'Ash. Dari pernikahan mereka Zainab dikaruniai dua orang anak Ali dan Umamah. Pernikahan Zainab ini terjadi sebelum ayahnya diangkat menjadi Rasul.Ketika Rasulullah menerima wahyu Zainab termasuk orang yang pertama kali mengimaninya. Namun tidak demikian dengan suaminya. Abu al-'Ash tetap sulit meninggalkan agama nenek moyangnya hingga akhirnya tali pernikahan itu tidak dapat dipertahankan. Zainab memilih Islam sedangkan suaminya tetap dalam kemusyrikan.Abu al-'Ash kemudian bergabung dalam pasukan kaum Quraisy yang memerangi Rasulullah. Dalam perang Badar Abu al-Ash tertangkap dan menjadi tawanan umat Islam. Suasana pun menjadi tegang karena menantu Rasulullah menjadi tawanan perang.Dalam situasi seperti itu kaum kafir Quraisy mengirimkan utusan untuk menukar Abu al-Ash dengan tawanan yang lain. Tidak ketinggalan pula Zainab beliau juga mengirimkan kalung hadiah pernikahan dari ibunya untuk menebus Abu al-Ash. Ia adalah suami yang paling dicintainya.Tatkala Rasulullah melihat kalung milik Zainab yang merupakan hadiah dari ibunya (Sayyidah Khadijah Al-Kubro) hati beliau merasa iba. Lalu beliau bersabda: ""Wahai kaum muslimin jika kalian dapat melepaskan tawanan bernama Abu al-Ash ibn Rabi' serta mengembalikan tebusannya kepada Zainab maka silakan kalian melakukannya.""Mendengar sabda Rasulullah para sahabat kemudian menjawab: ""Ya Rasulullah kami bisa melepaskan tawanan tersebut."" Abu al-Ash pun dilepaskan dan tebusannya dikembalikan kepada Zainab. Ketika dilepas Rasulullah mengambil janji dari Abu al-Ash untuk menceraikan Zainab dan ia boleh bersama Zainab kembali apabila ia mau memeluk Islam. Namun ternyata Abu al-Ash tetap bersikukuh pada kemusyrikannya.Setelah dilepas Abu al-‘Ash kembali ke Makkah. Ia merelakan Zainab untuk dikembalikan kepada ayahnya Rasulullah di Madinah dengan diantar Kinanah ibn Rabi' (saudara kandung Abu al-Ash ibn Rabi’). Di tengah perjalanan di daerah Zi Tuwa mereka dihadang oleh kaum kafir Quraisy yang dipimpin oleh Hubar ibn Aswad dan Nafi’ ibn Abdulqais.Hubar mendorong Zainab hingga terjatuh dari sekedup untanya. Padahal saat itu Zainab sedang hamil hingga ia mengalami pendarahan dan kandungannya gugur.Zainab resmi berpisah dari suaminya. Abu al-Ash berdomisili di Makkah sedangkan Zainab di Madinah. Keduanya sangat bersedih atas perpisahan yang terjadi. Enam tahun lamanya Zainab hidup bersama Rasulullah di Madinah. Selama itu pula ia tidak pernah berhenti berdoa agar kiranya Allah berkenan melapangkan hati Abu Al-Ash untuk menerima Islam.Sampai suatu saat pada bulan Jumadil Ula Tahun ke-6 Hijriyah Abu al-Ash keluar untuk berdagang ke Syam. Ketika hendak kembali pulang di tengah perjalanan ia bertemu dengan pasukan Rasulullah lalu mereka meminta semua harta yang dibawa dan ia pun kemudian menyerahkannya.Dengan demikian habislah semua harta Abu al-'Ash dan harta orang lain yang dibawanya. Ia tidak dapat mengembalikan amanah yang diserahkan kepadanya. Semua hartanya telah habis sementara orang-orang yang menitipkan dagangan menunggu kepulangannya.Dalam suasana galau ia teringat kepada Zainab yang sangat mencintai serta setia kepada dirinya. Ia pun masuk ke Kota Madinah secara sembunyi-sembunyi pada waktu malam dan meminta kepada Zainab untuk memberikan perlindungan kepadanya serta menolong untuk mengembalikan hartanya.Zainab pun memberikan perlindungan kepadanya. Beliau menunjukkan sosok perempuan sejati dan akhlak terpuji. Tak ada dendam kesumat dan kebencian bersarang di hatinya.Ketika tiba waktu fajar umat Islam berduyun-duyun pergi ke masjid. Rasulullah mengumandangkan takbir dan umat Islam pun bertakbir pula bersama beliau. Tiba-tiba dari balik dinding terdengar suara ""Hai orang-orang sesungguhnya aku telah melindungi Abu al-'Ash. Ia sekarang berada dalam perlindungan dan pengamananku."" Ternyata suara itu adalah suara Zainab putri Rasulullah.Seusai sholat Rasulullah langsung menghadap para jamaah seraya bersabda: ""Wahai kaum muslimin adakah kalian mendengar suara sebagaimana yang aku dengar? Sesungguhnya Zainab adalah orang yang paling pantas memberikan perlindungan kepadanya.""Kemudian Rasulullah menemui putrinya lalu berpesan: ""Wahai putriku hormatilah kedudukan Abu al-'Ash. Sebab tidak ada jalan baginya untuk lepas begitu saja serta dirimu sama sekali tidak halal baginya selama ia masih musyrik.""Pada tahun ke-7 Hijriyah Abu al-Ash datang kembali ke Madinah dalam keadaan telah memeluk Islam. Ia pergi sebagai Muhajir yang kemudian dipersatukan kembali dengan Zainab dalam hubungan pernikahan yang Islami.Rasulullah sangat kagum dengan kesetiaan Zainab kepada suami yang telah lama berpisah serta telah memutuskan syahwat terhadapnya demi memenuhi perintah Allah. Namun demikian ia tetap bersikap baik dan setia memberikan pertolongan kepadanya. Sayyidah Zainab wafat pada Tahun 8 Hijriyah dan dimakamkan di Jannatul Baqi Madinah. Beliau telah mengukir keteladanan yang indah yakni kesetiaan seorang istri kepada suami ketulusan cinta dan keteguhan iman.Buku ""25 Perempuan Teladan"" karya Hj Umma Farida Lc MA",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhc2lhbmEuY29tL3JhaW5lc2lhLzYxODYwYmJlMDYzMTBlMTJmZDZlNjAwMi9wdWlzaS1qdXJhbmctYmVuY2ktZGFuLWNpbnRh0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29tcGFzaWFuYS5jb20vYW1wL3JhaW5lc2lhLzYxODYwYmJlMDYzMTBlMTJmZDZlNjAwMi9wdWlzaS1qdXJhbmctYmVuY2ktZGFuLWNpbnRh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Puisi: Jurang Benci dan Cinta - Kompasiana.com,"Benci...

Indians and Indian Americans are often held up as a “model minority” in the United States. Members of this community are more likely to be highly educated and to have health insurance make more money work in more senior positions and have lower rates of poverty than both the average immigrant and the average American. They are well represented in science technology engineering and mathematics—the so-called STEM subjects—and more and more of them occupy roles of political and social influence including Vice President Kamala Harris. This group so the narrative goes exhibits the promise of the American dream.

But two lawsuits in the past year as well as two surveys have offered a clearer picture of this particular minority group warts and all finding evidence that many members of the community have imported the specifically Hindu Indian notion of casteism to America. The vocabulary may be unfamiliar to most Americans—Dalits Brahmans Adivasis for example—but underlying it is a familiar and corrosive subject: discrimination.

In July 2020 California regulators sued the tech company Cisco Systems over alleged discrimination toward an Indian engineer by his Indian colleagues while all of them were working in the state. According to the complaint the engineer’s co-workers who are upper-caste Hindus “outed” him in the workplace as a Dalit pejoratively known as the “untouchable” caste and argued that he had gained entry to the Indian Institute of Technology one of India’s most prestigious universities only as a result of affirmative action. (India has banned caste discrimination but does hold a certain number of places at public universities for Dalit and other lower-caste applicants.) The lawsuit claims that Cisco did not sufficiently address the aggrieved employee’s concerns and in fact sidelined him treatment that violates the Civil Rights Act and California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act. The company denies the allegations and though a spokesperson did not respond to my requests for comment Cisco has said in a statement that it will “vigorously defend itself.”

Then in May of this year a federal lawsuit alleged that a Hindu organization Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha lured more than 200 lower-caste workers to the U.S. and forced them to work for as little as $1.20 an hour for several years to build a sprawling Hindu temple in New Jersey. Speaking with The New York Times when the lawsuit was filed BAPS’s chief executive Kanu Patel said “I respectfully disagree with the wage claim.” In response to my own questions an organization spokesperson said that those who had helped build the temple were “artisan volunteers” who were “treated equally and with respect.” The spokesperson said that BAPS had worked in lower-caste communities of India “to help them integrate and succeed.”

The two cases both of which remain unresolved are extreme examples of what continues to be an everyday phenomenon in the Indian and Indian American community in the U.S.

I am Indian and have spent the past year in the U.S. initially at Harvard University as a Nieman Fellow and then in Silicon Valley. On the East Coast I met some of the brightest minds in the Indian diaspora and the West Coast is packed with my compatriots as well as longer-established Indian Americans.

But like all stereotypes the one about the overachieving Indian or Indian American is at best incomplete flattening a community of several million people. Though most Indians and Indian Americans are Hindu a substantial number are Muslim Sikh or Christian (as well as followers of a host of other religions) and have moved to the U.S. from across India. Similarly to many other minority groups in the U.S. they suffer from racial discrimination battle against stereotypes and—despite their prominence in STEM fields—are underrepresented in large parts of the economy. And while they may represent the economic promise of the American dream they do not appear to have taken hold of its deeper underpinning at least according to survey data.

A 2016 study by Equality Labs an American civil-rights organization focused on caste found that 41 percent of South-Asian Americans who identify as lower-caste reported facing caste discrimination in U.S. schools and universities compared with 3 percent of upper-caste respondents. The survey indicated that 67 percent of lower-caste respondents said they had suffered caste discrimination in the workplace versus 1 percent of upper-caste individuals. (The survey of more than 1500 people focused on Hindus. Though upper castes hold more power caste discrimination is more complex than simply being meted out by upper castes against lower castes Thenmozhi Soundararajan Equality Labs’s executive director told me. “In fact” she said “it is all castes against all castes.”)

More recently a September 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that first-generation Indian immigrants to the U.S. were significantly more likely than U.S.-born respondents to espouse a caste identity. The overwhelming majority of Hindus with a caste identity—more than eight in 10—self-identified as upper-caste and first-generation immigrants in particular tended to self-segregate making their communities more and more homogenous in terms of religion and caste. Respondents to the Carnegie survey had varying responses to experiencing different forms of discrimination depending on whether the discrimination occurred in the U.S. or in India and who suffered from it. Overall 73 percent viewed white supremacy as a threat to American democracy but only 53 percent saw Hindu majoritarianism as a threat to Indian democracy. On the question of affirmative action in university admissions the data suggest higher levels of support for the policy in the U.S. (54 percent) than India (47 percent).

The anguish caused by casteism is much like that caused by racism resulting not simply from hateful slurs but from an expansive and intimate system woven into behavior cultural practice and economics. On a granular level upper-caste Hindus do not share utensils or drinking water with those of lower castes and lighter skin tones are preferred to darker ones. On a systemic level society self-segregates with upper castes often congregating in the same neighborhoods; the achievements of upper-caste Hindus come at least partially at the expense of lower-caste communities.

The system dictates that every child inherits their family’s caste which is indicated by a person’s middle and last name—the name of one’s village and the profession of the family. Caste determines social status and spiritual purity and defines what jobs a person can do and whom they can marry. As outlined in Hindu mythology men were created unequal by Lord Brahma the Creator supreme among the triad of Hindu gods that also includes Lord Shiva the Destroyer and Lord Vishnu the Preserver. From Brahma’s head came the Brahmans—priests and intellectuals. From his arms came kings and warriors; from his thighs white-collar workers; and from his feet blue-collar workers. A fifth group once described as untouchables was kept outside of the caste system entirely its place in the social order to clean toilets sweep streets and dispose of dead bodies. (The word pariah comes from the Tamil language and refers to one of the most persecuted and lowest of caste groups the paṛaiyar in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Pariah is a global standard for social outcasts but Tamil-Brahman families including mine use it as a term of abuse and it has come to mean “someone who is despised.”)

The top three groups—Brahmans warriors and traders—are the upper castes and can intermarry and dine with one another. The last two groups the lower castes came to be seen as impure carrying with them a stigma surrounding their hygiene and apparent proclivity for infectious diseases (though these factors are tightly linked to residential segregation that means lower castes have poorer access to municipal services). Over time the term untouchable has been disavowed replaced in the late 19th century by Dalit which is Marathi for “broken but resilient people.”

India officially abolished the caste system soon after it won independence from Britain in 1947 but the system remains pervasive. Wealthy Indians in the country’s urban centers typically dismiss the caste system as either irrelevant in modern society or enforced only in poor rural India but neither is true. Though villages and small towns may be home to more overt forms of caste discrimination—literal lines for example denoting areas that Dalits cannot access—urban India is no caste-free oasis. And the Cisco and BAPS cases indicate that as Hindus emigrate foreign lands aren’t either.

While at Harvard I was asked by an Indian faculty member about my caste and family and (Indian) friends in the Bay Area asked me to explain what casteism is betraying a disappointing level of ignorance. When I gave my niece then 6 years old a children’s book on B. R. Ambedkar—one of India’s founding fathers a Dalit who led the writing of the country’s constitution—I was told by relatives that she was too young to be exposed to “such subjects.” My family and friends in the U.S. upper-caste Indians and Indian Americans in the Bay Area who work in the tech industry were unaware of the Cisco and BAPS cases and dismissed them when I described them. One responded in language that might be familiar to other minority groups who try to call out white privilege that “the Brahmans are the ones who are really suffering.”

The Cisco case marks a historic moment. The company—any company—would never have faced such charges in India where caste-based discrimination though illegal is an accepted reality. The case’s ramifications will be profound. For one they will shine a light on casteism itself and its ubiquity. Indeed even as a Dalit engineer allegedly suffered discrimination in California a Dalit professor resigned over what he said was caste discrimination at the Indian Institute of Technology’s Chennai campus.* For another the ruling will set a precedent for all American companies particularly those with large numbers of Indian employees or operations in India. They will potentially be forced to more deeply consider caste diversity and antidiscrimination training among their priorities along with race and gender.

The reality is that Indian immigrants in the U.S. and Indian Americans are an oppressed minority group as well as a community with immense power—both over other immigrant groups as a result of their wealth and over fellow Indians. It hurts me to see ignorance and xenophobia directed at members of my community in the U.S. but it maddens me when those same people blindly pay those forward to caste-oppressed minorities in India and elsewhere.

This need not remain the case. Already change—limited and hardly ambitious sure but change nonetheless—is under way. In September the California Democratic Party added caste as a protected category to its code of conduct. An association representing nearly half a million university students in the state has passed a resolution seeking a ban on caste-based discrimination. The Cisco and BAPS cases show that claimants can at least try to fight back via American courts.

Caste may have traveled from India and penetrated American workplaces colleges and communities like tea from a tea bag somehow allowing a millennia-old system of discrimination to remain intact in Massachusetts as much as it has in Maharashtra. Perhaps America can begin to reverse that and thereby set the tone for a progressive conversation about caste—both in the U.S. and in India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy9mYXN0LWZ1cmlvdXMtc3B5LXJhY2Vycy1yaXNlLW9mLXNoMWZ0M3ItcmVsZWFzZWQtdGhpcy13ZWVrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fast & Furious Spy Racers: Rise Of SH1FT3R Released This Week,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/games/fast-furious-spy-racers-rise-of-sh1ft3r-released-this-week/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy9mYXN0LWZ1cmlvdXMtc3B5LXJhY2Vycy1yaXNlLW9mLXNoMWZ0M3ItcmVsZWFzZWQtdGhpcy13ZWVrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The half-day of programming will educate women on the breadth of opportunity available in the field and within finance programs at Bryant.

The wide world of finance

There are enormous opportunities for women in the finance field says one of the forum’s lead organizers Mara Derderian M.B.A. Director of Financial Planning studies and Lecturer of Finance. The purpose of the event is to help introduce young women to the finance field she says.

“We have an amazing lineup of Bryant alumnae who are excited to come back and speak to our attendees.”

The program will provide an overview of the many career pathways that comprise the finance field and the skills needed for success while dispelling misconceptions all within a comfortable environment for exploring and asking questions. Attendees can experience first-hand Bryant’s close-knit friendly community which includes many alumnae finding success in the finance field – several of whom are panelists and speakers at the event.

“We have an amazing lineup of Bryant alumnae who are excited to come back and speak to our attendees. Their willingness and ability to share their knowledge is an indication of how confident they were entering the industry and how supportive they are of the next generation of young professionals interested in finance” says Derderian. “We’re very excited to host this event.”

“We have innovative programs of study in finance that expose students to exceptional programming earlier in their academic career. We incorporate the ability to get a range of licenses and certifications into our programs.”

Keynoting the event during a luncheon will be alumna Eileen Hayes ’07 a Vice President at Envestnet Inc who will deliver the final presentation of the day.

Earlier advising for greater impact

Since the term finance can be construed in a variety of ways says Derderian these sessions serve to define in more detail what a career in finance entails. For example by differentiating between financial planning and corporate finance the program can help attendees gain an understanding of these two very different career paths.

Attendees will also be able to gain an understanding of the kinds of finance and financial services programs of study offered at Bryant represented by the four tracks listed in the program: financial planning investment management banking and corporate finance.

“Understanding finance at an earlier age sets you up for success in many ways.”

The trio had a surprising explanation of what had happened to the money. Photos courtesy of the Vermont Historical Society

As much as we’d like to deny it Vermont has never been immune to corruption and fraud. It’s been here since the state’s founding by a group of land speculators including brothers Ira and Ethan Allen who were not averse to using their positions of power for personal gain.

And once the state was founded prominent Vermonters discovered new ways to abuse the public trust.

One of the most stunning and serpentine cases occurred in the early 1800s when three respected citizens who were directors of a branch of the Vermont State Bank were accused of gross mismanagement.

The trio faced a state inquiry which turned up all sorts of irregularities and illegalities. But perhaps most damning was the fact the bank was missing nearly $14000 a huge sum at the time. Only when investigators questioned them did the directors — prosperous lawyers Daniel Chipman and Horatio Seymour and physician John Willard — claim the bank had been robbed several years earlier of that amount and that the obvious suspect had not only left the state but also the country.

The story sounded far-fetched and all too convenient to investigators who sought to have the directors repay the missing money as well as funds they had mishandled.

But then Chipman used his power as speaker of the Vermont House to try to get the judgment overturned.

Banks were still novel in Vermont at the time. Vermonters had been divided over whether to form an official state bank in the early 1800s but had little choice. After the United States created a national bank in 1791 states started creating their own banks. Soon notes from out-of-state banks which acted as a kind of currency began circulating in Vermont.

These notes had advantages over the common barter system in which people swapped goods and labor. Barter transactions often required complex negotiations. How much time spent haying is a bushel of potatoes worth after all? Depends on how much you hate haying. Paying with notes which were paper surrogates for gold or silver held by the issuing banks was much simpler.

Paper money also had disadvantages principally that notes sometimes came from distant banks of unknown solvency. So once you had accepted payment in paper you had to find a way to get some value for it.

You could of course swap it with someone else for goods or services but the problem was finding a person willing to make the exchange. The issuing bank might go bankrupt before the holder could convert the paper into hard money so because of their riskiness notes usually traded at a discount. The farther notes were from the issuing bank the less they were worth.

Newspapers even printed tables showing the exchange rate for promissory notes issued by various banks.

Enter the state bank

In 1806 the Vermont Legislature created a state bank with branches in Burlington and Westminster. (The Westminster branch was soon replaced by one in Woodstock.) To ensure the banks remained solvent and the currency kept its value lawmakers required banks to raise capital in gold silver and copper coins worth $25000 before issuing any currency.

On the assumption that only a portion of the paper notes would be redeemed at any one time banks could issue notes worth a total of three times the value of the hard currency held in their vaults.

During the early 1800s the several branches of the Vermont State Bank each issued their own bills which were supposed to be backed by hard currency in the form of coins in the banks’ vaults. Photo by Mark Bushnell

The editor of Windsor’s Vermont Journal newspaper believed bank directors needed to have some skin in the game. Without a personal stake in the bank he wrote they “will lend bills as caprice and prejudice may dictate” and “lend to needy dependents and favorites.” The editor proved prescient as some branch directors quickly grew reckless.

But the state bank which added a branch in Middlebury had other pressing problems. The state economy was in shambles due to an American embargo against trade with Britain launched by President Jefferson in response to British military aggression. And directors of the various Vermont State Bank branches had quickly issued more paper currency than they could justify with the hard cash on hand.

So when people tried to redeem notes for coins the banks tried to discount the value of the currency being redeemed and delay transactions as long as possible. People understandably lost faith in the branches and their notes.

The Vermont House formed a committee to investigate. It found that the branches in Burlington Westminster and Woodstock all had made many bad loans and that their books contained significant irregularities. Still they all produced a profit.

The same couldn’t be said of Middlebury. Directors Chipman Seymour and Willard all had a stake in having a branch in their town — it bolstered the local economy — but they had no financial stake in it. When investigators examined the branch’s books they found them difficult to decipher but they were able to determine that the bank had given out numerous unsecured loans engaged in illegal banking practices and failed to collect thousands of dollars in interest on loans.

Furthermore investigators discovered that the directors decided not to use their considerable powers to collect debts. They could have seized property or had the debtors imprisoned. Instead they regularly sued the debtors with lawyers Chipman and Seymour racking up significant legal fees in the process. Worst of all the bank simply couldn’t account for a $13750 shortfall.

A political ploy

The House committee recommended that Chipman Seymour and Willard face lawsuits. Instead the directors suggested the Legislature could appoint a board to review the charges and make a ruling which the directors agreed to accept. A review board they argued would be cheaper more thorough and speedier than a bunch of lawsuits. Lawmakers agreed and appointed the justices of the Vermont Supreme Court to serve as the board.

When the review board asked about the missing money the directors offered an interesting explanation: Several years earlier they claimed a local merchant Joshua Henshaw had stolen it. Late one day in June 1809 the bank’s cashier had left the building for what he thought would be a brief errand so he bolted only one of two locks on the door.

However he didn’t return until the next morning and found both bolts locked. When a blacksmith let him into the bank the cashier found his key to the other lock on the counter where he had left it — suggesting that the cashier couldn’t have been the thief and that someone else had entered the building.

Historian Kenneth Degree who years ago wrote a detailed account of the Middlebury bank’s troubles in Vermont History the journal of the Vermont Historical Society poked numerous holes in the directors’ claims. The cashier said he failed to bolt both locks only this one time. How coincidental that this was the night Henshaw chose to strike!

Moreover Degree noted Henshaw was a convenient scapegoat. He had fled Middlebury just ahead of creditors and resettled in Montreal where he couldn’t easily be interviewed.

But if he had stolen the money Degree asked why hadn’t Henshaw simply repaid his debts? Even more curious: If the directors suspected Henshaw why was there a notation in the bank’s accounts that they had hired him the following year to install a safe?

The justices weren’t impressed with the directors’ defense finding that they owed the state nearly $23000. They were lucky not to face a criminal trial.

The case should have ended there as the directors had agreed but Chipman who represented Middlebury in the Legislature managed to get himself elected speaker of the House. In that office he received the justices’ report but decided that still another review was in order.

Not wanting to bias the committee of course Chipman asked another House member to appoint its members. In less than two weeks this latest committee composed of Chipman’s colleagues decided the directors were responsible for only $1200 lost due to the bank’s mismanagement.

The committee relied on new evidence to find the directors not responsible for the nearly $14000 that was missing. This new evidence relied on the word of 14-year old Udney Penniman who testified that Henshaw’s son had told him he had found a box in a cupboard in his home containing between $13000 and $14000.

Why would Penniman make up such a story? Perhaps Degree suggested because Penniman’s father Jabez was overdue repaying a loan from the Middlebury bank. So why would the House committee members believe the story? Could it be because it conveniently got their boss and two other prominent Vermonters off the hook?

The banking scandal failed to derail the careers of Chipman and Seymour. Chipman was soon elected to Congress and after his congressional career he returned to Vermont to help create the state Senate. (Up to that point Vermont’s legislative branch had only a single chamber.)

Seymour remained a wealthy lawyer and was eventually elected to the U.S. Senate.

Only Willard struggled after the scandal. He still owed nearly $3000 of a loan he had secured from the bank. Having already given up his medical practice he was unemployed with little way to earn back the money.

Consequently his wife Emma a former teacher had to return to work. She soon founded the Troy Female Seminary in New York State (now the Emma Willard School) and became a pioneer in girls’ education.

So at least one good thing came out of Vermont’s sordid banking affair.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdHJpb3RsZWRnZXIuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTEvMDcvYmVmb3JlLWFuZC1hZnRlci1waG90b3MtcXVpbmN5LXByb2plY3RzLXdvcmtzLzg0NjY1OTAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Before and after: Photos of Quincy projects in the works,"NEWS

Crypto hedge fund manager Rahul Rai believes the market will see ether overtake bitcoin in terms of market capitalization before the middle of next year in what experts call ""the flippening"".

The native token of the ethereum network hit record highs above $4600 this week after CME Group the world's largest derivatives exchange said it would launch micro ether futures in early December.

Ether's rise was propelled by a series of developments that underscored the growing momentum in the digital market beyond pure cryptocurrencies.

Facebook recently said it would rebrand itself as Meta in a nod to its commitment to expanding its activities in the metaverse while metaverse gaming platform Sandbox raised $3 million in a day. Even K-pop sensations BTS are set to launch digital photocards in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) thanks to a collaboration unveiled this week between their agency and South Korea's biggest cryptocurrency operator.

The ethereum network now has around $100 billion total value locked onto it according to The Block data. Yet ethereum is still very much second to bitcoin in terms of market value. This might not be the case for very much longer according to Rai the co-head of market neutral at BlockTower Capital.

""I definitely think there's a really good chance for ether to surpass bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised if it happened within the cycle"" the 24-year-old told Insider.

""Very tough to predict when this cycle will end. My take is mid-next year"" he continued.

Bitcoin is the number one crypto with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion while ether is in second place with a market cap of $535 billion — meaning it's edging closer to its rival.

Two years ago bitcoin accounted for almost 67% of the entire crypto market but its portion has dropped to 45%. Meanwhile ether's market share has risen from 8.5% to nearly 20%.

This year bitcoin has hit record highs near $70000 powered by major investors including the cryptocurrency in their portfolios as a means of diversifying their holdings and as a hedge against inflation.

""Bitcoin is a store of value it's digital gold. And so its market cap at most is going to be somewhere around gold — maybe larger because it has some properties that are better than gold. But that's roughly the benchmark you're going to use to cap its market size"" Rai said.

Gold's market cap is currently around $11 trillion according to CompaniesMarketCap data.

Rai who sold his crypto hedge fund Gamma Point Capital for $35 million this year said the versatility of the ethereum network would be the key attraction for developers and investors alike.

Ethereum is a layer one network that allows payments lending trading and staking. It enables peer-to-peer activity without a broker or bank as an intermediary. Unlike bitcoin's network the blockchain is programmable meaning it can run other applications such as smart contracts NFTs and even the metaverse.

""Ethereum is trying to power the rails of all of global finance in the future and that is a much bigger market if it does succeed"" Rai said.

""If it does succeed and if the thesis plays out then the market value is going to capture trillions of dollars in global activity and that's a much bigger market than (what) bitcoin's going up (toward)"" he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L3Nwb3J0L2dvbGYvMzAwNDQ4OTY2L29uc29uZy1seWRpYS1rby1zd2l0Y2hlcy1mb2N1cy10by1wcmVzdGlnaW91cy1scGdhLXRvdXItdHJvcGh50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On-song Lydia Ko switches focus to prestigious LPGA Tour trophy,,,,,,,

Components are hard to get there isn’t enough shipping capacity to move finished products and in some markets workers can’t get to building sites because of restrictions to contain the global pandemic.

Some of the world’s largest wind-turbine producers expect another tough year ahead.Surging commodity prices and supply-chain headwinds are set to last into next year according to Vestas Wind Systems A/S and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA. That’s making it harder for a business that’s so key to delivering the world’s climate goals to keep profitable.The challenges come at an awkward time. Just as world leaders are gathering in Glasgow  Scotland to try to hash out ambitious plans to avoid the worst consequences of global warming installing more renewable sources of energy is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive.“We are operating in a very difficult environment with challenging short-term market dynamics and low visibility on supply chain normalization” said Siemens Gamesa Chief Executive Officer Andreas Nauen. “However the current difficulties should not overshadow the bright future for wind energy driven by its role in the decarbonization of our planet.”“Everyone’s fighting against everyone to get both the raw materials and the components which leads to very adverse price stability” Vestas’s Chief Executive Officer Henrik Andersen said in an interview earlier this week.

Commodity prices surged this year as global economies rebounded from the pandemic boosting the price of everything from oil to natural gas and steel. The metal is the single biggest input for manufacturers making up about 84% of a turbine’s weight.

Vestas lowered its earnings outlook on Wednesday. It now expects full-year margin on earnings before interest and tax and before special items of 4%. That’s down from previous range of 5% to 7% and about half of what the company expected at the beginning of the year.On Friday Siemens Gamesa posted a second year of losses. The world’s largest maker of offshore wind turbines lost 627 million euros ($725 million) in the year ended in September. That’s on top of a loss of 918 million euros a year earlier. Still the company expects profits to recover next year with margins forecast to turn positive.Shares in both companies plunged this week adding to billions of dollars already shaved off their market value this year.“The market is expecting the situation will change and go back to normal but we truly don’t know when this will happen” Nauen said in a call with analysts on Friday.For Siemens Gamesa the impact has been particularly acute. Even before the current slate of problems the company had already been trying to turn its struggling business around. It appointed Nauen as chief executive last year as part of an overhaul meant to return its onshore turbine business to profitability.

This isn’t the first time the wind turbine business has faced difficulties. Companies have been locked in stiff competition as project developers fought to cut costs in order to win auctions to build wind farms.

“Margins have been squeezed pretty heavily for quite a few years now” said Oliver Metcalfe wind industry analyst at BloombergNEF. “These supply chain issues are making things worse.”If turbine makers can weather the current storm the future still looks bright. Demand for their products is set to surge in the coming years as the world increasingly relies on wind power to generate electricity. More renewables are also needed to reduce dependency on fossil fuels with prices of everything from coal to power and oil surging this year.“What is needed now is to ensure we have a high push on developing more renewable energy worldwide including Europe” Christian Rynning-Tonnesen chief executive officer of Norwegian electricity producer Statkraft AS said in an interview this week. “That’s needed for supply reasons but it’s also needed to fight climate change.

Teams must cut their 2024 rosters down to just 12 spots from as many as 18 training camp players. And while this year’s WNBA draft class is undoubtedly rife with talent only 18 draftees remain rostered ahead of Monday's final cuts. Last year just 15 of the league’s 36 draftees made it onto their team’s opening-day squad.

And it's not just rookies. Veteran players are also on the chopping block even former title-winners: On Thursday the Minnesota Lynx waived 2021 WNBA champ Ruthy Hebard.

But with every wave of cuts players that survive dismissal inch closer to claiming a coveted roster spot. The Las Vegas Aces have already reached that magic number 12 opening the door for draft picks Dyaisha Fair and Kate Martin to stay on with the reigning champs.

Additionally Dallas has whittled their training camp group down to 12. Fifth overall pick Jacy Sheldon and undrafted rookie Jaelyn Brown continue to remain in the mix.

Other teams meanwhile still have decisions to make. Seattle currently lists 13 players while others like New York still have a full 18 players in training camp. It’s likely that the final preseason game will tip roster decisions one way or another as coaching staffs continue to evaluate performance and playing time.

But being cut doesn't mean the end of the road for everyone. Should players be waived they can still be signed to short-term hardship contracts with teams carrying injured players on their permanent rosters.

The bill passed in the House on Friday night after months spent negotiating amid an internal rift among moderate and progressive Democrats. In its statement Comcast heralded the bill as a major benefit to the United States’ economic future.

“Congress and the Biden Administration should be applauded for passage of the momentous infrastructure bill. This legislation will bring meaningful investments and jobs across the country and marks a major bipartisan effort to tackle digital equity and access in America recognizing that broadband is a critical part of 21st century infrastructure” said Sena Fitzmaurice senior vice president of government communications at Comcast Corporation.

“The provisions in the final act appropriately focus on getting broadband infrastructure first to areas where it does not currently exist while at the same time continuing to promote faster speeds and disincentivizing duplicative projects” Fitzmaurice’s statement continues. “The bill also provides important resources to spur broadband adoption. Allowing local communities flexibility and valuing both private and publicly funded projects will be key to closing the digital divide.”

Popular on Variety

The infrastructure bill which passed in the Senate in August is a $1.2 trillion legislation which will deliver $550 billion of new federal investments in America’s infrastructure over five years as well as invest $65 billion in improving the nation’s broadband infrastructure. This broadband access aims to improve internet services for rural areas low-income families and tribal communities bridging what Comcast calls a “digital divide.” Most of the money for broadband access will be made available to states through grants.

Along with the construction of infrastructure the infrastructure bill provides a benefit to companies that have invested heavily in streaming content as more Americans will gain access to their online platforms in the coming years.

The final vote on the bill was 228-206. Thirteen Republicans voted with the majority of Democrats while six Democrats voted against including progressive Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massuchesetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYWZyby5jb20vdGlmZmFueS1oYXJ2ZXktYXBwb2ludGVkLXRvLWNvbWNhc3QtZ292ZXJubWVudC1hbmQtcmVndWxhdG9yeS1hZmZhaXJzLWZvci1tYXJ5bGFuZC1hbmQtZGVsYXdhcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tiffany Harvey appointed to Comcast Government and Regulatory Affairs for Maryland and Delaware,"ANNAPOLIS MD – November 5 2021 – Comcast has announced the appointment of Tiffany Harvey as Vice President Government & Regulatory Affairs.

Top-ranked Batavia fell to Mount Carmel after junior Dennis Furlong's nine-yard touchdown run on an untimed down after time expired on Friday night.

Players and fans from Mount Carmel celebrate their Round 2 playoff victory over top-seeded Batavia on Friday November 5 2021. | Comcast SportsNet

In the second round of the Class 7A playoffs under the Friday night lights top-ranked Batavia fell to Mount Carmel after junior Dennis Furlong's nine-yard touchdown run on an untimed down after time expired on Friday.

The first half was a relatively normal affair with the undefeated #1-seed Batavia Bulldogs (10-1) and the #17-seed Mount Carmel Caravan (8-3) battling to continue their respective runs for the state title.

Batavia's star senior running back Jalen Buckley (15 carries for 43 yards 1 TD) opened scoring on the opening possession of the game to give the Bulldogs a quick start and a 7-0 lead but the Caravan countered with Mount Carmel quarterback Blainey Dowling's 21-yard TD pass to sophomore Darrion Gilliam.

Bulldogs sophomore quarterback Ryan Boe (7 for 14 for 115 yards 1 TD) hit AJ Sanders with a 37-yard touchdown pass to go up 14-7 and Mount Carmel's field goal sent the teams into halftime with a score of 14-10.

In the second half both defenses dug in and scoring stopped.

Mount Carmel junior defensive lineman Danny Novickas who finished with two sacks told the Daily Herald's Jake Bartelson ""Just making sure they don't make it passed us in the secondary. We all play as one. One person messes up it's everybody's fault...""

The questions for Batavia began when the penalty flags started piling up particularly when they were hit with three holding calls on big runs.

Batavia was flagged 12 times for 117 yards in penalties while Mount Carmel was flagged 5 times for 25 yards.

Batavia Coach Dennis Piron told Michael J. O'Brien of the Chicago Sun-Times:

""Any play that we had in the second half that was substantial on runs we got called holding calls"" Piron said. ""I don't know what the [penalty] numbers were; they were bad. They were bad ... I just felt like we were playing against two teams. I think that's what I'll use. It [was] like we were playing against two teams ... I never seen that in my life.""

But the real confusion for Coach Piron and the Bulldogs came in the game's final moments.

On 4th-and-13 with under two minutes left and the ball at midfield Mount Carmel quarterback Blainey Dowling chucked a pass that landed nowhere near his Caravan receiver. The Batavia sideline thought they were about to close out the win but the referees threw another flag and called Batavia for defensive pass interference to keep Mt. Carmel's drive alive.

Mount Carmel continued to drive until 0:04 seconds remained with the ball on the Batavia 7-yard line.

Time expired on an incomplete pass into the end zone where both the Batavia defender and Mount Carmel receiver fell to the ground.

Another defensive pass interference flag. If the flag had been against Mount Carmel or there was no flag the game would have been over.

The ball was moved to the Batavia 3-yard line and with no time on the clock Mount Carmel was given one more play to win.

After a timeout Mount Carmel was hit with a delay of game penalty and backed up to the Batavia 8-yard line. Still with no time on the clock they were given another play.

Dowling took the snap and handed the ball off to Caravan junior Dennis Furlong. Furlong swept around the right side and made a great move to cause a Batavia tackler to miss and get himself into the endzone where he was mobbed by teammates sending Mount Carmel into Round 3 of the IHSA Class 7A playoffs with the 16-14 victory.

Emotions were high and the two teams didn't shake hands.

The Caravan's junior quarterback Blainey Dowling (7 for 13 for 96 yards 1 TD) told Michael J. O'Brien of the Chicago Sun-Times after the game the win was all his defense “They are the reason we won this game. Awesome job by them.”

Batavia coach Dennis Piron had a lot to say to reporters.

""[The refs] didn't tell me anything the whole game"" Piron told reporters. ""I didn't get a single clarification on a call hardly ever the entire game. It was very confusing. It was very confusing. They were confused on calls. I asked them for clarification and they were just like 'move the ball.' I felt like it was in a practice or something. I don't know. It was very confusing. The entire game. Beginning until end.""

""I’m not a person that says things like this"" Coach Piron continued. ""I can’t make these kids feel better. It isn’t the loss. I don’t mind losing games. This is going to sound horrible in the paper tomorrow but whatever.”

Coach Piron also spoke with the Daily Herald's Jake Bartelson to clarify the lack of handshakes:

OK. I did a follow-up call with Coach Piron. On the no-handshakes: “I did shake Lynch’s hand at midfield. It wasn’t a sportsmanship issue. It was a safety issue at that point at time. Things never got to a level of calmness [at the game’s end] for either team [for it to happen].” — Jake Bartelson (@JakeBartelson) November 6 2021

This game is scheduled to be replayed on Comcast SportsNet at noon and 4 p.m. on Saturday.

Mount Carmel advances to play the winner of Saturday's Brother Rice-Yorkville game in Round 3.

On October 14 Canopy Growth announced their plans to acquire Wana Brands the number one cannabis edibles brand based on market share in North America. The two companies entered into an agreement that gives Canopy the right to acquire 100% of the membership interests of Wana Brands (a call option to acquire 100% of each Wana entity) once a “triggering event” such as when plant-touching companies begin trading on major US stock exchanges or full federal legalization occurs.

As part of the agreement Canopy Growth makes an upfront payment of $297.5 million to Wana Brands. Until the United States moves on cannabis legalization or companies can start trading on U.S. exchanges and Canopy uses the call option to acquire Wana Brands they don’t get any voting or economic interest in Wana Brands. The two companies are essentially operating completely independently of each other until the US legalizes cannabis.

Nancy Whiteman co-founded Wana Brands in 2010 and since then the company has expanded significantly. Following the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Colorado their sales skyrocketed. Over the next few years Whiteman oversaw the company’s expansion into a number of new states. In 2016 they moved into Oregon’s market and quickly grew their brand presence seemingly overnight. Then they expanded into Nevada Arizona and Illinois in 2017. After that the company made a major East Coast push expanding into Maryland Florida and Massachusetts with other major northeast markets expected to be added soon. The brand now has products available in twelve US states and nine Canadian provinces with plans to add four additional states by the end of the year.

Shortly after the announcement we sat down together over coffee in Las Vegas to discuss Whiteman’s journey to success her plans for the company’s expansion and what the future might hold for Wana Brands.

Aaron G. Biros: First of all congratulations on the acquisition. As a co-founder and CEO it must be amazing to see the success of your company and all you’ve accomplished. How do you feel?

Nancy Whiteman: I feel ecstatic. I am so excited and so proud of what Wana has accomplished. Just all around a great feeling.

Biros: What was it like leading up to this moment? From the inception of the business did you ever have any doubts you’d make it this far?

Whiteman: A thousand times. Absolutely. Anyone in cannabis that tells you they didn’t have any doubts is probably not being very honest. I had been thinking about partnership for a while. I felt the timing was right because of a variety of reasons but also the possibility of federal legalization. I wanted to make sure that Wana was really going to be well positioned for future growth. One of the things that I said in our employee meeting – I quoted the old proverb of ‘If you want to go fast go alone but if you want to go far go together.’ We’ve been going it alone for eleven years and we’ve gone very fast. But I want Wana to continue to be a major player in the industry and to go far. I really felt that this was the time in the industry to strike a partnership.

So that’s a little bit of the thinking behind it. I think when there is federal legalization there is going to be a host of competitors entering the industry that are going to be unlike anything we’ve faced before. I think it’s going to be challenging for independent brands to scale as rapidly as they’re going to need to scale to compete against all of this new competition on their own. So that’s the why behind the timing of it.

In terms of why Canopy I’ve known Canopy for quite a while. I met them when we were looking for partners about three and a half years ago. We did not end up putting together a deal at that point in time but I did get to know the company quite a bit. Since then that company has changed significantly with leadership changes and became a very different company with the Constellation Brands investment behind them.

When I think about the future of the industry and particularly post-legalization I have certain things that I am looking for in partners. Of course I am looking for financial strength in a partner. I was really looking for a company that has a very long-term perspective on the industry with both the proper resources and the proper mindset to make long-term investments for the future. And then my belief is that post-legalization we’re going to see radical changes in the industry including where products are cultivated in a global market more distribution outside of dispensaries – and I think liquor stores could be a likely form of distribution at some point in time so the relationship with Constellation was very interesting and appealing to me. But all of those things wouldn’t mean as much to me if I didn’t feel we didn’t have a good fit in terms of our shared values and how we saw the industry. We spent a lot of time talking about that and I think one of the aspects that really attracted me to Canopy was that we are very aligned on how we see the future of the industry shaping up. Certainly I think there is a wonderfully viable position for cannabis as an alcohol replacement however we also have a lot of focus on innovation and the health and wellness aspects of cannabis. I was really looking for a partner that felt the same and it ended up that we really were aligned on those values.

Biros: What does it look like going forward? Since you’re staying on board how will your new role change?

Whiteman: My new role doesn’t change at all actually. I woke up last Monday—the week after the big announcement–and it felt very normal getting back to work and having my usual meetings. This was my fifteen minutes of fame and thankfully its diminishing so now it’s just back to work as usual.

But moving forward we have big plans. Wana is launching in four new markets over the next couple of months we’re in discussions to launch in an additional six markets and we have very robust innovation pipeline. So we’re just really busy right now just executing on our strategy. I am looking forward to getting to know our new colleagues at Canopy better and exploring different collaboration possibilities.

I feel very optimistic. I was thrilled our employees were delighted with the news and morale is very high. The feedback from the rest of the industry has been really positive and overall I am feeling very good about this decision.

Biros: So you mentioned some expansion plans for four new markets in the next few months. How does the acquisition help Wana Brands expand?

Whiteman: You know we haven’t announced the new states so I can’t speak to those publicly yet. They were all in the works before this deal and are currently in the process of being onboarded. Where it will get interesting is how this deal impacts new states that we move into. Until Canopy decides to exercise the call option [to acquire 100% of membership interests in each Wana entity] we are still an independently owned and run company. So we are still going to be looking for the best partners that we can find in new markets and the Canopy connection will certainly be helpful to us. But to your point about the plans we’ll be announcing those new market expansions in the coming weeks.

Biros: As a woman leader with an extremely significant position in the cannabis industry do you have any advice for young aspiring entrepreneurs women leaders or other women in the cannabis space?

Whiteman: I do. I posted something on LinkedIn the other day and I’m going to make the same comment to you as I made in that post because I think it’s important and particularly important for young women. People have said a lot of nice things about me in the past couple of weeks and of course everybody loves to hear nice things about themselves. But the truth is some of them are not true. And one of them that is definitely not true is that I am somehow fearless. And I guess what I would say to women and young entrepreneurs is that fearlessness is a myth.

Being an entrepreneur is hard. You’re putting your money on the line you’re putting your time on the line you’re putting your reputation you’re potentially putting your family’s your friends’ and your investors’ money on the line. Who would not be afraid against that backdrop? We all have times of feeling fearful of feeling anxious of having sleepless nights. So what I would say is don’t aspire to be fearless. There are other aspirations that are much more useful. For example aspire to be resilient aspire to be persistent aspire to be of service to other people aspire to be very true to your values and your strategy. Don’t let this mythology of what a “leader” is supposed to look like make you feel bad about your emotions. It’s not about having those emotions it’s what you do with them.

That’s what I would say to young entrepreneurs and especially to women. Because I do believe that women hold themselves to a very high standard a lot of the time and have a lot of misconceptions of what they’re supposed to be living up to when it comes to leadership.

Biros: What an incredible perspective to have. Okay one last question for you: what are you doing to celebrate?

Whiteman: So far I’ve been too busy to celebrate! This just happened so recently. I would like to take a great trip with my kids. I don’t really know I have not had time to figure that out. People tell me I need to go to Disney. But right now it’s still taking a little while to let it all sink in.

Biros: Wonderful! And Nancy thank you so much for your time I really appreciate it.

Whiteman: And thank you! So nice to see you in person.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLXJldmlld3MtdGFzdGluZ3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1tZXJsb3QtZGF5LTEwLXdpbmVzLXRvLXRyeS00NjgyNDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International Merlot Day: 10 wines to try,"Loved by many but perhaps underestimated by most Merlot is often considered a lesser blending companion to other varieties especially its Bordeaux half-sibling Cabernet Sauvignon. (DNA profiling has shown Merlot is most likely the progeny of Magdeleine Noire des Charentes and Cabernet Franc the latter also a parent of Cabernet Sauvignon).

Merlot increased its popularity and acreage during the 1980s becoming ubiquitous in supermarket shelves the world over. Backlash followed with the variety suffering for a long time and perhaps still from a poor reputation mostly associated with flabby overripe sickly soft wines. This perception was only amplified by the ‘Sideways phenomenon’ as a result of the derogatory portrait of the variety in the 2004 film. Such reputation is highly undeserved as Merlot can produce elegant and subtly structured wines with great ageing potential if handled correctly and not harvested too late.

Merlot has travelled well beyond its spiritual home Right bank Bordeaux with lovely expressions hailing from all over the world especially Tuscany California and Chilewhich have become sources of single-varietal wines of great character and elegance – but also of some of the mass-produced examples that damaged Merlot’s reputation. Merlot can deliver wines that balance softness with ripe yet vibrant fruit underscored by a delicious mocha or chocolate-like touch.

Merlot’s softness fruit-forwardness and measured acidity lend themselves to easy-drinking styles perfect for uncomplicated everyday pours that will pair well with a midweek dinner be it a spaghetti carbonara a Caesar salad or a club sandwich.

Retailers are also experimenting with alternative formats such as bag-in-box particularly suited for best-value everyday wines and which are budget environmentally and sharing-friendly.

The list below highlights how Merlot can truly live up to its status as a leading ‘international variety’ capable of producing wines that are approachable without being boring. Some might become your go-to everyday wines others are a good option for a special bottle to keep in the cellar for a celebratory occasion.

Copart the source for all your crunched-up car needs has delivered yet again with a BMW M4 Competition so fresh it’s probably still got a hint of new car smell lingering. Sadly it has also been involved in a pretty severe accident.

With both wheels on the left-hand side of the vehicle apparently torn off and the airbags deployed the car has had an eventful early life. According to the Carfax report which may or may not be right about the mileage the M4 Competition has 1780 miles (about 2865km) on the odometer with the dealer registering the car on September 19. We found the ad on Copart at the end of October so the owner had it in their possession for about a month give or take before the accident.

Who knows if the driver took lessons from a Mustang owner or if it was their fault at all but photos of the car from the right look almost pristine while the left side of the M4 makes it look like the car may have slid into a curb going sideways. Still it’s unclear what kind of activity could have led to such an accident.

Copart‘s information suggests that both the wheels and the undercarriage were damaged in the incident. Apart from that though the car looks in a pretty good shape that it’s quite tempting even if that’s only for its parts.

The engine is a 3.0-liter inline-six with twin turbos that delivers 503 hp (510 PS / 375 kW) and 479 lb-ft (650 Nm) of torque which are funneled to the road via an eight-speed automatic transmission. This car is not an xDrive AWD model which means that it’s rear-wheel drive and hits 62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.9 seconds instead of the 3.5 seconds of the AWD version.

The M4 Competition Coupe starts at $74700 in the U.S. and Copart estimates that this car with all of its options amounted to $108641. Being sold in Miami Florida there is no auction date yet but if you do end up buying it do get in touch and we might feature your story.

Correction: A previous version of this article wrongly listed the mileage from the dashboard as 124mi which was apparently the remaining range. After a check on CarFax the car appears to have been driven 1781 miles before the crash having been registered by the dealer on Sep 19 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Horseheads claimed the Class A title Maine-Endwell was tops in Class B and Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour dominated in Class C for its fifth consecutive sectional championship. Watkins Glen won the previous four championships as a solo program.

The titles were the second in a row for Horseheads and M-E.

Classes A and C were held at Watkins Glen and Class B was held at Maine-Endwell.

McKane was named Class A Swimming & Diving Outstanding Performer after winning two individual events and two relays. Her time of 55.36 in the butterfly moved to the top of the state chart and also is fast enough for All-American consideration.

She added a win in the 50 freestyle in 24.17 also below the state cut. Corning's 400 freestyle relay of McKane Carolyn Heckle Kara Peters and Vanessa Turner won in a state-qualifying 3:41.62. McKane was also part of a win in the 200 freestyle relay.

Binghamton's Ava Olsian topped the state standard in the 100 freestyle with her winning effort of 54.32 and also won the 100 breaststroke. Her leadoff time of 24.75 in the 200 freestyle relay was below the state cut for the 50 freestyle.

Ithaca's Ilah Jefferis was below the state cut in the butterfly with her second-place time of 59.63.

Maine-Endwell's Maria Pignatelli was a standout in Class B. Her wins in the 100 butterfly (53.09) and 200 IM (2:10.97) were below the state cut. She also helped the Spartans to first place in the 200 freestyle relay.

Chenango Valley's Lindsey Rice won the 100 breaststroke with a state-qualifying time of 1:06.99 and helped CV to wins in the 200 medley relay and 400 freestyle relay.

Diving was held Friday and two of the three champions topped the state standard of 440 Horseheads' Emma Bachert in Class A (443.10) and Owego's Kaelyn Katchuk in Class B (451.55).

Up next

Swimmers and divers who reached the state standard at any point in the season qualified for the New York state championship meet to be held Nov. 19 and 20 at Ithaca College. For any events without a state-qualifying time the swimmer with the top time from sectionals advances.

Horseheads rallied in each of the first two sets to win by scores of 30-28 and 25-23 then persevered to clinch the title with a 25-23 triumph in the first of four sectional finals at Corning-Painted Post High School. Vestal swept Union-Endicott 3-0 on Wednesday to win the Class A sectional crown.

""It could have went either way"" Horseheads coach Tim Crout said. ""We could have lost all three sets but that never-say-die attitude and that willingness to want to meet that goal they set is what carried us through.

""I’m just so proud to be the coach of these young ladies. I’m tickled to death. This is one of their goals so we were able to check it off. I’m so proud of Ithaca. They have some amazing kids on their team some very friendly personable kids. Like I told them after the match 'You will be AA Section 4 champions next year.' They have a lot of juniors coming back. Horseheads is dropping down to an A next year as of right now because of the student population.""

The Blue Raiders improved to 14-0 in dual matches and added the sectional title to the Southern Tier Athletic Conference tournament championship they captured last week.

Third-seeded Ithaca (7-6) beat second-seeded Corning in four sets in Thursday's semifinal. Top-seeded Horseheads had a bye into the final.

""It went exactly like I thought"" Crout said of the tight contest. ""I was up at 5:30 this morning watching more film. Me and three of the girls went up and watched the Corning game the other night and Ithaca has got an amazing team. Out of all the teams we see in the season they’ve definitely improved the most.""

Madison Adams paced the Blue Raiders with 14 kills. Taylor Malone added 13 kills 13 digs and four aces. Lydia Schooley contributed 19 setter assists and Nia Lewis had 13.

Malone's string of service points helped Horseheads overcome a 19-9 deficit in the second set.

""That team played amazing to keep Taylor on the line"" Crout said. ""For her to serve that many straight points that was the key. Every time we have played Ithaca we have had battles with them. The key to beating Ithaca this year has been service runs.""

Ithaca led the opening set by scores of 26-25 and 27-26 but Crout credited his players with battling hard to rally for the win.

""To watch the points rack up and just go 22-23 and then know you’re going to have to be pushing out more and go to 24-24 and things like that it definitely is super tense"" Adams said. ""But knowing you’re going through the same thing as the rest of your team and you want it just as much as the rest of your team it really gives you that confidence to know that no matter what you’re doing this with your team and you have them there and you’re able to put that trust in them.""

Crout felt his team had the talent to win a sectional title during the 2020-21 school year but there was no opportunity for either STAC or Section 4 championships because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Having this be my senior year having it be after a pretty unusual season last year and not really having the opportunities that we had this year I think it made it all that more special just to keep winning and to have such a great team to be winning with"" Adams said. ""I think this couldn’t have been a better season for me and I’m so excited to keep going.""

Horseheads will play Section 1 champion North Rockland in a regional semifinal at 10 a.m. Thursday at Arlington High School in Dutchess County. Because it's a nearly four-hour trip the Raiders will head down after a short practice Wednesday. Thursday's winner plays the Section 9 champion at 10 a.m. Nov. 13 at Millbrook High School.

""I do think this is a great opportunity for the younger girls as well as us seniors to really just show our skill level and to show just how hungry we are for that state championship title"" Adams said.

The subtitle of this video reads “How much Plastic this time?” and this appears like a little teasing. In the Google Pixel 5 the company had to open a large hole in its metal rear so as to accommodate the wireless charging coil. Of course Google covered the hole with a piece of resin. JerryRigEverything first checks the smartphone’s display against the Mohs hardness rating. The results show that Corning Gorilla Victus glass used on the screen appears at a Mohs hardness level of 6. This smartphone is susceptible to slight scratches.

Subsequently the lens module protruding from the back of the mobile phone was tested. The hardness test was carried out on the rear camera lens module with a cutter. The test results showed that the flat part of the lens rear cover is made of glass. However the bending area between the bodies is made of plastic.

After that he tests the side frame bottom frame phone buttons and SIM card tray of the Pixel 6 Pro. The above parts use an aluminum material. However because an antenna (presumably a millimeter-wave antenna) is at the top frame the top frame of the phone uses a plastic material. JerryRigEverything also conducted a burn test on the Pixel 6 Pro screen. After the burn test the Google Pixel 6 Pro gets some scratches on the screen fingerprint reader region.

JerryRigEverything initially speculates that because the Pixel 6 Pro adopts a double-layer glass design it may break directly during the free-hand bending. However after the bending test the Google Pixel 6 Pro retains its structural integrity.

While it’s been nine years since One Tree Hill aired its final episode on the CW the show’s stars have remained pals even reuniting from time to time.

Jana Kramer joined forces with several of her former OTH costars including Stephen Colletti Kate Voegele Austin Nichols and Shantel VanSanten at the “A Weekend in Tree Hill 3” fundraiser in Wilmington North Carolina on Friday November 5.

“And the saga continues 😂😂” the “I Got the Boy” songstress 37 captioned an Instagram snap with the Laguna Beach alum 35 and Voegele 34. “Who do you think chase should have picked ?”

In the snap the two ladies — who both sang at the benefit concert per social media footage — jokingly played tug-of-war with Colletti.

Kramer’s playful cast reunion with the California native came on the heels of her previous drama with Kristin Cavallari who famously was involved in a dramatic love triangle with the Everyone Is Doing Great actor on their MTV reality show. Cavallari for her part later wed Jay Cutler in 2013 before calling it quits in April 2020.

Following his split from the Very Cavallari alum 34 the former NFL athlete 38 notably went on a few dates with the Michigan native.

“Kristin wasn’t jealous to begin with” a source previously told Us Weekly in October 2021 after photos of Cutler and Kramer were shared online noting that the retired football player was the one to break it off with the Soccer Mom Madam star.

“The real reason [they broke up] is because he didn’t succeed at making Kristin jealous” the source added at the time. “He took Jana to the most public places for their dates knowing they would be photographed together and would get attention from being out in Nashville but it never worked.”

The “Voices” singer for her part split from ex-husband Mike Caussin — with whom she shares daughter Jolie 5 and son Jace 2 — earlier this year. The exes who briefly uncoupled in 2016 amid cheating allegations on the 34-year-old former athlete’s part finalized their divorce in July after previously reconciling. Following the breakup Kramer was briefly linked with the “Uncut” podcast host in September after they were spotted together in Nashville.

At the time eagle-eyed fans thought one of the Hills alum’s September Instagram snaps seemingly shaded Kramer’s budding friendship with Cutler. Cavallari shared a poolside selfie with the speculative caption “Sorry I haven’t responded to you” which was posted days after Us reported that the cookbook author wasn’t enthused to hear about the budding romance between her one-time friend and former partner.

Following the alleged drama between the Uncommon James founder and the Hallmark movie actress Kramer exclusively told Us in September that she had “respect for everyone.”

Elsewhere during the Friday night event Kramer shared additional photos via Instagram and Instagram Story with her other former CW costars.

“Plot twist. ‘Brooke got the boy….Alex got the man’ she captioned a prom-pose style photo shoot with the Holiday in the Sun actor 41. “Julian and Alex are now together years later 🤣. What do the cool kids say? Do y’all ship this?”

The longtime group of friends even took whiskey shots ahead of the musical performances in which both Nichols and VanSanten 36 surprised the Christmas in Mississippi actress.

Though the chain has reintroduced some items like relish at the condiment station and the churros it's hard to ignore the beloved items that have yet to return to the food court menu.

While those options may seem endless the menu modifications are ever-changing. Some items may have unfortunately seen their last days. Keep reading to see what items won't be spared right now.

Combo Pizza

This Costco crowd-pleaser may have come to the end of its road. The combo pizza—topped with pepperoni sausage and veggies—was either served by the slice or the whole pie pre-pandemic. Those who weren't quite ready to say goodbye to the pizza didn't hesitate to voice their concerns about the change. Its' disappearance sparked a massive outcry that even led to several online petitions to resurrect the beloved menu item. One Reddit user even claimed to offer feedback to Costco and noticed that the decision was a national one.

Like many @stgraff brought the issue to Costco's attention to no avail but the company noted that this removal was not an easy one. ""A difficult decision was made to simplify our business and unfortunately the Combo Pizza was removed from our menu line up"" was the chain's response when addressing the change.

Straws

Shoppers have noticed quite the difference when grabbing drinks from the Costco food court. Some warehouses have decided to forsake paper straws in favor of plastic lids. These come with a tab that when pressed creates an opening to sip through the top.

The disappearance of straws has been met with mixed reviews though.

""Oh i hate these new caps"" one user commented on Reddit. In response to the comment @jmlinden7 noted that the lids are ""Still better than paper straws"". Another user even described the paper straws ""… like nails on a chalkboard.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Turkey and Provolone Sandwich

It's felt like ages since we've last seen the turkey and provolone sandwich on Costco's food court menu. The pandemic caused many items on this list to disappear including the sandwich. Unfortunately for many members they haven't seen it since.

""I live off the turkey provolone. Much sadness"" one Reddit user said in a thread discussing the removal of food court items.

They weren't alone however; yet another Redditor voiced their opposition to the change saying combined with another is truly heartbreaking: ""Not the hot turkey provolone sandwich and combo pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

Phone Orders

Not everyone is able to place orders over the phone like they used to. Costco members have claimed that some food courts no longer take orders over the phone. For those who wish to do so you may have to visit the store in person to have your order filled.

One Redditor recently wrote that ultimately ordering on the phone may be more trouble than it's worth.

""Calling ahead for pizza is slower than just ordering it at the kiosk….I honestly have no idea what the benefit of calling ahead is — it seems to be a detriment rather than a time saver"" wrote @wiltony.

Food Court Chili

The Costco food court chili was once available for $3.99. It contained beef kidney and pinto beans bell peppers and onion and was available in food courts from coast to coast but is no longer being seen on the menu.

Several commenters took to Reddit to discuss the reason for the chili's disappearance.

""…I wanted to know what happened to it? Did it not sell enough or did the majority hate it that much?"" asked the thread's original poster. While other commenters couldn't figure out the exact reason why chili was taken off the menu some noted that they liked pairing it with other food court items like a hotdog as a topping.

Crown Princess Mary of Denmark led the Danish royals as they greeted huntsmen taking part in an annual event at their 18th century lodge.

The mother-of-four 49 was joined by her 10-year-old twins Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent on the balcony of Hermitage Castle in a woodland north of Copenhagen for the Hubertus Hunt.

The Danish royals were there to greet tens of thousands of people who had turned out to watch the iconic 13 kilometre cross-country horse race which marks the end of the hunting season in Denmark.

The trio were pictured waving at spectators as they rode past in a horse-drawn carriage ahead of the race before taking to the balcony to watch the race.

Princess Mary was seen embracing Prince Vincent on the balcony as Princess Josephine smiled and waved to the crowds.

The Hubertus Hunt is an annual cross-country horse race held on the first Sunday of November in Deer Park in Klampenborg north of Copenhagen.

Dating back to the 1900s the event marks the end of the Danish hunting season with 160 hunters on horseback riding over hedges and water features across the park.

It was once a real hunt but now the traditional fox and stag have been replaced by a set course for the riders in red jackets and their horses - with two leading riders wearing a fox tail on their shoulders.

The mother - who shares Prince Christian Princess Isabella and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine with husband Crown Prince Frederik - wore a tailored black coat coupled with a grey hat.

In order for the riders to qualify for the Hubertus Hunt the riders must have completed eight of this year's hunts in order to make sure they are able to jump the high obstacles.

May Britt Kattrup the winner of the Hubertus Hunt in 1992 told Danish Radio: 'The horses are often turned on in the surroundings with many horses and the large audience therefore it is important to be able to control his horse but it is the rider's own responsibility to be qualified for the task.'

The Danish royal family have sparked controversy in the past over their traditional annual hunts.

In 2019 they were pictured in front of a lawn-full of slain deer on the eve of their annual hunt.

Prince Frederik of Denmark hosted the 'King's Hunt' leading an entourage of prominent guests and other members of the royal family through the Gludsted Plantation in central Jutland.

After the hunt the prince his wife Princess Mary Queen Margrethe and their guests stood outside the Fredensborg Palace for a traditional hunting parade.

Perhaps more surprisingly it attracted enough support from Republicans to pass the Senate in August. Though as of this writing Democrats in the House are divided over how and whether to tie the bill to other agendas it seems likely that Biden will eventually realize his ambition to tilt far more transportation dollars toward rail.

It’s a worthy goal. The bill promises to furnish a more convenient and environmentally friendly mode of travel between destinations that are far enough apart to make driving tedious but close enough together to make flying impossible or at best impractical. You might never use these new trains yourself but those who do will benefit you by creating less traffic congestion cleaner air and a cooler planet. Removing more freight from pavement-pounding long-haul semitrucks onto super-fuel-efficient trains will make driving safer and more pleasant and would yield huge reductions in carbon emissions.

But for any of this to happen on any meaningful scale the Biden administration will need to do more than just invest more public money in train travel. It will also need to reverse decades of deregulation lax antitrust enforcement and other policy blunders that have left modern-day robber barons in control of nearly all the nation’s highly monopolized railroad infrastructure just as they were in the worst days of the Gilded Age. Only this time the financiers aren’t presiding over an expanding rail system; they’re selling it off and permanently liquidating its assets for short-term economic gain.

Unless Biden takes on the financiers even maintaining Amtrak service let alone expanding it will become ridiculously expensive. Here’s an example that shows why.

Amtrak for decades offered train service along the Gulf Coast corridor between New Orleans and Mobile Alabama. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina badly damaged the tracks. The two giant corporate rail systems that own the line Norfolk Southern and CSX made the necessary repairs and within a year resumed running their own freight trains. But Amtrak service has never returned.

It is not that people in the region don’t want their Amtrak trains back. A broad coalition of civic and business leaders including Mississippi Republican Senator Roger Wicker has been trying for years to persuade the railroads to let Amtrak resume operating. They point to a study by the Trent Lott National Center at the University of Southern Mississippi that says restoring Amtrak service will boost tourism significantly greatly benefiting Mississippi’s beaches and casinos. They point to the report of a special Gulf Coast Working Group created by Congress that estimates the cost of resuming Gulf Coast passenger service at $5.4 million. They point to the fact that the Biden administration Amtrak and the state governments of Louisiana and Mississippi are all committed to furnishing the necessary operating funds.

But after five years of negotiations you still can’t take the train to Gulfport Biloxi Pascagoula or anywhere else along the Gulf Coast. CSX which controls most of the track along the route insists that restoring Amtrak service would interfere with the six to eight freight trains it runs daily along the coast. It’s an argument that rail corporations often deploy against passenger service.

The objection is absurd on its face. During World War II when troop and military freight trains crowded this route along with civilian freight traffic long since lost to trucks dispatchers still managed to move 11 scheduled passenger trains per day between Mobile and New Orleans. These included the storied “Pan American” of country music fame. And they did it using telegraphs and hand-operated semaphores not the efficient GPS technology available today.

CSX’s recalcitrance is a negotiating strategy to get Amtrak to either go away or pony up for huge infrastructure investments that would mostly benefit CSX itself. The railroad says restoring two Amtrak trains requires a second main track new sidings siding extensions yard bypasses and modernization of drawbridges. At one point CSX put the price tag at $2 billion—orders of magnitude more than estimates provided by the Federal Railway Administration and other independent experts.

Such maneuverings reflect the growing power of hedge funds and other “activist investors” over the railroad industry. In 2017 the financier Paul Hilal used his activist fund Mantle Ridge to buy a nearly $2 billion stake in CSX and win control of its board. Hilal used this power to depose CSX’s long-standing management and replace it with a team of downsizing specialists committed to boosting short-term profits by shrinking the railroad’s physical assets labor force and other expenses. The new focus on cost cutting and downsizing has seriously degraded CSX freight operations while also causing the company to take an impossibly hard line with Amtrak.

Exasperated by the railroads’ refusal to negotiate in good faith over the restoration of Gulf Coast service Amtrak has recently appealed to an independent federal agency the Surface Transportation Board. But deregulation has left the federal government with very limited control over railroad infrastructure. When Congress and the Nixon administration created Amtrak in 1970 they relieved railroad owners of their previous obligation to provide passenger service at their own expense. Half a century later the federal government has no clear legal standard to decide when freight railroads must grant Amtrak access to their track or what the terms of service will be. And since Amtrak owns track only between Boston and Washington and a few other places dependence on freight railroads is a huge obstacle to improving or expanding passenger rail service.

For example more than 10 years of studying and lobbying have been dedicated to the question of whether Amtrak will be permitted to run more than one round-trip train per day between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. Public policy makers must wrestle with many knotty problems; this shouldn’t be one of them. There’s plenty of track capacity. Amtrak ran two round-trip trains along the mostly three-track mainline as recently as 2004. But Norfolk Southern says today that bringing back that second train would create unworkable disruptions to its freight service. The railroad’s latest maneuver was to demand that the state of Pennsylvania pay for a study to calculate how much the public must pay Norfolk Southern for the necessary capital improvements such as a possible fourth track.

Another example is the drawn-out battle Amtrak and the public had to wage to restore passenger service between Boston and Portland Maine. By the time Amtrak came into being passenger service on the route had already been discontinued. To get it started again Amtrak as well as state and local governments had to agree to pay the railroad that owns the tracks tens of millions of dollars for capital improvements. It took another two years of litigation before the railroad now known as Pan Am would allow Amtrak to run its trains fast enough so people would want to ride them. A pending mergerbetween Pan Am and CSX now threatens the public’s considerable investment in that passenger route and any prospect of expanding Amtrak service elsewhere in New England.

Biden recently signed an executive order that commanded the Surface Transportation Board to put more pressure on railroads to stop their habitual practice of delaying Amtrak trains by making them wait for passing freight trains. That’s helpful. But the order failed to clarify what rights Amtrak possesses to expand service and what price it and other public entities must pay railroad owners for capital improvements. Because there’s no clear statutory authority some industry insiders predict that Amtrak’s legal fight to restore Gulf Coast passenger service will go all the way to the Supreme Court which could take years. State and local governments seeking to establish commuter rail service have even less legal leverage than Amtrak in negotiating terms with private railroad owners.

It’s much the same story when you consider the prospects for expanding freight rail service in the U.S. Don’t expect much progress unless we claw back Wall Street control.

There’s an overwhelming societal need to divert more freight from trucks to trains. Freight trains are three to five timesmore fuel efficient than trucks and produce far less emissions. Indeed when electrically powered by overhead wires trains can be emissions free and without the environmental and financial costs of battery disposal that plague electric trucks. According to one study a modest investment in electrifying freight railroads could reduce carbon emissions by 39 percent and by 2030 remove an estimated 83 percent of long-haul trucks from the road.

Moving more freight by rail would also reduce the number of Americans who are killed or injured by collisions with large trucks a casualty rate that reached 156000 in 2018. In addition it would reduce dramatically the damage done to America’s roads and highways by large trucks—each of which causes the same wear and tear as 9600 passenger cars.

Yet hedge funds private equity firms and other financiers are using their control of highly monopolized underregulated railroads not to expand rail freight but to sell off rail assets and hand over all but the highest-margin business to trucks.

Some of this downsizing is justified by the decline of the railroads’ thermal coal business as electric utilities convert to natural gas. But most of the downsizing results simply from financiers forcing railroads to shed all but their most lucrative lines of business. Such practices threaten to shrink the nation’s rail network to the point of nonviability but so long as rail expenses fall faster than rail revenues the short-term return on assets increases. That’s all Wall Street cares about.

The scale of the downsizing is dramatic. One measure is the rapid disappearance of boxcars. During the 10 years leading up to 2019 even as GDP increased by nearly 50 percent the railroad boxcar fleet shrank by one-third. Between 2000 and 2019 the trade journalist Bill Stephens reported the equivalent of 16132 merchandise freight trains each with 75 cars vanished from the tracks of CSX and Norfolk Southern. The main driver of this decline was an industry trend known as “demarketing” in which railroads actively turn away profitable but low-margin business—for example hauling grain or consumer appliances—if the move doesn’t involve huge volumes or requires boxcars to be hauled back empty. As a consequence many farmers now have to use expensive trucks to get their crops to market while many kinds of manufacturing become far more difficult if not impossible in the rapidly expanding number of towns and cities where the railroads will no longer do business.

Railroads are also making it more expensive and cumbersome for shippers to realize any advantage from combining shipment by truck with shipment by rail. Especially for trips over about 500 miles moving containers by both truck and train is much more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly than using trucks for the entire journey. During the 1980s and ’90s railroads won substantial market share back from trucks in some lanes by offering such intermodal service. But that was before Wall Street started demanding that railroads limit themselves to the highest-margin business.

Bowing to such pressure in 2018 Union Pacific and CSX discontinued their partnered service on 197 of 301 cross-country container train routes. As a consequence even shippers who still use railroads to ship containers wind up making much greater use of trucks. For example if a shipper wants to move a container from any number of western cities to Baltimore using Union Pacific and CSX CSX will no longer move the container the full distance. Rather CSX will only take it as far as Chambersburg Pennsylvania and then make the shipper hire a trucker to haul it the remaining 100 miles to Baltimore.

Railroads have also been stripping out terminal capacity. Wonder why it took so long to get that new car you ordered? The shortage of rail terminal space is a major reason for the widespread logistical bottlenecks since the economy began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July Union Pacific suspended container freight service from West Coast ports to Chicago for a week because it lacked the capacity to sort and redirect the boxes piling up there. The embargo immediately meant that still more boxes coming from Asia with everything from auto parts to transistors piled up on docks as West Coast ports waited for canceled trains. As the chain reaction continued the steamship line HMM warned customers to expect more delays and announced restrictions on loading containers bound for Chicago. The rail expert Larry Gross calculated that it would take 50 double-stack trains each carrying 800 20-foot containers to haul away the pileup caused by just one week of suspended rail service.

Why did this bottleneck occur? In large part because to appease Wall Street’s demands for higher margins Union Pacific had previously closed a major handling facility in Chicago known as Global III that it now desperately needed to keep the supply chain moving.

Wall Street has also pressured railroads into cutting expenses by reducing the frequency of freight service. If you live near railroad tracks or if you drive regularly over grade crossings you may have noticed that railroads run freight trains much less frequently nowadays and that the trains they do run can stretch as long as three miles. The industry refers to this as “PSR” or precision scheduled railroading. In practice PSR has nothing to do making trains run on precise schedules. The term was coined by the late E. Hunter Harrison a railroad executive who starting in the 1990s boosted railroad stock prices through radical downsizing. This made him the darling of hedge funds like Pershing Square Capital Management and Mantle Ridge.

PSR mostly just involves running fewer trains to fewer places using fewer employees while imposing all kinds of new fees on shippers. After Harrison implemented PSR at CSX Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific and other railroads imitated him and freight rail operations deteriorated nationwide. In 2019 Congress held hearings in which shippers relayed example after example of paying more for worse service. Since then CSX and other railroads have taken PSR still further by ripping out yards and laying off hard-to-replace employees such as locomotive mechanics and engineers. Between 2014 and 2019 before COVID had any impact the four largest railroads laid off 30000 mostly unionized workers.

The downsizing was so great that railroads can’t meet the post-pandemic surge of freight shipments. As a consequence still more freight will crowd onto the nation’s highways. “We can’t let hedge fund managers write the rules of railroading” complained Oregon Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio chairman of the House Transportation Committee in May as he called for an investigation into the way PSR has degraded railroad freight service.

Deregulation and a retreat from antitrust enforcement also feeds the financiers’ control over railroads. Since 1980 the number of major or Class I railroads has shrunk from 33 to seven—a number that will drop to six if a proposed merger between Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern wins regulatory approval. The result is that more shippers are served by only a single railroad. There are always trucks of course but some commodities (grain and chemicals for instance) are too heavy and bulky to move economically by truck for more than short distances.

Captive shippers once could depend on the Interstate Commerce Commission to protect them from predatory pricing but in 1980 the Carter administration and Congress stripped the government of almost all its practical ability to do so. The combination of deregulation and lax antitrust enforcement leaves railroads free to hike prices or degrade service standards.

The shippers’ loss has been the railroad stockholders’ gain. Less than three years after Mantle Ridge brought in Harrison to run CSX the railroad’s stock price doubled. Today its new CEO says he’s committed to growing the business—but that isn’t necessarily the railroad business. On his watch CSX bought a trucking company and used a $5 billion stock buyback program to raise the company’s stock price and fatten his own $15 million compensation package. The stock prices of other Class I railroads have also surged thanks to cost cutting that now allows railroads to spend less than 60 cents for every dollarthey take in as revenue.

This is the industry on which Congress and Biden propose to bestow $66 billion. To protect that investment we’ll need to do a lot more.

Government played an oversized role in building the nation’s railroads. Historically railroads operated under charters granted by state and local governments that required them to serve the public good. CSX’s tracks along the Gulf Coast for example were originally laid by a corporation created by an act of Alabama’s state legislature in 1866. The legislature gave this corporation government-like powers including eminent domain to acquire rights of way across the state. But in return the legislature stipulated that the line must be built and managed in a manner “best adapted to and for the public accommodation.”

This basic relationship between railroads and the public was codified into federal law in the late 19th century and lasted until the end of the 1970s. America’s early railroads received vast grants of public land and other direct subsidies that turned them into local or regional monopolies. In return American law treated them as quasi-public utilities subject to strict price regulation and the principle known as “common carriage” which prohibited them from turning away some customers or classes of business while favoring others.

As Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote for the majority in the 1898 case of Smyth v. Ames

A railroad is a public highway and nonetheless so because constructed and maintained through the agency of a corporation deriving its existence and powers from the state. Such a corporation was created for public purposes. It performs a function of the state. Its authority to exercise the right of eminent domain and to charge tolls was given primarily for the benefit of the public.

This led to railroads being heavily regulated first by state railroad commissions and then after 1887 by the Interstate Commerce Commission the first federal regulatory agency. The ICC came to wield enormous influence over industrial development by barring railroads from favoring one shipper industry city or region over another. The agency also compelled railroads to provide certain low-margin or even money-losing lines of business such as branch lines necessary to connect smaller cities and villages to the political and economic life of the nation. By controlling rates and terms of service the ICC also prevented price wars and other ruinous competition among railroads and gave them a legal vehicle to coordinate operating plans so freight and passengers could travel efficiently across more than one railroad.

Because of the ICC and the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 railroads in that era were subject to far more regulation and antitrust enforcement than railroads face today. That’s one big reason why late-19th- and early-20th-century rail tycoons like James Hill or E. H. Harriman concentrated on building and improving railroads rather than on predatory pricing and demarketing like today’s financiers.

This regulatory regime worked reasonably well until the mid-20th century. As the political scientist Samuel Huntingtonwould write in 1952 “During its sixty-five years of existence the Commission developed an enviable reputation for honesty impartiality and expertness.” But then it began falling apart. As advancing technology expanded transportation by automobile truck and air policy makers should have adjusted transportation policy to take advantage of potential synergies. They could have encouraged for example combining trains and trucks to move long-haul freight or trains and planes to reach out-of-the-way places. Instead funding was lavished on highway and airport construction.

A telling symbol of this imbalance is Washington’s monumental Union Station built by a consortium of railroads in the beginning of the 20th century. By the early 1960s the railroads were paying property taxes on the station of $350000 a year and an annual maintenance bill of more than $1 million even as they lost money on passenger train service mandated by the ICC. Meanwhile across the Potomac airlines availed themselves of the federally owned and operated National Airport—built expanded and operated by a tangle of federal agencies that included the Civil Aeronautics Board the Army Corps of Engineers and even the National Park Service.

This imbalance led to massive railroad bankruptcies in the 1970s. Washington at that point might have nationalized the railroads as nearly every other industrialized nation had done long before. Instead it bailed out railroad stockholders by allowing railroads to shed public responsibilities such as operating passenger trains and branch lines while allowing them to engage in a mad merger frenzy.

The strategy saved much of the industry from insolvency but at a tremendous cost to the public good. Since 1980 the nation has lost more than 40 percent of its rail mileage as many lines were ripped out that would be invaluable today as we struggle to decarbonize the economy and rationalize our transportation system. And once financiers twigged that Congress had turned railroads into unregulated monopolies answerable only to shareholders they swooped in and pressured rail management to adopt policies like PSR to further downsize and squeeze out the last drops of monopoly profit.

One solution to this mess would be to nationalize the railroads. The U.S. actually did this temporarily during World War I with many impressive results. Or we could nationalize only rail infrastructure leaving private companies to operate trains. This “open access” approach has shown promising results in Europe and it’s not all that different from how the Interstate Highway System works.

Alternatively we could take a “back to the future” approach once again treating railroads as utilities but paying better attention this time to coordinating regulation and subsidies among all transportation modes including new ones like drones and self-driving cars.

The one thing we shouldn’t do however if we want to preserve planet Earth and build back a transportation network that suits our needs is give the railroad industry more money without demanding that it serve the public interest. The looting has gone on long enough.

As per the agreement Port Manatee Railroad LLC will be operated as a subsidiary of Kennett Square Pennsylvania-based Regional Rail.

The railroad at the port began operation in 1970 and encompasses over 7 miles of tracks directly connected with the mainline of Jacksonville Florida-based CSX Transportation. The railroad also operates a pair of energy-efficient locomotives and can offer enough capacity to accommodate 300 railcars.

“Port Manatee as central and southwest Florida’s preferred gateway for global commerce enthusiastically welcomes this new mutually beneficial relationship with Regional Rail” said Reggie Bellamy Chairman of the Manatee County Port Authority. “We anticipate enjoying many years of synergistic growth.”

Al Sauer President and Chief Executive Officer of Regional Rail added “We are very proud and excited to have been chosen to be the new operator for the rail infrastructure within Port Manatee. This operation is in close proximity to our existing Florida railroads and we are looking forward to working with Port Manatee and with CSX to strengthen and expand the rail service offerings to existing customers within Port Manatee and to attract new business to the port.”

This agreement is effective from 1 December 2021.

This comes after the news that LOGISTEC USA Inc. has ordered two new eco-efficient Konecranes Gottwald Generation 6 Mobile Harbour cranes to help reduce its marine carbon footprint and enhance container handling at its container terminal within the port.

The order for this new machinery was booked in August 2021 and comes as the terminal anticipates increase levels of traffic. Delivery is scheduled to be completed by February 2022.",,,,,,,,,

The engine was introduced in China earlier this year and can be paired with a Cummins Eaton Automated Transmission Technologies Endurant HD Transmission and Cummins Fuel Delivery System ensuring a purpose-built and fully integrated natural gas powertrain. The 15-liter engine will offer ratings up to 500 horsepower and 1850 foot pounds of torque and is expected to weigh 500 pounds less than comparable 15-liter diesel engines currently available on the market while not requiring Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to meet 2024 California or Environmental Protection Agency emission standards.

“As I’ve talked to end customers they are very excited about this product and in particular as they pursue their own goals for carbon reduction” said Jennifer Rumsey Cummins president and CEO. “In the coming years they see natural gas as a great way to meet those including using renewable natural gas. So we expect some upside opportunities as we bring that new platform into the market and also some growing interest to natural gas in the market.”

The 15-liter natural gas engine is part of Cummins strategy for its path to zero emissions. It can run on either natural gas or hydrogen something Cummins officials said makes it a versatile offering to heavy-duty truck makers depending on their chosen environmentally friendly engine.

“The 15-liter natural gas engine is an important part of our path to zero emission strategy by offering a significant reduction in both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases in a product that’s available today and utilizes existing infrastructure” said Tom Linebarger Cummins chairman and CEO during a recent conference call with investor analysts.

“Equally exciting is that this engine is designed to accept a range of gases and renewable fuels including hydrogen in the future. In fact all of Cummins’ engine platforms are being designed with the same fuel flexibility. At the same time we are working with Chevron and others in the energy industry to increase the availability of renewable natural gas and other renewable fuels to ensure infrastructure is in place to meet our customers needs.”

One analyst question focused on Cummins’ dual-track development of electric fuel cells and hydrogen engines given Cummins’ ability to convert a 15-liter internal combustion engine to burn hydrogen. Linebarger said the investment in both hydrogen and electric engines allows Cummins to be flexible in what it offers to potential customers.

Hydrogen can be a short-term answer for some customers who may switch to fuel cells later as the technology evolves.

“If you have a relatively short range or you have a vocational truck our view is maybe a hydrogen engine might work for you especially if the conversion to fuel cell is too expensive and you’re not having that many units” Linebarger said. “So our view is there’s a place for both but if you want to think what’s going to really drive the transportation economy 20 years — 15 years — from now you’re going to need the efficiency that a fuel cell especially with an electric system is going to provide. So our feeling still is fuel cells win for the majority of the trucking industry but hydrogen engines are a real addition to the portfolio of products that can be available across our markets.”

In that vein Cummins has signed a letter of intent to acquire 50% equity in Momentum Fuel Technologies from Rush Enterprises. The joint venture will produce Cummins-branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America. Momentum Fuels Technologies’ specializes in compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems.

“And there’s a time factor too as you can imagine” Rumsey said. “As fuel cells advanced and costs come down and maybe there are period of time where hydrogen engines are having an economic advantage but as Tom said over time costs come down that efficiency benefit for customers that are really driven strictly by total costs on ownership we think will drive a shift toward fuel cell and applications like Line Haul.”

In other new technology developments Cummins is launching a set of software features to integrate its powertrains with Automated Driving System (ADS) technologies. Cummins is actively testing more than 100 vehicles in coordination with automated driving systems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYXUubGlmZXN0eWxlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZXZlcnRvbi12cy10b3R0ZW5oYW0tbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW0tMTAwMjE4MzA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everton vs Tottenham live stream: How can I watch Premier League game on TV in UK today?,"Everton vs Tottenham live stream: How can I watch Premier League game on TV in UK today?

The Antonio Conte era truly begins for Tottenham Hotspur today.

While of course the Italian was in charge for Thursday’s dramatic win over Vitesse Arnhem in the Europa Conference League Sunday’s meeting with Everton will perhaps provide a better reflection of what he’s been able to do so far.

Clearly these are still early days and it would be foolish to draw any definitive conclusions just yet but having trained over the last few days Conte’s ideas might be better implemented than they were earlier this week.

A trip up to Goodison Park to face an Everton side to have conceded seven goals in their last two Premier League outings awaits as Conte returns to the top flight of English football for the first time since May 2018.

With the Champions League spots in sight it will be fascinating to see how Conte sets his team up.

Chasing 158 for victory Australia rode on a 124-run second-wicket stand between Warner and Mitchell Marsh to romp home in 16.2 overs in Abu Dhabi and go level with Group 1 leaders England on eight points.

Marsh who hit 53 of 32 balls got out to Chris Gayle who celebrated the wicket in what was his likely swansong in West Indies colours.

Earlier Josh Hazlewood took four wickets to keep West Indies down to 157 for seven despite skipper Kieron Pollard's 44 in the Super 12 clash.

South Africa play England who are all but through to the final four in the evening match and the result will decide the two semi-finalists this group.

South Africa need a dominant win to improve their run rate and edge out Australia. England can only miss out on the final four if they lose heavily.

Reigning champions West Indies failed to give a winning farewell to Dwayne Bravo who played his last international.

Australia gave Bravo and Gayle a guard of honour after Warner hit the winning runs.

Pollard rescued his side who failed to defend their title after a loss to Sri Lanka took them out of the semi-final race from 91-5 with his 31-ball knock and a key partnership of 35 with Bravo.

Bravo who remains the leading wicket-taker in T20 matches with 553 scalps scored 10 and walked back to claps and hugs.

Andre Russell finished off the innings with two sixes off Mitchell Starc in his unbeaten 18 off seven balls.

Openers Evin Lewis and Gayle started in attacking mode hitting the Australian pace bowlers to all parts of the ground in an opening stand of 30 off 14 balls.

Lewis smashed Hazlewood for three successive boundaries.

Gayle hit two sixes including one off Pat Cummins before the bowler got the veteran big-hitter to chop a delivery onto the stumps.

The 42-year-old West Indies great made 15 off nine balls and walked back to a standing ovation from his teammates.

Hazlewood came back with a bang with twin strikes as he sent back Nicholas Pooran and Roston Chase bowled for nought in the space of three deliveries to leave the West Indies teetering at 35-3.

The left-handed pair of Lewis and Shimron Hetmyer who made 27 fought back with a partnership of 35 but Adam Zampa broke the stand with his leg-spin.

He got Lewis out for 29.

In reply Warner came attacking and unsettled the West Indian attack with boundaries all around the park despite losing opening partner Aaron Finch for nine.

Marsh was equally punishing of the bowlers as he hit five fours and two sixes in his fifth T20 fifty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYmFyYmFkb3N0b2RheS5iYi8yMDIxLzExLzA3L3d0bS1oYWlsZWQtYS1odWdlLXN1Y2Nlc3MtZm9yLWJhcmJhZG9zL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vYmFyYmFkb3N0b2RheS5iYi8yMDIxLzExLzA3L3d0bS1oYWlsZWQtYS1odWdlLXN1Y2Nlc3MtZm9yLWJhcmJhZG9zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WTM hailed a huge success for Barbados,"Barbados continues to be the top performing destination for many key tour operator partners across the United Kingdom many of whom have stated that 2022 is well positioned to be their best performing year in Barbados in terms of room nights and revenue generated.

Many operators advised that the relaxation of Barbados’ entry protocols resulted in increased interest and an immediate surge in bookings to Barbados. Booking patterns have changed significantly with evidence of shorter windows approximately four – six weeks. This creates an opportunity to capitalise on last minute bookings and a further opportunity to switch sell.

The Barbados delegation met with 30 UK-based travel trade partners over the three-day event including airlines tour operators and representatives from the travel agent community. Key partners of note included Virgin Atlantic British Airways Aer Lingus TUI Caribtours Tropical Sky Hays Travel Lotus Dial-a-Flight and Trailfinders.

From the 1st to the 3rd of November Barbados attended World Travel Market one of the leading annual events for the international travel sector hosted in the ExCel Centre London for three days of meetings with partners media suppliers agents and operators from the UK Ireland and Europe.

The Barbados delegation was led by Minister for Tourism and International Travel Lisa Cummins. The Minister was joined by CEO of Barbados Marketing Tourism Inc. (BTMI) Jens Thraenhart; BTMI Chairman Roseanne Myers; BHTA Chairman Geoffery Roach; BTMI Director Europe Anita Nightingale; and BTMI Interim Head of Global Markets Cheryl Carter.

UK travellers have been found to be spending more on holidays now including premium seats booking higher categories of accommodation excursions and staying longer within destinations. Not only will this have a positive impact on the average length of stay but will also have a positive impact on visitor spend in Barbados.

World2Meet (W2M) announced that it will be operating a chartered service from Madrid Spain in July 2022 using an A350 with 432 seats. Two days of operation have been confirmed to date July 5 and 12 with more under consideration. TUI Discovery announced it will base one vessel in Barbados in Winter 2021/22 with a further 2 ships currently scheduled for 2022/23.

As consumer confidence returns tour operators have expressed an interest in supporting key niche markets of focus for Barbados including Halal Health and Wellness Weddings and Honeymoons African Diaspora. Several operators expressed great interest in the West Indies/England cricket series in Barbados currently scheduled for January and March 2022 was expressed by several operators.

The media interest in Barbados was visible throughout the three-day London event. BTMI’s PR representatives met with over 30 media from across the United Kingdom and Ireland solidifying relationships and securing media coverage for the upcoming year.

Minister Cummins did several interviews over the course of the three days with a number of media including the Financial Times BBC Business Traveller Magazine Travel Weekly ABTA magazine and TravelMole.

In these interviews Minister Cummins discussed the increased capacity to Barbados from the UK including Aer Lingus’ new route from Manchester and the upcoming inaugural Virgin Atlantic flight from Edinburgh to Bridgetown. Minister Cummins also spoke about the opening of new and redeveloped attractions restaurants and hotels on the island the travel protocols for international arrivals and her vision for the future of tourism on the island.

It was a successful introduction to BTMI for new Chief Executive Officer Jens Thraenhart as he was awarded a Global Tourism Hero Award by Juergen Steinmetz of the World Tourism Network. This award recognises those that have shown extraordinary leadership innovation and actions within the travel industry. Thraenhart was awarded this accolade for his amazing achievements in the industry including his time as the Mekong Tourism Organization Chairman.

On Wednesday World Travel Market announced the very best stands of the conference in which Barbados Tourism Marketing was highly commended for its “good use of colour which gave a real feel for the country” according to the panel of four expert independent judges.

CVS,CVS Health,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8va2Fuc2FzcmVmbGVjdG9yLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzA3L2N2cy1zb21ldGltZXMtZm9yY2VzLXBlb3BsZS10by11c2UtaXRzLXBoYXJtYWNpZXMtbm93LXRoZS1zdXByZW1lLWNvdXJ0LXdpbGwtd2VpZ2gtaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS sometimes forces people to use its pharmacies. Now the Supreme Court will weigh in • Kansas Reflector,"CVS Health and other massive corporations often use their pharmacy middleman subsidiaries to force people to get the most expensive class of drugs from the businesses’ own mail-order pharmacies.

Some call the practice “patient steering.”

CVS and companies such as UnitedHealth and ExpressScripts/Cigna say the arrangements save patients money. But some patients oncologists and other health providers say it threatens lives.

Now the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to weigh in. In a little more than a month it will hear arguments in a California case in which AIDS patients are claiming the practice discriminates against them.

Known as “pharmacy benefit managers” or PBMs the middlemen work with insurance companies or government programs like Medicare and Medicaid to facilitate prescription-drug transactions. They negotiate rebates with drugmakers decide what drugs are covered and they determine how much to reimburse pharmacies that dispense drugs as part of their health plans.

But the function that’s in dispute in the California case is how PBMs structure their pharmacy networks.

Each of the big three PBMs is affiliated with a major insurer and each is part of a corporation that is among the 13 largest in the United States. And the combined PBMs are estimated to control well over 70% of the pharmacy-middleman marketplace.

They’re also frequently in direct competition with the retail pharmacies whose reimbursements they control. CVS owns the nation’s largest retail chain and each of the big three owns a mail-order pharmacy for “specialty drugs” — the most expensive class of medicines which can cost upward of $100000 a year.

Increasingly the big-three PBMs have been saying they won’t cover super-expensive specialty drugs if patients get them at their oncology centers or their AIDS clinics. It’s increasingly the case that the only way PBMs will cover them is if patients get them through the mail from a PBM-owned pharmacy.

Critics say the point is to pad profits but the PBMs maintain that they do this to help their customers.

“To keep costs down plan designs offered by pharmacy benefit managers often impose the most restrictions on ‘specialty’ drugs” CVS said in its petition asking the Supreme Court to take up the case. “These medications have special shipping administration or storage requirements; treat rare conditions; or are very expensive.”

It added “Pharmacy benefit managers often control the disproportionate costs and complexities of specialty drugs by contracting with specialty pharmacies that have expertise in the ‘unique handling storage and dispensing’ requirements of these medications. Increasingly pharmacy benefit managers rely on specialty pharmacies that deliver by mail.”

Cancer HIV patients say mail-order service doesn’t work

However many patients complain that especially when they have complex conditions that require equally complex drug regimens mail-order service is vastly inferior to the services they get in-person from pharmacy professionals.

In 2018 Elvin Weir a now-deceased cancer patient described to The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch how late or improperly filled mail-order cancer prescriptions had often delayed the rest of his treatment as his disease worsened. And officials at oncology centers said the arrangement disrupts the collaboration between their pharmacists and oncologists treating conditions that can be not only complex but also change rapidly.

The plaintiffs in the original California case made much the same argument.

“For people living with HIV/AIDS strict lifetime adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ART) consisting of complex combinations of pharmaceuticals consumed daily is vitally important and can be literally a life-or-death matter” the AIDS Healthcare Foundation wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief.

“For people living with HIV/AIDS so-called specialty pharmacies and pharmacists that focus on HIV/AIDS and in-person treatment provide demonstrably superior care than do mail-order pharmacies and retail pharmacies” it added. “Coercing people living with HIV/AIDS into using only mail-order pharmacies is thus guaranteeing inferior care and worse health outcomes and is disability discrimination by both intent and impact.”

A panel of the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals last December said that among its mistakes the lower court in the CVS case didn’t acknowledge that face-to-face interactions with pharmacists were part of the benefits to which plan members are entitled.

The Ninth Circuit ruled that CVS’s mail-order policy might discriminate against the disabled because it “burdens HIV/AIDS patients differently because of their unique pharmaceutical needs. Specifically they claim that changes in medication to treat the continual mutation of the virus requires pharmacists to review all of an HIV/AIDS patient’s medications for side effects and adverse drug interactions a benefit they no longer receive under the program.”

CVS argues policies don’t intentionally discriminate

In its appeal to the Supreme Court CVS is disputing the plaintiffs’ legal argument that the mail-order policy violates the law because it has a “disparate impact.”

In other words the AIDS-afflicted plaintiffs are saying that even if on its face the policy applies equally to everybody it’s still illegal discrimination if it has a discriminatory effect against part of a protected group: the disabled. CVS on the other hand is arguing that so long as its policies aren’t intentionally discriminatory they’re OK.

The law puts “federal-funding recipients on notice that intentional discrimination is illegal” its petition says. “Schools cannot discipline students with attention-deficit disorder more harshly on that basis. Towns cannot target group homes for individuals with disabilities with uniquely onerous zoning requirements. Employers cannot refuse to hire someone solely because she is in a wheelchair. And health plans and anyone else subject to (federal health care laws) cannot facially exclude patients with disabilities simply because they have disabilities.”

“Courts do not need to rewrite (the law) and insert a nonexistent disparate-impact standard to accomplish Congress’ goals” CVS argued.

The health care company noted that appellate courts have issued differing opinions in the matter. That presumably is the dispute the Supreme Court hopes to settle by taking up the case.

Oral arguments are slated for Dec. 7.

On Friday (5 November) night the 79-year-old appeared at his first in-person event in two years at the Southbank Centre to promote his new book The Lyrics.

During the event McCartney spoke to host Sara Ahmed also spoke about “growing up together” with Lennon in Liverpool.

“You know as 16-year-old 17-year-old Liverpool kids you could never say that it just wasn’t done. So I never did” McCartney said when asked if he’d told Lennon that he “loved” him while he was alive.

“I never really just said ‘John love you man.’ I never got around to it… So now it’s just great to realise how much I love this man.”

McCartney also compared his childhood with Lennon to “walking up a staircase and we both went side by side up that staircase”.

He added: “I just remember how great it was to work with him and how great he was. Because you are not messing around here you are not just singing with Joe Bloggs. You are singing with John Lennon.”

Elsewhere in the event McCartney shared his thoughts on Rishi’s Sunak’s recent budget pledge that £2m would go towards making another Beatles museum in Liverpool.

“I don’t mind because I know that people from Japan America South America all know The Beatles” McCartney said.

“So I’m quite happy that they’re recognising that it’s a tourist attraction but I think they could also spend the money on something else.”

The unnamed 16-year-old was at a traffic stop on Interstate 75 in southern Kentucky Thursday afternoon when she made the gesture according to Fox 8 News. She was a passenger in a Toyota Camry being driven by her apparent abductor.

According to the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office the motion — a fist enclosed across the thumb placed in front of the palm — “represents violence at home – I need help – domestic violence.”

A driver saw the SOS and called 911 following the Camry and providing authorities updates on their location.

The older man was later identified as 61-year-old James Herbert Brick of Cherokee North Carolina who was reportedly on his way to see relatives in Ohio.

Brick’s phone contained a photo of a girl being portrayed in a sexual manner police said.

He was taken to the Laurel County Correctional Center and charged with unlawful imprisonment and possession of matter showing sex performances by a minor.

The teen had been reported missing by her family on Tuesday. Laurel County Deputy Gilbert Acciardo said she had initially gone willingly with Brick. At some point though “I think she started fearing for her life” Acciardo said according to the Lexington Herald-Leader.

But as more and more people get back into the groove of flying airfare prices are rising accordingly. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby recently warned travelers that they are likely to see price hikes soon especially with a major increase in travel over the holidays. Experts say there are things you can do to avoid making your trip even more expensive and one comes down to the way you book your ticket. Read on to find out what you should never do when booking a flight on United or Delta.

Don't wait to book your ticket for a United flight at the airport.

A Sept. 21 TikTok video that claims buying flight tickets at the airport counter for some airlines may net cheaper prices went viral earning more than 60000 likes and one million views. But experts are now warning that for many major airlines this advice is too good to be true. According to travel agency company CheapOair buying a ticket for a United flight at the airport won't yield cheaper prices and may end up costing you more as airfares tend to rise over time.

""United Airlines tickets are never cheaper at the airport"" the travel agency states. ""Online flight booking can help you save big on airfare as flight booking sites offer various deals and discounts and promo codes on flight booking. You can make use of the market competition in your favor and can search for the cheapest tickets. On the other hand it is very rare that one is able to get any exciting offers on flight booking at the airport.""

Delta flights shouldn't be booked at the airport either.

Experts say the same rules apply when booking a flight for another major airline: Delta. According to Delta's website there are several fees that could be imposed on top of the base fare for your ticket but none of them are online-exclusive. The airline says they are ""committed to offering you the lowest fare for Delta flights"" when you book directly from them in any way ""including on delta.com or via the Fly Delta app."" In fact if you find a lower price anywhere within 24 hours of purchasing your ticket the airline says you can cancel it and receive a full refund.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

""Delta flights when you buy at the airport are never cheaper"" travel agency FlyCoAir confirms on its website.

Some budget airlines might offer cheaper tickets if you buy at the airport.

If you're booking a ticket from Allegiant Frontier or Spirit you may want to consider buying directly from the airport however. According to Airfarewatchdog an online site where experts monitor airfare prices these three airlines do charge a fee for the convenience of booking online.

Allegiant Airlines has an ""Electronic Carrier Usage Charge"" which costs $18 each way when booking online but not at the airport while Frontier imposes a $4 to $21 ""Carrier Interface Charge"" each way on nearly all of its fares booked online. Spirit Airlines' online fee is called the ""Passenger Usage Charge"" and can cost people buying tickets online up to $22.99 each way.

""These carrier-imposed fees go unnoticed by most because they are often lumped in with all of the government-imposed taxes and fees which makes them seem like a mandatory charge"" experts explain.

But booking at the airport might make you ineligible for certain online discounts.

It's essential to do your own research for each plane ticket you buy as some of these budget airlines also offer online-exclusive discounts. According to Airfarewatchdog Allegiant Airlines offers a ""roundtrip discount"" for tickets booked on its website which might not get applied to tickets booked directly at the airport. This airline also offers discounted bag fees online which you cannot get if you purchase your ticket at the airport.

""If you need either a checked bag or a carry-on bag this price difference for luggage will likely wipe out any savings you made by purchasing your ticket at the airport"" the experts say. Both Frontier and Spirit also offer online-exclusive bundles or discounts for some flights and charge higher bag fees at the airport. But these two airports might also assign your seats for free if you order your ticket at the airport.

""For many it is incredibly inconvenient to go to the airport just to purchase a ticket. Airports are usually hard to get to and generally far from city centers. Make sure to factor in your time getting to and from the airport and waiting in line to purchase a ticket. Add on to that the cost of more expensive bag fees gas or transportation plus any parking fees and you may find the actual savings to not be worth the hassle"" the experts at Airefarewatchdog say.

Just days before entry to the US is set to be made easier for travelers around the world Delta Airlines have reported a surge in activity that suggests travelers are taking advantage of the restrictions easing for the first time this pandemic. From November 8th new regulations surrounding entry to the US will go live making travel to the country easier for non-citizens from the UK and countries within the EU whilst also making returning home easier for American travelers heading in the other direction.

The latest findings prove that demand for travel is high amongst those in the US with international travel figures set to rise once more alongside domestic travel figures which have remained high in the US despite staff shortages and sporadic mass cancelations. Here's a look at the demand for international travel and a reminder of what is set to change tomorrow.

International Bookings Soar – Information For Travelers

After this year's much-heralded travel-packed summer of travel failed to get off the ground thanks to the rapid spread of the Delta variant it comes as little surprise that Americans have been itching to get on an airplane and travel the world once more. With cases falling levels of vaccination rising and entry restrictions dropping in most parts of the world it seems like there could well be a winter of travel on the cards for many American travelers.

Delta Airlines have all but confirmed this will be the case by revealing just how much the demand for travel has hit their airline. According to Delta the six weeks following the announcement that the US would be reopening saw a 450% in international bookings compared to the six week period before the announcement was made.

Delta is set to find themselves front and center of the demand for travel with the airline operating as many as 139 flights from 55 international destinations – across 38 countries – that are set to land in the United States on the day the restrictions are eased with a passenger capacity that exceeds 25000 seats. This will be achieved through connection with its international partner airlines which include the likes of Air France KLM and Virgin Atlantic.

Delta have also recently streamlined their entry requirements for international travelers in order to try and combat long wait times and queues during what is set to be a manic period of travel. This news is set to be a relief to many travelers who have been told to expect waiting times of up to eight hours in some of the busier airports in the US.

Speaking about the restrictions easing Delta's Chief Executive Ed Bastian said:

“This is the start of a new era for travel and for many people around the world who have not been able to see loved ones for almost two years. While we have seen many countries reopen their borders to American visitors over the summer our international customers have not been able to fly with us or visit the United States. All of that changes now.”

From tomorrow fully vaccinated citizens and residents and foreigners will need proof of vaccination along with an antigen test taken within three days of travel. Unvaccinated citizens and residents will need an antigen test taken within 24 hours of travel. Unvaccinated foreigners will not be able to enter.

I think what makes my approach different is I lay out the theory behind my valuations I explain a lot of the moving pieces and I present a comparison between my valuations and the valuations others are giving.

I first laid this out the value of frequent flyer miles in 2014 and then updated values in 2016 2017 and 2019.

I skipped 2020 due to the pandemic but a tremendous amount has changed. Air Canada launched a new program with the same name (raising redemption prices but eliminating fuel surcharges) Delta and United devalued partner awards more than once Capital One launched transferrable points mostly at 1:1 and new program Bilt entered the transferable points space – to name just a few things.

Remember When A Mile Was Worth Two Cents?

Miles used to be thought to be worth 2 cents. I think that conventional wisdom developed out of the idea that a cross country flight cost about $500… or 25000 miles. 25 years ago that was generally true and award availability wasn’t really a problem either.

That was long before:

Airline alliances opened up huge possibilities to earn miles.

Mileage programs increased the cost of many awards.

Awards became tougher to get with flights full.

Plus the 2 cent number probably wasn’t ever a true value of miles to begin with since those flights didn’t earn miles or credit towards elite status and couldn’t be upgraded but on the other hand might be used for expensive last minute tickets.

Fast forward and the CEO of Delta talks about their miles being worth a penny. When American Airlines awards a mile for travel they book one cent of liability on their books under accounting rules adopted for 2018. Those rules required the airline to accrue the expected value of transportation to be provided in exchange for their miles.

The genius of miles is that they are worth more to consumers than they cost an airline to issue because frequent flyer programs are the largest purchasers of airline seats. They buy distressed inventory at a huge volume discount and sell those seats to us for points.

How to Think About The Value of Frequent Flyer Miles

Here’s how to think about the value of miles and points by airline hotel and credit card program.

It depends on how you redeem them. What value are you going to get for your points? The important thing here is not to use the retail price of a ticket you’re getting since

with premium cabin rewards you might not have been willing to spend that much cash. Frequent flyer tickets aren’t necessarily worth as much as a paid ticket. They don’t earn miles. They may not be upgradeable. And you can’t necessarily just pick whatever flight you want you have to be flexible and worry about award availability.

It depends on when you’re going to redeem them. You don’t earn a rate of return on miles and points like you might with cash in a bank or investment account. And you need to discount to present value if you’re going to use the points later. Plus there’s substantial risk of devaluation with many points currencies.

It depends on how many you already have. The value of points at the margin is different than an overall average value. As you approach having enough points for an award the marginal value of a few more points goes up substantially — since those extra points are what make the award possible. On the other hand once you have more points than you’ll redeem in the near-term the value of additional points falls since you may not ever use them or may not use them under current award charts.

The value of a mile is the amount at which you are indifferent to holding miles versus cash.

If a mile is ‘worth’ 2 cents you should be equally happy with a mile or two pennies if you’re offered a mile at a price of 1.9 cents you would be a buyer — you’d consider yourself to be earning a 5% margin.

Put another way when we put a charge on a credit card that doesn’t earn any bonuses (it earns 1 mile per dollar spent) we’re effectively buying that mile for 2 cents since the opportunity cost is putting the charge on a 2% cash back card. You’re revealing a preference through your behavior that you believe the mile is worth two cents.

Here Are the Valuations

The most valuable points at the top of my currency list are transferrable points. That American Express Chase Citi and Capital One (Venture/Spark Miles) points. You can transfer those into a variety of programs. Earning those gives you tremendous flexibility and optionality.

I’ve given two different values for Chase’s Ultimate Rewards which are transferable to miles and points. The higher value applies to those customers with a Sapphire Reserve or J.P. Morgan Reserve card who can redeem their points against certain categories of charges at 1.5 cents apiece in cash (versus 1.25 cents apiece for other Ultimate Rewards cards with transferable points).

How to Use These Valuations

Since valuation here is the amount at which you are indifferent to holding miles versus cash this figure is useful for:

Comparing when to spend miles or cash. Should I spend 50000 miles for an award ticket or $700?

Should I spend 50000 miles for an award ticket or $700? Comparing when to spend on airline’s miles versus another for the same award. Should I spend 25000 United miles or 35000 Delta miles?

Should I spend 25000 United miles or 35000 Delta miles? Comparing the value of different credit card signup bonuses. Is an 80000 point offer from Marriott better than a 75000 point offer from Hilton? In fact I view a 50000 point offer from Chase Sapphire Preferred better than both.

Is an 80000 point offer from Marriott better than a 75000 point offer from Hilton? In fact I view a 50000 point offer from Chase Sapphire Preferred better than both. Determining which hotel chain offers the better value reward when you’re considering staying at two different hotels. Should you spend 12000 Hyatt points or 35000 Hilton points?

Should you spend 12000 Hyatt points or 35000 Hilton points? Deciding whether to buy points when there’s a big bonus promotion.

Figuring out how much extra you might be willing to spend to earn points through a bonus promotion or figure out whether a hotel promotion should influence your decision about where to stay

But since the value of miles isn’t precise I won’t actually pay 1.3 cents for an American mile. I want to accumulate American miles when they’re substantially less costly than 1.3 cents apiece. And I know I am clearly not a buyer at 2.5 cents.

In practice these are fairly blunt tools that tell me “1 cent a point for American miles is a really good deal” but that I’m not going to spend 2 cents unless there’s a very specific scenario — like a few points at the margin to top off an account for an award I’ve put on hold — where it makes sense (and in that scenario my valuation of each point is higher since they’re helping me to save with a real redemption).

How My Valuations Compare to Others

I thought it would be interesting to compare side-by-side how One Mile at a Time and how The Points Guy value miles in comparison to my valuations.

I think you’ll find that I value most currencies a bit lower than others do. That’s perhaps because I’m not saying just what can you buy with the miles but I’m taking a discount for time (when will you use them? they don’t earn a rate of return like cash does) a volume discount (if you have a lot the value of the marginal mile falls pulling down the average) and a risk discount (miles are more likely to devalue than US dollars). I have a stronger preference for holding cash than miles than others do.

Overall I’d say that Lucky’s valuations are closer to mine than the TPG team’s are. For avoidance of doubt I’ll add as well that I have never taken payment for my valuation numbers and I’ve never felt that I need big numbers to make exaggerated claims about the value of a credit card.

As COP26 looks at the devastating impact of climate change attention has turned to our homes and the amount of energy they consume.

From installing insulation and solar panels to replacing gas boilers with heat pumps an energy efficient home is cheaper to run while minimising the impact on the environment.

Daniel Copley Consumer Spokesperson at Zoopla said: ""With COP26 bringing a renewed focus to the importance of being environmentally friendly it's the perfect time to take steps to improve the energy efficiency of your home or even consider purchasing an eco-friendly property.

One recent report from Rightmove revealed that upgrading from an F to a C rating added around 16% to the price of a property.

While this means higher prices for buyers Tim Bannister Rightmove’s Director of Property Data believes it's a premium many are willing to pay.

He said: ""Our study suggests the longer-term value upgrading the rating of your home’s Energy Performance Certificate can have when it comes to the time to sell.""

So from spacious family homes to a one-bedroom flat here are six eco-conscious future-looking properties on the market in Devon right now whatever your budget.

Need to know: The company’s needle-free patch uses tiny biosensors to measure interstitial fluid glucose levels just under the surface of the skin. The device also features an integrated display for real-time feedback.

According to Biolinq the coin-sized patch aims to simplify diabetes management and transform future consumer health and wellness applications with CEO Rich Yang adding:

“We now have an opportunity to expand the sensing category and deliver a new generation of sensing capabilities that can reach millions of lives in the diabetes community and beyond.”

The business of glucose monitoring. As we detailed in Issue No. 142 America is facing a metabolic health crisis.

In the US the total economic cost of obesity is $1.72T per year.

40% of US adults are obese and 100M Americans have diabetes/prediabetes.

Diabetes-related medical costs and productivity loss will exceed $600B by 2030.

Offing a potential solution glucose monitoring is going mainstream.

Levels ($12M) GraphWare ($20.5M) Supersapiens ($13.5M) January AI ($8.8M) and Veri ($4M) have recently secured funding.

Dexcom and Garmin partnered to display blood glucose on devices.

Apple has long been rumored to be adding glucose tracking to its smartwatch.

Looking ahead: Like all new technology continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) will encounter growing pains. But mirroring a broader trend in digital health—personalized tailored approaches to care—diabetes tech may hold powerful health insights for a wider market.",,,,,,,,,,,,

They said the rare find in the ancient city which was buried in ash when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. appeared to be in an excellent state of preservation.

Earlier this year a perfectly intact ceremonial chariot was also uncovered at the site in southern Italy. Archaeologists believe the room likely housed slaves who were charged with maintaining the chariot.

What was found in the room?

The 16-square-meter (170-square-foot) room had three wooden beds ceramic pitchers and a chamber pot.

Two beds were about 1.7 meters long (nearly 5 feet 7 inches) and one just 1.4 meters. The room had only one small window.

In the corners of the room there were amphorae — a type of container — that seemingly belonged to the master of the house. Officials believe slaves kept their belongings in two amphorae under the beds.

The archaeologists also found a wooden box in the middle of the room and a drawbar leaning against the bed.

Nearby a wooden chest contained metallic objects and textiles that “appear to be parts of harnesses for horses” according to the Pompeii archeological park.

A ‘window’ on daily life of enslaved

Officials hailed the discovery as a rare insight into slavery and the daily life of the enslaved.

“This is a window into the precarious reality of people who rarely appear in historical sources written almost exclusively by men belonging to the elite” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel Pompeii’s director general.

The “unique testimony” into how “the weakest in the ancient society lived … is certainly one of the most exciting discoveries in my life as an archaeologist” Zuchtriegel said in a press release.

The room was discovered during a dig at a suburban villa. “We did not expect to find such a room. Yet we often walked past it” said Zuchtriegel who was born in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg.

“This new important discovery enriches our understanding of the everyday life of the ancient Pompeians especially that class in society about which little is still known” Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said.

Here we bring you highlights of events that happened during the week -from the capital market to the mainstream business activities while not forgetting the tech/economy build up.

Here are the Headlines:

Nigerian govt to borrow N250bn for road projects

Squid game crypto currency crashes creators steal users’ $3.38m

Airtel MTN get licenses to operate as Payment Service Banks

Nigerian banks discovered N122.8m worth of fake Naira notes in two years

Summary:

The Debt Management Office (DMO) said on Tuesday it would issue new sovereign Sukuk valued between N200 and N250 billion before the end of the year to fund vital road projects across the country.

This is the highest sum that the Nigerian government would raise from a single Sukuk issuance and the fourth since 2017.

For three straight years now the Federal Government through the DMO has raised a total of N362.57 billion from sovereign Sukuk in oversubscribed issuance deals.

Founders of Squid Game inspired cryptocurrency which bears the same name have defrauded its investors of $3.38 million as the asset’s value crashed to $0 this week.

The crypto had been trading around $2861 before the crash as the anonymous creators lured in investors since October 20 with a promise of making available game-like Squid with winners getting Squid tokens as compensation.

Prior to the crash cryptocurrency listing platform CoinMarketCap had warned prospective buyers of Squid tokens to be vigilant and conduct due diligence before investing in the new crypto asset which rose to fame on the back of the famous Netflix series.

Two major telecommunication companies in the country Airtel and MTN Nigeria have been granted licenses to operate as Payment Service Banks (PSB) within Nigeria.

Both companies have secured approval in principle for the PSB license from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) – but this doesn’t portend well for Nigerian banks.

In separate statements announcing the CBN’s decision to extend the banking hall to the telecoms market MTN and Airtel stated that they now await the handing over of the license to commence their PSB operation.

Commercial banks in Nigeria intercepted N122.83 million worth of fake Naira notes in circulation in two years.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) disclosed this in its 2020 annual report published on its website.

Ripples Nigeria obtained the report on the apex bank’s website on Saturday.

Shari Roberson.

Mansfield Police officers responded to the scene as well as staff from the Richland County Coroner’s Office. The preliminary investigation does not indicate that foul play was involved.

On Sunday Tom Stortz a Richland County coroner's investigator said the man's death was a suicide.

Robertson said police appreciate all those who assisted in attempting to locate Dodson including citizens and the volunteers from the Ohio Special Response Team.

Friday the Mansfield Police Department asked for the public's help in locating the 25-year-old man who hadn't been seen since Thursday morning.

Dodson was last seen at his home on Willowbrook Drive around 11:30 a.m. Thursday. His family had not heard from him since that time.

The family advised Dodson would have left the residence on foot as he did not have a vehicle nor did he drive. Family members further advised he may have been in possession of a handgun that was also discovered to be missing from the home.

It is about 40 percent. The article has been corrected.

BRADFORD Pa. — Dustin Snyder was tired of the low wages the 60-hour workweeks and the impossible-to-please customers and so in early September the assistant general manager at a McDonald’s here drafted a petition that laid bare months of building anger and frustration.

“We are all leaving” his petition threatened “and hope you find employees that want to work for $9.25 an hour.” Nearly all of his two dozen employees had signed it. A few added their own flourishes.

“We need a RAISE” one scribbled next to her signature.

“Piss off” wrote another.

Dustin 21 could feel his heart pounding in his chest as he fed the petition into the fax machine in the McDonald’s office punched in the number for his bosses 80 miles away in Buffalo and hit send. Another low-wage worker rebellion in a season full of them.

A once-in-a-lifetime pandemic a debilitating recession and trillions in government aid had caused something to shift in the world’s largest economy. Hourly wages for fast food workers rose nearly 14 percent last year the fastest growth on record. All over America people were quitting jobs at record rates. Even in a place such as Bradford with its shrinking population and 30 percent poverty rate low-wage service workers sensed that they finally had a little power.

Soon after Dustin sent the petition the phone was ringing and the regional supervisor in Buffalo was demanding to know who was behind it. Dustin’s first instinct was to panic and plead ignorance. An hour later he called and confessed.

“I was trying to get better pay for my people” Dustin said.

Dustin Snyder 21 now the former assistant general manager at McDonald's and his co-workers staged a walkout and quit their jobs. He helped them find better paying jobs; now he rises early in the morning to pick some up and drive them to work at a lumber mill.

“There are better ways to go about this” the regional supervisor replied. She had been thinking about boosting pay at the Bradford McDonald’s she said but she was not going to give into threats or give up control. Because of the petition no one was getting a raise. If the workers did not like it they could quit.

Days earlier Dustin had accepted a job at a lumber mill that paid $11.50-an-hour or 60 cents more than he made as assistant general manager. But he did not really want to quit McDonald’s. He liked his co-workers who had become some of his closest friends and he liked being a leader. He just wanted some affirmation and a little more money both for himself and his team.

Dustin asked his employees to gather around him in the kitchen. Egg McMuffins sat half made on the counter. A clock on the cash register that tracked the restaurant’s drive-through times and transmitted the data back to corporate ticked away the seconds since their last completed order.

“Why would you want to work for a company that doesn’t value you?” Dustin asked. He turned to one of the restaurant’s longest serving employees. “You’ve been here for five years” he said. “What have you got for it? Nothing.”

The workers clad in their black uniforms ball caps and nonslip shoes stared at him unsure what they were supposed to do next. Dustin explained that he was leaving and locking up the restaurant. If they followed he promised he would help them all find better jobs. “How many of you want to go with me?” Dustin asked.

Initially there was silence. Then seven of the nine raised their hands. Two who decided not to join took seats at a table in the empty restaurant. The rest tossed aside their headsets and abandoned their posts at the drive-through and registers. Instead of racing to serve customers they began making food for themselves: a Quarter Pounder a large fries an iced caramel coffee with whipped cream and extra pumps of caramel.

Dustin’s anxiety which had been building since he sent the fax began to ebb. His co-workers were ebullient. “It’s a walkout” one yelled as they headed out into an economy where low-wage workers long-accustomed to feeling scorned ignored and invisible were realizing they suddenly had some agency.

We’re done

In the restaurant’s windowless back office Dustin was calling Stephanie Kelley the Bradford McDonald’s general manager to tell her what was happening.

“What if no one goes with you?” she asked.

“Everyone already said they were” Dustin replied.

Stephanie 36 had recently accepted a job at a bank in town and like Dustin was finishing out her final two weeks. She’d spent nearly a decade at the Bradford McDonald’s working her way up from the bottom to the restaurant’s top job. To join the protest was to throw away a reputation for hard work she had fought to build. To stay home was to abandon her employees.

“It won’t look good to get fired from McDonald’s” she told Dustin on the phone.

“I’ve already made up my mind” Dustin replied.

The discontent driving the Bradford workers and so many others had been there for years an ever-present aspect of an economy that could be especially cruel to anyone without an education. The pandemic — the fights with customers over masks and the fears of falling sick — added to the strain. But it was the labor shortages which extended to just about every part of the country that caused workers’ long-suppressed anger to burst into the open.

Unlike the strikes of an earlier era most of the walkouts included no picket lines. Rarely did the workers even make demands. “WE ALL QUIT SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE” read the message last June on a Burger King marquee in Lincoln Neb. where according to the workers the air conditioner had been broken for weeks and the temperatures in the kitchen soared past 90 degrees.

Sometimes workers left behind notes for bosses and customers that resembled parting primal screams: “We will not work for a company that DOES NOT care!!!” employees at a Del Taco in Circleville Ohio wrote.

“The staff at this location has walked out because we were being treated poorly overworked and underpaid” read a message from the employees of a Biggby Coffee in Toledo. Often the dashed-off notes became hits on social media passed along by equally fed-up workers. Sometimes they would show up in a short segment on the local television news before fading away.

Definitive numbers on these small-scale walkouts do not exist. The Bureau of Labor Statistics only tracks major stoppages that involve more than 1000 workers. But Mike Elk a labor reporter and founder of paydayreport.com has compiled a database of 1600 walkouts since March 2020 that included as many as 100000 workers.

Stephanie was now deciding whether she wanted to be one of them. Like her staff she had come to feel “degraded” and “belittled” by her bosses and some of the customers. The franchise owner had set the Bradford McDonald’s starting wage at $9.25 an hour while new workers at his McDonald’s less than 20 miles away in Olean N.Y. where the minimum wage was higher were earning $15 an hour. The low pay had made it almost impossible for Stephanie and Dustin to retain workers and keep the restaurant running.

Stephanie’s call with Dustin lasted only about a minute. She decided she could not let Dustin and their day-shift crew “do it alone.” She hung up and texted the night shift staff. “I want you all to know that everyone on the day shift just walked out and quit” she wrote. She said she was joining the walkout — “Effective 10:51 a.m. I no longer work at McDonald’s” — and encouraged the rest of the staff to quit too.

“I believe that you all are worth more than anything they’re giving you” she continued. “I am proud of all of you. Every single one of you. Whether you quit or not I am proud of you.”

Then she drove to the McDonald’s where she saw cars backing up in the drive-through. Most of the workers were gathered in the parking lot laughing and smiling. The worker who had been with the restaurant for five years was sobbing. She had been swept up in the initial excitement of the walkout but was now worried about finding a new job and paying her rent. She was terrified of losing her subsidized apartment.

“We will help you get a job that pays better” Dustin reassured her. He and Stephanie were going to drive everyone to the Burger King two miles away where Stephanie knew the general manager and the pay started at $10 an hour.

Before Dustin locked the doors he realized there was one last thing he wanted to do for his McDonald’s customers. He could not find a pen so he snatched a blue highlighter from the back office. “Due to lack of pay we all quit” he scribbled.

In the parking lot a half-dozen employees were waiting on him for rides to Burger King. The line of cars full of hungry and angry customers now wrapped around the building.

“Hey! We just want a Quarter Pounder and fries” a man called out to Dustin from his car.

“Well we just want to be paid more and treated better” Dustin replied.

‘Tough times’

Dustin and his co-workers had come to feel that no one understood what their jobs and lives were really like. The biggest frustration was the pay which had been $8.25 an hour until the franchise owner boosted it by $1 a few months into the pandemic.

“We understand these are tough times” Enrico Francani the owner wrote in a letter to the staff explaining the increase.

“How can you say you understand tough times when you’re only paying people $9.25 an hour?” Dustin recalled thinking.

The restaurant continued to lose long-serving shift managers throughout 2021 to entry-level jobs at Walmart ($13.75 an hour) and Tim Hortons ($12 an hour). The departures hit the Bradford McDonald’s especially hard at the beginning of the month when disability checks arrived and customers had money to burn on burgers and fries.

“Can anyone go into work right now? They’re down 6 shifts and drowning” Stephanie wrote on the employee group chat on Sept. 1 four days before the walkout.

A few minutes passed with no response.

“Anyone??” she asked again.

The only thing that seemed to matter to the corporate office were the numbers: revenue drive-through times and the weekly tally of complaints. Once Dustin worked 30 hours straight to prepare the restaurant for a health inspection. It passed but the criticism from the bosses about the restaurant’s cleanliness and his inability to retain employees continued unabated. Heavy turnover led to more mistakes and longer wait times for customers who took their frustration out on workers who already felt stigmatized by their fast-food jobs.

“The hate is towards the wrong people” said Caitlin Cox a shift manager newly pregnant with her second child. “It’s ridiculous.” She was certain that customers who regularly belittled the staff for enforcing mask mandates or botching orders would judge her harshly for having a baby while “flipping burgers.” And she had come to dread the thought of working at McDonald’s while she was visibly pregnant.

In Bradford once home to entrepreneurs and wealthy oil barons the population is shrinking. Buildings in the downtown area are mostly empty.

The owner ferried by his driver typically visited the Bradford location just once a year employees said and not even that often once the pandemic hit. Dustin believed that Francani was relying on his Pennsylvania restaurants — with their low salaries — to offset higher costs in New York where he had to pay his McDonald’s workers $15 an hour.

Francani did not respond to a list of detailed questions regarding his Bradford location. In a statement he said that he had initiated a series of “listening sessions” with workers and was adding paid sick leave and raising starting wages in Bradford. “We’re very grateful for the outstanding efforts of the McDonald’s Bradford team” he wrote.

McDonald’s USA issued a statement in which it said it was “disappointed” by the poor treatment that employees had endured at the Bradford restaurant: “The allegations shared in this reporting are deeply troubling and have no place in a McDonald’s-branded restaurant. Quite simply they are unacceptable.”

Dustin understood that Francani was entitled to pay his Bradford workers about 40 percent less than his nearby New York employees. “It’s a good idea but you’re hurting people” he said. “At what price is it enough? At what point is it just not worth it? What’s the cost of another human being to you?”

‘A high school job’

These were some of the questions that people in Bradford were fighting about in the immediate aftermath of the walkout. Less than an hour had passed before someone snapped a picture of Dustin’s sign on the drive-through speaker and posted it in a Facebook group called “B----ing Bout Bradford.”

Most of those weighing in on the McDonald’s walkout were service workers: certified nursing assistants waitresses security guards and store cashiers who were barely scraping by themselves. Theirs were the voices of a place whose best days seem behind it. On Bradford’s mostly empty Main Street Art Deco Italianate and Neo-Classical buildings loom as a reminder of an earlier era when the city was home to wealthy oil barons and hungry entrepreneurs. The Zippo factory opened in 1932 still ships its iconic windproof lighters all over the world. But the region has been bleeding manufacturing jobs and people for years.

“Do you have the next great idea?” asked signs from the Bradford Area Alliance offering a $20000 prize to help seed a local start-up. Set amid abandoned storefronts the question came off as a plea.

Some speaking out on “B----ing Bout Bradford” blasted the work stoppage as an act of entitlement — another sign of America’s moral decay and waning work ethic. “You got what you deserve when your paycheck came in” wrote a 41-year-old father of two young boys. “Probably didn’t deserve that because it sounds like you were just there putting in time with bad attitudes instead of working to make your situation better.”

Other commenters called fast food “a high school job” whose long hours and low pay were supposed to spur young workers to strive for more. Dustin and his crew they said should “go back to school” “quit making excuses” get a second job or move to a city with higher wages and more opportunity. Or they complained about the service at the McDonald’s (“I’ve never one f---ing time got my order right! Not once!”) and derided the penmanship on Dustin’s hastily scribbled sign. (“Maybe they should be home practicing their handwriting skills.”) The McDonald’s workers’ demands to be seen and heard had broken some unspoken rule; their anger seemed to threaten Bradford’s social order.

Others countered that big companies such as McDonald’s had a moral obligation to pay their employees enough to survive. “We have families and bills and can’t even get through with the pay we get” wrote a cashier at the Bradford Dollar Tree. And they called for a higher minimum wage to match the $15 an hour that workers were making in New York.

Just like the critics the walkout’s defenders cast the protest as a symptom of a much larger societal disease made worse by the labor shortage and the long pandemic.

“People in the service industry are done with the disrespect” wrote a local physician. “I don’t think it’s just about the money. … Whether it’s about flipping burgers or saving lives they crave gratitude and validation. Society has become so intolerant. So disrespectful. So judgmental. So cruel. Let’s change it.”

Soon some of the McDonald’s workers were weighing in to explain themselves and defend their colleagues. “You have NO RIGHT to talk down on those workers when they take a stand and have had enough” wrote John Lockwood who had worked at the restaurant for 20 years and had quit earlier that morning. “If you don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes keep your f---ing mouth shut.”

‘The McRejects’

Of the Bradford McDonald’s workers who remained after the waves of spring and summer attrition five had intellectual or physical disabilities that made it hard for them to find work at a better pay Dustin said. Two were 17-year-old girls who had quit school and were homeless. In the immediate aftermath of the walkout one of those teenage girls Shakira Griffin was waiting in the McDonald’s parking lot for Dustin to give her a ride to Burger King where she planned to fill out an application.

She phoned her boyfriend and her mother. Neither answered. A few hours later she texted both to let them know about the walkout. “Steph and Dustin is helping us get jobs” she wrote.

Shakira had started at McDonald’s in March after her mother lost custody of her and her father and his new girlfriend had kicked her out of their house. Before she dropped out of high school in the spring her teachers had tried to look out for her as best they could. Her favorite a special-education teacher had slipped her $25 to buy some bras and on her birthday gave her a dark green American Eagle hoodie that hung loosely on her skinny frame.

“I could tell you that it wasn’t cheap!” said Shakira of the sweatshirt that she wore everywhere.

Like so many of her colleagues Shakira had grown accustomed to being told she was not good enough: by teachers fellow students and even her parents. Now she was jubilant. “I was doing stuff with people besides arguing” she said of the walkout. “I was standing up for myself and what I deserve. I’ve never done that before.”

Griffin and Gray take a walk in the woods.

By nightfall a crew of $15-an-hour McDonald’s workers had arrived from New York and reopened the drive-through though the rest of the restaurant remained closed. The Bradford workers were still buzzing with excitement.

“Let’s all stand outside the mcdonalds and riot. Hahaha” one crew member wrote on their chat.

“I love all you guys. You are amazing” another added.

“We’ll be friends forever” wrote Matthew Arndt who was developmentally delayed and autistic. “Remember my door. My heart is open.”

Six years earlier Matt had taken a Greyhound bus to Bradford from Tacoma Wash. to visit a woman he met while playing a video game called “Second Life.” The woman turned out to be married. Now Matt 32 lived with her her husband and another developmentally delayed woman in a rotting brown and yellow two-story rental which had no working furnace black mold and bedbugs. Matt was the only one in the house with a job and they had all come to depend on his salary to survive.

He had not been back to see his father or siblings since arriving in Bradford. His job at McDonald’s was his refuge. His co-workers had become his family. Sometimes he and the rest of the night shift crew would finish work around 2 a.m. and walk two miles to the Sheetz coffee shop where they would talk and eat mozzarella sticks boneless chicken bites and burritos until dawn.

Matt texted his colleagues that the regional supervisor had called him and was trying to entice him to stay but that he was not going to betray his friends.

“She’s desperate now” he wrote.

“Yeah” agreed Shakira who also had received a call. “She really is desperate.”

The workers continued texting for several more hours. They complained about the people in town who were deriding them for walking out.

“People think fast food workers are lazy” one former crew member wrote. “All they want is their muffins and nuggets.”

“Yeah we ain’t people” another replied.

They traded gossip about which workers might be staying. Several noted hopefully that the drive-through line at Burger King seemed longer than usual and that maybe the shutdown had scared some McDonald’s customers away.

Someone suggested they rename their McDonald’s group chat. Matt came up with the idea that they immediately and unanimously decided to adopt: “The McRejects.”

‘A slap in the face’

Dustin rose at 4 a.m. and headed out the door to his car still clad in his camouflage pajama pants and a hoodie. A month had passed since the walkout. It was his day off but he had promised two of his former McDonald’s crew members who he had helped land jobs with him at the lumber mill that he would drive them to work every day. Neither had cars.

“Jesus it’s cold out this morning” Dustin’s first pickup of the morning said as he slid into the passenger seat. “I left my window open last night and just about froze my balls off.”

“Yesterday was colder” Dustin replied as he steered through Bradford’s empty streets. The “check engine” light on his dashboard glowed.

Most of the McRejects found new jobs for higher pay at Burger King Dunkin’ and the Save-A-Lot grocery store. Shakira landed a $10 an hour position stocking shelves at a Crosby’s convenience store and was living with her boyfriend’s family. Matt and his best friend from McDonald’s David Putnam were making $12 an hour at Tim Hortons doughnut shop. The extra money meant David who was raising his 2-year-old son on his own no longer needed donated food from the “Blessing Box” near his house. He had recently even been able to treat his mother and stepfather to dinner at the Hunan Buffet across the parking lot from his new job.

Matt’s finances were still tight. One of his housemates had recently been kicked off disability and he was using his extra pay to help cover her portion of the rent.

After just three weeks at the lumber mill Dustin got a $1 raise to $12.50-an-hour part of a companywide pay hike. He hoped the money would help him finally afford his own place. For the moment he was paying his mom who was on disability and his stepdad who did not work about $850 a month to live in his childhood bedroom. The money helped to cover their rent and the food stamps they lost due to Dustin’s income.

By this point in his life Dustin had hoped to have moved out of his childhood bedroom. Shortly after high school he left Bradford in search of a better life in Maine where he had helped a family from his church start a new congregation. He had considered going to college to become a pastor. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life and it felt meaningful” he said. But he did not have the money for school and fell out with his church. Lately he said he felt as if he was “just kind of floating.”

On this day floating meant grabbing a few hours of sleep playing video games and then heading back to the mill around 4 p.m. to take his friends home. They tossed their helmets and lunch pails in his car’s trunk. The smell of sawdust clung to their clothes and filled Dustin’s car. One of his friends was complaining about the job which required them to stand in one spot for 10 hours a day lifting and stacking wooden boards.

“Ugh the repetition” he said. “It just repeats and repeats and repeats.”

“You gotta look at it a different way” Dustin countered. “It stinks because it is the same thing every day. Yeah it’s boring. But it’s a good paycheck and they treat you with respect and like a human being.”

Former McDonald's employees Dustin Snyder left and RJ Schmidt 19 head home after work.

Most of the workers in Dustin’s section had been at the mill for only a couple of months and Dustin attributed the heavy turnover to the tedious nature of the job. He tried to fight off the boredom as best he could by asking questions about the different kinds of wood they processed and how the different machines worked. He chatted up the fork lift driver who had been at the mill for almost three decades and was making $30 an hour. If he could just make it to three months Dustin knew he would qualify for a $300 bonus a 401(k) and health insurance — something he had been without for more than three years.

“It’s super easy” he said of the lifting and stacking. “You barely move.” The downside was the monotony which was numbing in a way that McDonald’s had never been.

Weeks passed and Dustin found it hard to stop thinking about his old job. He missed the friendships he’d built at the restaurant. He missed the challenge and satisfaction that came with helping his intellectually disabled workers master a task. He missed being a leader.

When Dustin ran into one of the McDonald’s Sunday regulars who gathered at a back table to gossip and complain about their shrinking pensions he quizzed him about service at the restaurant. The man grumbled about the rising price of coffee and the “haughty” new staff at the restaurant.

“We didn’t get paid enough” Dustin replied “but we tried to treat you well.”

Whenever Dustin passed the McDonald’s he would take note of the number of cars lined up at the drive-through. “I think they’re losing customers” he would often say.

About six weeks after the walkout Dustin noticed that the owner had changed the sign on the restaurant’s marquee. “Hiring starting at $10” it now read.

The 75-cent raise was all that he and his staff had really wanted and all that they had been fighting for. But to Dustin it still felt like a “slap in the face.” His former bosses seemed to be sending him a message that their fight was never really about pay. It was about status and power and proving to Dustin and the others that despite their modest gains and whatever changes might be taking place in the U.S. economy they were still replaceable.

Dustin did not regret the walkout. He had “refused to bow down to the big scary corporation” he said. He had rallied his friends and helped them find similar work at higher pay. Dustin’s lumber mill job would do for now. Maybe the meaning he had been searching for would come later.

Instead she can be paid every day.

She uses a service called DailyPay to get money for hours she's already worked before payday. ""It's very convenient — especially if you have an emergency come up and you need money right then and there"" she said.

Gallegos uses DailyPay a couple times a week but she added that she sometimes takes out too much money and finds herself in a hole later on. And she doesn't love that she has to pay a small fee. Still she's glad it's an option.

DailyPay is one of many paycheck-advance apps that have popped up in recent years that give workers early access to their earned wages. Some like Earnin are available for anyone to use. Others including DailyPay and others such as Branch Even and Payactiv are offered to workers through their employers.

At a time when many companies are struggling to find workers amid the pandemic-induced labor shortage some employers are looking at offering these services as an added perk to help recruit and retain workers.

Proponents of these services note that they offer workers who live paycheck to paycheck much better alternatives to payday loans cash advances late payment charges and overdraft fees.

Consumer advocates warn that the services should be used carefully especially since some of them charge small fees for the early transfers.

The Twin Cities area which has been a financial services hub for decades has seen some of these firms set up operations here.

In 2019 New York-based DailyPay opened a second office in downtown Minneapolis which has quickly grown to 150 employees and now houses its customer support center and payments processing. After raising another $175 million in a Series D round of funding in May when it was valued at more than $1 billion DailyPay is now planning to add another 50 workers in the Twin Cities by the end of the year.

Meanwhile Branch a Minneapolis-based fintech firm that pivoted from helping employees swap shifts to accelerating payments to workers is planning to double its headcount to 200 by next year. Branch also recently secured $48 million from private investors and a $500 million line of credit in a Series B round of funding.

Jason Lee CEO of DailyPay says that such services are growing in popularity as people have become accustomed to being able to move money when they want such as paying a friend a couple bucks through Venmo when going out for a slice of pizza.

""All of us as consumers have been habituated toward money moving instantly and money being controlled in the palm of our hand"" he said. ""What we want to do is create a world where minute to minute hour to hour day by day you can control all aspects of your pay in the same way you can control all aspects of your checking account.""

Last year DailyPay signed up one of its largest employers for the service: Minneapolis-based Target which employs nearly 400000 workers across the U.S. It also works with other large companies such as Dollar Tree and Big Lots.

DailyPay charges workers $2.99 for an instant transfer. For a next-day transfer it's $1.99 or free depending on the contract. Company executives note that is cheaper than some out-of-network ATMs.

""It may not sound like much"" said Ted Rossman senior industry analyst for CreditCards.com but the fees can add up and take away from money you could be saving. ""It can be a slippery slope.""

While it's not technically a loan Rossman said that a $3 fee to take out $100 over two weeks is the equivalent of a 78% annual percentage rate.

But he said he understands why some workers may want to use these services in a pinch. ""There are not a lot of great alternatives which is why I think we're seeing these kinds of things spring up"" he said.

Branch which works with companies such as Kelly Services doesn't necessarily charge a fee for accessing wages in advance but it does for instant transfers to an external debit card.

The goal Branch CEO Atif Siddiqi said is that consumers won't have to use paycheck advances regularly and that they build a cash cushion.

In financial services such businesses are known as the earned wage access industry — and they are largely unregulated.

Some consumer advocates want the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to rescind its decision last year to not consider such services as credit providers exempting them from certain consumer protection laws.

In the meantime employers say these paycheck advance apps have become quite popular with their workers.

Since it began offering DailyPay last spring about 100 of Mary T's 900 workers use it in any given week said Jason Tjosvold chief administrative officer for the Coon Rapids-based provider of home and health care services.

Mary T previously offered loans to employees who needed emergency funds but some workers found that process cumbersome and didn't like how long it took.

""It's challenging for people to reconcile how they can get a ride or order a meal and get it within a half hour"" said Tjosvold. ""But if you work on the first Sunday of our pay period you don't get paid until 20 days afterwards so [that is] essentially three weeks.""

Mary T is in an industry that is always struggling to fill positions a challenge made worse by the pandemic. So adding DailyPay as an option has also been an additional recruiting tool in addition to other things it's done such as referral bonuses increasing its 401(k) match and providing more vacation time.

Mall of America which pays its 600 or so employees twice a month like most employers started offering DailyPay in 2019.

""Employees want choices and the ability to access their pay when they want"" said Carrie Wright the mall's vice president of human resources.

About half of the mall's staff has enrolled in DailyPay meaning they've logged in and created an account. And about a quarter of them are considered engaged users making an average of 2.5 transfers a week with the typical amount being $100 according to the mall.

Still not everyone is rushing to use these apps. Zetta Sharkey a custodian at the mall isn't interested in getting part of her paycheck early.

""I'm old school"" she said adding that she prefers to get paid every two weeks.

That way she doesn't get tempted to spend it right away which she added could happen a lot since she works at a mall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vNDJmcmVld2F5LmNvbS9uZXdzL29zdGVyaWEtNTQ1LWl0YWxpYW4ta2l0Y2hlbi1iYXItY29taW5nLXRvLXBhdWxzYm9yby10YXJnZXRpbmctZGVjZW1iZXItb3BlbmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Osteria 545 Italian Kitchen & Bar Coming to Paulsboro Targeting December Opening,"Reading Time: 10 minutes

Plus there are more really interesting ties back to the 42Freeway area including a long time Washington Township resident and the Principal of Williamstown High School who worked for 5 years as a server at Nino’s!

The storyline reads like a Hollywood Movie script.. so read on to see how this all connects!

Be sure to like their Facebook page to get the latest information on their opening!

The location of the restaurant is 545 W Broad Street in the area of the old Paulsboro Shopping Center which is going through an awesome transformation with a new Save-A-Lot and Dollar Tree store already opened. The restaurant is located in a separate smaller building directly to the left of Save-A-Lot and closest to Billingsport Road.

They owners are targeting a December 2021 opening. Just last week they crossed a milestone when the State officially authorized the liquor license to the three partners!

Keep scrolling this is a long one! And Kevin Smith…what does he have to do with this story?!

Osteria 545 – New Experiences but Nino’s is a Part of Everything

We first learned of the new restaurant after seeing a notice that the Paulsboro liquor license was changing ownership and one of the owners lived right in Washington Township!

In researching further while at the time we didn’t find a Facebook page (they have one now) we found a friend of the family had posted a photo of the building with a banner announcing that Osteria 545 was coming… so we knew we had to get in touch soon.

So the prior Saturday I stopped down to Paulsboro and first caught up with Rich Shaget from Washington Township who gave us a tour of what’s in store for the famed restaurant location… and how they are keeping the best of what Nino’s offered but also making it an all new experience.

The script for success from the three owners is set like a Marvel Avengers movie with each partner bringing together their own special Superhero traits.

The Businessman. The Operations Expert. The Culinary Genius.

A Beautiful Saturday

It was a beautiful end of October Saturday when Mark from 42Freeway stopped down into Paulsboro again… for the first time in a long time. I knew about the new Dollar Tree and Save-A-lot opening in the Paulsboro Plaza but I had just not gotten down this way to post about them so I was eager to see the whole place.

Driving through the shopping center I see the small building to the left and the banner placed overhead announcing the new restaurant coming soon “Osteria 545”

And through the window I see a man on a ladder putting a fresh coat of paint on the walls of the main bar area… One of three partners in Osteria 545… Rich Shaget.

Rich is a very friendly guy who can’t hold back the excitement he has for the restaurant! You instantly realize that Rich is going to be very comfortable chatting with customers in the restaurant making sure everything is to their liking and keeping everything running smoothly.

Rich explains he brings a key business mindset to the restaurant “The Numbers Guy”. Being successful in the Corporate world managing people and budgets it makes a lot of sense.

In our long conversation we chatted about how the challenges of running a successful restaurant today has greatly increased with the rising cost of food products and staffing concerns.

I had mentioned that in the reality shows featuring problematic restaurants they almost always have a story line revolving around managing costs. Rich says that is a key goal of his to keep tabs on costs identifying profitable items and those that aren’t.

Rich and I both agreed that Paulsboro needed another restaurant offering what Nino’s did. A gathering place for the town and others serving delicious food wine and cold beer… a place for a family dinner with Grandmom at the table or just a quiet experience at the bar.

Nino’s Legacy: A Step Back

For the longest part of my visit it was just Rich and I chatting about the legacy of Nino Gervasi’s and what Osteria 545 was bringing to the famed location.

So it was nice to hear from Rich (and then later from Angelo) how much Nino’s meant to the town of Paulsboro… and how excited everyone in the town and local Government was about the reopening of a restaurant there.

An interesting thing for 42Freeway’s Mark is that many years (decades) ago I had business dealings with the Mobil Refinery and Research Complex which is just minutes away.

For several years I effectively had a “Gold Pass” to walk around all of the offices of the massive Mobil complex from all of the refinery the research buildings the labs… and despite being in Paulsboro twice a week stopping at Mobil I never once stopped in at Nino Gervasi’s Italian Restaurant. I know shocking right?

In researching I’ve learned that former owner and Chef Nino traces his 545 W Broad Street roots back to 1996 when the restaurant first surfaced as Matera’s.

On November 3 1996… literally 25 years ago this week the Philadelphia Inquirer had a small piece on Nino’s start at Matera’s. “They hear about Nino’s creations and line up at the door!”

Six years later another article in the Inquirer… this time a restaurant review… listed the restaurant as Nino Gervasi’s.

There are so many excellent quotes in the review…

Inside is some of the best Italian home cooking in the region… there is a reason Nino Gervasi’s has beaten the odds and flourished in Paulsboro why the parking lot is full of cars most nights. Maureen Fitzgerald on Nino Gervasi’s Philadelphia Inquirer Dec 29 2002

Not too long before Covid impacted all of us in 2020 the restaurant changed hands to new ownership… but the reduced operating days and restrictions of 2020 forced those newer owners to close.

And that is where Rich Angelo and Nick step into the picture.

Osteria 545: The Tour and the People

The first thing that you notice when entering the building is the amazing large bar in the left-most room. One of those “Yeah they can’t make this today” types of dark wood bars that just oozes character and stories from it’s woodgrain.

The full restaurant actually occupies four store fronts with three of them visible to the public as dining areas.

So that first left most section is the main entrance and where the bar is located. There are a couple TVs in the room as well as a take-out beer fridge.

The article I found from 1996 has a quote from a local gentleman saying the ornate wooded bar is over 100 years old! I am searching but I can’t find the history yet on the bar or where it came from!

This is how the main bar looked when the new owners (Osteria 545) took over!

Upgrades are in progress but the bar will stay!

When I visited the flooring was ripped up soon to be replaced with a new covering and as I mentioned there is paint going up on the walls.

Rich says the bar is staying in place and they may add some extra shelving in front of the wall length back mirrors to show off the forthcoming liquor offerings.

Rich sees the bar area as the “pre-dinner warmup grab a couple drinks before being seated for dinner type” of area. But with a couple televisions in the right places it’s easy to see this as being a fun but quiet place for locals to hang out and catch up on the news or the big game on the televisions.

And how the restaurant is built out as sections works for them in this regard… as the bar is separated by a partition wall but offers a wide entrance up front to enter the dining area.

The second room is expected to be the main dining room. Along the back wall a new partition wall is in place to separate the kitchen entrance and waitstaff traffic from the diners. This was an suggestion from partner Angelo.

The third section is also used for dining but because it is configured as it’s own segment so it also is expected to be used for private functions.

During my tour Rich also took me through the back kitchen area which is also being updated and reconfigured to best suit the needs of what is expected to be a very busy restaurant. The layout of the kitchen area… as well as the menu… all under the auspices of chef Nick.

Osteria 545 Paulsboro

Angelo: High School Principal and Former Nino’s Server

After getting the full tour of the restaurant the history and concept for Osteria 545… Angelo popped in to the restaurant after a visit to pick up supplies locally.

Angelo’s career and passion is being the Principal at Williamstown High School. A 2019 article in The Sun Newspapers is headlined “I Love Kids”

So let’s be very clear… the day-to-day business operations of Osteria 545 will be Rich and the kitchen and menu will be Nick.

But there is a very important reason for Angelo being in the picture lending expertise…

As a younger man and at the start of his teaching career Angelo was a server at Nino Gervasi’s restaurant!

He tells the story of his first time working at the restaurant… he reluctantly agreed to fill in for a night not expecting big things from the experience.

But the restaurant then was packed! The people kept coming in! Customers were happy! The food was delicous.

And he made money… more than he expected from his very part-time server experiment.

Well that experiment turned into five years!

And during that time Angelo paid attention to what worked in Nino’s and what needed improvement.

That new partition wall to separate the diners from the kitchen? Angelo’s idea.

His experience was that the noise from a busy kitchen as well as servers moving fast through that area… could take away from quiet dining experience.

But then Angelo was very quick to mention “The kitchen is Nick’s. We’re positioning Nick to focus on what he does best… be an awesome chef”

And what makes Angelo’s philosophy even more interesting is… when I got home and starting researching additional aspects of the story I found this quote of Angelo’s in the Sun Newspaper.

“My job as a leader is to remove obstacles and let the smart people I’m working with flourish” he added. Angelo DeStefano on making his education team successful.

Wow that fits exactly into how he described his role in Osteria 545!

One last comment on Angelo… well I haven’t fully connected the dots on what brought these three partners together to a degree Angelo is the center of the partnership.

Chef Nick is the son of Nino and worked at the restaurant Angelo was a server in the restaurant and became friends with Nick and Rich and Angelo are cousins. It all fits.

Chef Nick Tomasetto

The third partner in Osteria 545 is Nick Tomasetto who should be known to many in the 42Freeway area… or at least from his restaurants and delicious food!

Well as mentioned earlier Nick is the son of Nino and growing up around the restaurant Nick took on a variety of roles. Nick started out washing dishes proved that he was capable to grow within the business…and then learned the delicious techniques of Nino’s cooking eventually becoming the head chef at Nino’s!

Years later Nick started his own restaurants right in the core 42Freeway area… Washington Township’s Arugula and in Deptford La Polpetta.

Both restaurants gained a quick following with a lot of local buzz… all driven by the delicious food that Nick and his staff would prepare.

During my visit Nick was not on site but both Rich and Angelo had a ton of positive things to say about Nick and his culinary skills… which is shown by their complete trust in how the kitchen and menu were being developed by Nick!

We can’t wait to meet Nick and try his delicious menu at Osteria 545!

Kevin Smith?

Kevin Smith is a director and actor famous for movies such as; The Clerks Jay and Silent Bob Mallrats Chasing Amy and more!

And in 2004 he release Jersey Girl starring Jennifer Lopez Ben Affleck George Carlin Liv Tyler and more!

Kevin is a New Jersey guy and well… the movie is called Jersey girl… so when Kevin was looking for filming locations he chose South Jersey for principle shooting and Paulsboro was the center of it all!

Kevin was so appreciative of Paulsboro during his filming held a local premier of the movie at Paulsboro High School!

A 2004 New York Times article called Paulsboro “The Best Movie Performance by a Municipality” as it chronicled the Paulsboro premier.

And how does that connect to the restaurant that will become Osteria 545?

Well that fourth section of the restaurant was set up as storage and offices and hanging on the wall was this poster from the Paulsboro premier… signed by Kevin Smith himself and giving accolades to Nino.

Nino – Many Thanks For the Fun and Grub!

Paulsboro Plaza: A Rebirth

This turned into quite a long post didn’t it? So many stories to tell!

So as I mentioned in the last few years a Save-A-Lot and a Dollar Tree store opened in the shopping center.

A new Dollar Tree joins a newer Save A Lot grocery in Paulsboro.

The shopping center is seeing new life after a couple of decades looking like it was more suited for the wrecking ball than rebirth.

Originally the center was home to an Acme Supermarket an Ames discount store a Thrift Drugs Pharmacy and a variety of smaller locally owned stores.

But in the early to mid 90s the Ames chain closed and then the Acme shuttered the Paulsboro location.

In my years of travel to Paulsboro for my former day job I always remembered it as an abandoned retail center.

A 2017 NJ.com article calls out the first success when former Acme was planned to become Save-A-Lot.

There is still a large part of the center that needs some love.. the former Ames section.

Construction fencing is currently up around the parking area of that former Ames building at it is targeted to be redeveloped also. We’ll have more on that in a subsequent post.

(AP) — Plans for Dominion Energy’s massive offshore wind farm near the Virginia coast are being filed with the State Corporation Commission bringing the project one major step closer to becoming reality the company said Friday.

Dominion plans to erect 176 wind turbines in the Atlantic Ocean about 27 miles (43 kilometers) from the shores of Virginia Beach. The project is expected to generate enough power for about 660000 homes.

Dominion said in a statement that the filing with Virginia’s corporation commission keeps the project on schedule for completion by the end of 2026. Earlier this year the company filed a request for federal approval through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

“Our customers expect reliable affordable and clean energy and we intend to deliver” Dominion Energy President Robert M. Blue said in a statement. “In addition to solar storage and nuclear offshore wind is a key component of our strategy and a game changer for the Hampton Roads economy.”

The Virginia Clean Economy Act sets a target for Dominion Energy to construct or purchase at least 5200 megawatts of energy through offshore wind by 2034 and to achieve 100% carbon-free energy production by 2045.

Two wind turbines stand off the Virginia Coast. They are part of Dominion’s pilot project which is the first for offshore wind in federal waters.

The project reflects plans by President Joe Biden’s administration to develop enough offshore wind energy by 2030 to power 10 million American homes for a year. An estimated 80000 jobs are expected to be created.

State officials have said the offshore wind farm off Virginia’s coast is expected to support about 1100 long-term jobs although there will likely be about 1500 jobs during peak construction.

Last month Gov. Ralph Northam announced that Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy will partner with Dominion on a $200 million factory making turbine blades for offshore wind projects. It’s expected to create 310 jobs.

The factory will be located at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal and will produce turbine blades for the project in Virginia as well as other offshore wind farms around North America.

Over the next 10 years building and operating the offshore wind industry will be worth $109 billion to businesses in its supply chain according to a recent report from the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind.

Dominion’s pilot project off Virginia’s coast is already providing useful information to the industry on anything from safety issues to coordinating with cargo ships heading for the Port of Virginia.

The company has also learned that the winds off the Virginia coast will provide slightly more energy than expected.

The company had initially expected its commercial turbines to generate electricity at full load about 41.5% of the time on average said Joshua Bennett Dominion Energy vice president of offshore wind. But now it’s expecting them to generate electricity at full load about 43% of the time based on the performance of the two pilot turbines.

“So the pilot turbines are exceeding our expectations” he said.

The Army Corps of Engineers office in Charleston currently oversees 37 active mitigation banks where wetlands are being preserved restored or enhanced by landowners for ""credits"" that can be sold to developers needing to mitigate wetland destruction caused by their projects. For example a builder might agree to purchase 100 credits in a mitigation bank to offset several acres of wetlands damage at a nearby construction site in order to get a permit to build.

As more building takes place and more wetlands are destroyed the need to bank them elsewhere has grown. In addition to those already operating more than three dozen potential mitigation banks are awaiting Army Corps approval. There have been 11 mitigation bank proposals submitted to the federal agency so far this year matching previous annual highs set in 2017 and 2018.

""Since 2017 we've seen a marked increase in the number of submissions"" said David Wilson a mitigation specialist with the Army Corps. ""Before that we were seeing an average of two or three proposals a year. It coincides with the number of projects and number of (construction) permits we're issuing. As the economy is growing we're starting to see mitigation banks grow in anticipation of that need for credits.""

The concept of wetlands banking began in the 1980s but South Carolina didn't get its first bank proposal until 1994. The program is seen as a way to achieve the federal government's policy of no net loss of wetlands which are ecologically important for erosion control water quality and as a wildlife habitat.

""Wetlands benefit all of us"" said Laura Cantral executive director of the Coastal Conservation League. ""They soak up floodwaters provide a home for wildlife and form the sense of place that makes the Lowcountry so special.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L3N0ZXZlbi1hbGtlci13aW5zLTIwMjEtdGltYmVyLXRlY2gtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXBnYS10b3VyLWNoYW1waW9uc9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L3N0ZXZlbi1hbGtlci13aW5zLTIwMjEtdGltYmVyLXRlY2gtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXBnYS10b3VyLWNoYW1waW9ucy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steven Alker wins TimberTech Championship continues outlandish start to senior career,“I guess it's just been building” said Alker who made his senior debut after Monday qualifying at the Boeing Classic in mid-August and ran off six straight top-10 finishes to repeatedly earn a start in the succeeding event. “I've been having chances and … you have a bunch of top-10s and you get in the thick of it and just try to get a W.

Dominoes.

Smart constantly preaches the importance of having a positive impact. The idea is that if a player does the right things his attitude will have a domino effect carrying over to each of his teammates.

“Each and every person in this program is a domino” Clemson transfer Olivier-Maxence Prosper said as he discussed Smart’s message. “You’re either a positive domino which means you’re doing your best to help this team win. Or you’re a negative domino which means you’re bringing the team down. We’re trying to eliminate the negative dominoes and have everybody be a positive domino.”

Smart was one of the nation’s hottest coaches after reaching the Final Four with VCU in 2011 and sending the Rams back to the NCAA Tournament each of the next four seasons. He left for Texas in 2015 but never got the Longhorns beyond the NCAA Tournament’s round of 64.

Now Smart a native of Madison Wisconsin is back in his home state eager to help Marquette return to Big East contention.

Marquette is trying to regain the momentum it established while making eight straight NCAA Tournament appearances from 2006-13 including one regional final and two other Sweet 16 berths.

Smart knew enough about Marquette’s program to understand what’s worked here in the past.

“One thing that’s certainly been true here on the better teams is a level of blue-collar mentality a toughness a group of guys that just wasn’t going to back down from any challenge” Smart said. “So that’s certainly what we’re trying to build.”

Marquette will have a different look from the squad that went 13-14 last year under Steve Wojciechowski who was fired after going 128-95 with no NCAA Tournament victories in seven seasons.

Justin Lewis (7.8 points per game last season) Greg Elliott (6.2) and Oso Ighodaro (1.2) are the only players back who lettered last season. Elliot will serve a four-game suspension to start the season including Tuesday’s opener against Southern Illinois-Edwardsville.

A handful of players transferred with Dawson Garcia heading to North Carolina and Theo John going to Duke. D.J. Carton began his pro career.

Smart restocked his roster by bringing in four transfers and five freshmen. Three of the freshmen signed to play for him at Texas and then followed him to Marquette. Two others signed with Marquette before Wojciechowski was fired.

The most notable transfer is former Maryland guard Darryl Morsell the Big Ten’s defensive player of the year last season.

Morsell said he had just entered the transfer portal when he got a call from Smart. Morsell then reached out to Matt Coleman a friend who had played for Smart at Texas.

“He told me this guy will tell you the truth (that) he ain’t going to lie to you but he’s going to be hard on you” Morsell recalled.

That’s just what Morsell wanted to hear.

Smart’s challenge is to get all these players working together. That’s no small task but amid all the new faces players say Smart is helping to make them one cohesive unit.

“He knew the foundation he wanted for this program” said Morsell who is practicing again after recovering from a torn labrum in his right shoulder. “Regardless of if you were new if you were recruited by a different staff he kind of cleared the way and figured out who was about winning. We’re all a bunch of guys who want to win at the end of the day.”

Smart likes the way his players have taken to his message so far. Of course the real test comes once the games start.

“I think our guys have responded really well but we haven’t had a lot of adversity” Smart said. “The next step is being able to respond well when there’s adversity.”

That adversity could come in a hurry.

Marquette’s schedule includes early tests against No. 11 Illinois and No. 2 UCLA. A preseason poll of the Big East’s coaches had Marquette finishing ninth out of 11 teams.

“For us in our first year I’m not really caught up in necessarily worrying abut what other people’s expectations are at all” Smart said. “It’s about laying the foundation for who we want to be. Because we believe who we want to be will lead to success.”

Wallpaper can be pricey especially if you’re like artist Russell Loughlan and a gut renovation is eating into your budget. But if graphic stripes are what you’re after Loughlan found a solution: hand-paint them himself. Hand-painting requires some patience—it took four days just to line up the tape correctly—but the result is a well-earned wow factor.

Just ask Loughlan’s neighbor Jessie Cutts who recently painted her powder room in marigold and cream. “With a lot of encouragement from Russell I would do an hour or sometimes even half an hour at a time because that’s the only way I could fit it in” she explained in an Instagram caption. “At times it’s definitely frustrating but also what’s the rush?”

With a combo of a ruler level and old-school string with a coin tied to the end Loughlan began the process of measuring out the 2-inch spaces between each line. (Tip: It’s the standard width of wide painter’s tape.) So many straightedges were needed because his old Georgian walls aren’t even—not one 90-degree angle in sight.

​​If your ceilings (or floors) are equally wonky create a truly straight guideline with a level laser pointed horizontally across the wall you’re working on. Once that baseline is established you can go in with a vertical level (or coin-weighted string) and a ruler to pencil in the stripes from ceiling to baseboard. When you’re ready to apply the tape the pencil marks act as a guide for keeping the lines straight. Take a step back periodically to ensure you’re not getting tunnel vision—what seems perfectly linear close-up could actually be crooked.

After decking out his bedroom and bathroom in different variations of two-tones stripes Loughlan has a few tips to keep everything on track.

Peel Back the Tape

Even the highest quality painter’s tape can result in color bleeding through if you’re not careful. By pulling the tape off a few minutes after you finish the second coat the color won’t get a chance to seep under the edges. But if there are some splotches Loughlan recommends going in with a very small sponge brush or honestly just leaving it alone. “You’re hand-painting for a reason” he says. “The imperfections are part of the charm.”

When in Doubt Size Up

Thinner stripes like a pinstripe show imperfections and wobbly lines more than thicker ones he notes. Little 1-inch lines also create more of a hypnotic visual effect not recommended for tight or dark spaces. If you don’t trust the steadiness of your hands—or just want a little more forgiveness—stick to a 2- or 3-inch width.

Patience Makes Perfect

Unless you’re working around the clock this won’t be a quick project. It took Cutts weeks to complete her 6-foot bathroom all while managing two young kids and a full-time job. However the process is so meditative that it can be addicting.

Whether this new film will continue the Fox storyline/original plans remains to be seen but Reynolds’ Deadpool 2 co-star Zazie Beetz is expecting to make her return as Domino with the actress telling Comic Book that she will “make it happen”.

“I would love to revisit Domino” states Beetz. “I would love to do a Deadpool 3 4 5 7 19. I’ve also wanted to be like ‘Maybe I could just do my own origin story.’ I feel honored to have been able to depict her on screen and to have played with her as her. I love her and so I would be more than happy to revisit her on camera. And I think I will. If Disney doesn’t make it happen I’ll make it happen.”

As yet we have no idea what Reynolds and Marvel are cooking up for Deadpool 3. The original plan was to follow Deadpool 2 by reuniting Deadpool Domino and Cable (played of course by Josh Brolin who has already made a major impact on the MCU as Thanos) for X-Force and assuming Marvel doesn’t just scoop up Deadpool and drop him directly into the MCU Doc Ock-style then it would seem a pretty safe bet that the Merc with a Mouth won’t be the only familiar face to return for his next outing.

Are you excited at the prospect of seeing more of Zazie Beetz’s Domino perhaps even as part of the MCU?

Over the course of the pandemic there have been winners and losers.

While many small businesses have done it tough and have even been forced to close their doors some of the bigger companies have found ways to make more money than ever before.

One of them is fast-food giant Domino's which has been celebrating bumper profits from selling locked down Aussies home-delivered pizza.

It seemed the pizzas were flying out of the oven faster than the company could keep up with as it reported a 29 per cent increase in net profit to $188.2 million for the 12 months ending June. Shareholders lapped up the good news sending the value of the company to an all-time high in September.

However the past week has provided a brutal reality check to the pizza giant.

A trading update from the company's annual general meeting late on Wednesday night went down like a lead balloon with investors sparking a staggering collapse of almost 20 per cent on its share price the following day.

The dismal day of trading meant that the market capitalisation of Domino's Pizza which owns the Domino's Pizza franchise in Australia New Zealand and Japan as well as in parts of western Europe sank by $2.3 billion on Thursday alone.

Billionaire Jack Cowin the chairman of Domino's as well as its biggest shareholder saw his personal holdings implode by $600 million in a matter of hours while chief executive Don Meij's shares are now worth $47m less.

Investors and the market were reportedly spooked after the release of the trading update showed the company recorded negative sales on a one-year basis and a weak performance from its Japanese operations.

In the couple of days of trading since the collapse the share price has struggled to recover and one leading retail expert believes Domino's could be heading for a particularly tough period.

Professor Gary Mortimer an expert in retail marketing and consumer behaviour at QUT Business School told news.com.au we could be seeing a shift in how Aussies are spending their cash now that lockdowns are coming to an end.

He said what we are seeing with Domino's plunging share price in the past week is possibly a ""market correction"" as Aussies spend less on takeaway food and more on other things.

""What we've seen with this particular business certainly domestically has been pretty strong growth across all of 2020 and I think that was related to Covid lockdowns particularly in Melbourne and Sydney"" he said.

""People were locked down and unable to leave their homes and restaurants cafes bistros and bars were not able to open to diners.

""What I think has happened is that Australians have throughout 2020 taken advantage of being able to just get a couple of pizzas to their house.

""So I think Domino's took advantage of the pandemic or the pandemic certainly leveraged their sales based on a convenient delivery of food to your home.""

He said Domino's ran a ""really great campaign"" around contactless delivery that made people feel comfortable to order from them and helped sustain the company through the lockdowns.

However as vaccination rates continue to soar across the nation and Australians become more accustomed to going out for a meal again Mortimer predicts businesses that specialise in takeaway like Domino's will take a hit.

""A natural sales decline will materialise because people will want to go out and have a nice pizza at a restaurant instead of ordering one to the house"" he said.

""I think there is a pent-up demand from people especially in Sydney and Melbourne to now go out and have a meal.""

He predicts that supermarkets will also see weaker profits in the coming months for the same reason.

However Domino's is staying optimistic after a tough week on the markets.

A spokeswoman for the company told news.com.au she wouldn't comment on the share price as it's a ""matter for the market"".

However she said there has been a big expansion in the number of new restaurants in the past three years and that the company was confident its operations in Japan – which was largely blamed for the tumbling stock price – will pick up again.

""Over the past three years we have built a materially stronger business in Japan which serves more customers on more occasions – through changing our menu offering and our store footprint"" she said.

""We have opened more than 300 additional stores and expanded into new regions that were previously inaccessible with half of all stores now owned by franchisees.

""As we emerge from the peak of pandemic conditions to 'living with Covid' we are confident Domino's Japan will continue to deliver for our customers and the wider business.""

The company said sales growth in the latest quarter has been strong but sales have been uneven across regions with operations impacted by lockdowns and changes in customer behaviour. Domino's currently has 3169 stores in the network and plans to more than double that number by next decade.

Meanwhile the company's biggest shareholder and one of Australia's richest men has no plans to sell his 23 million shares which are still worth a whopping $2.69 billion even after last week's price crash.

""I did look at the share price on Thursday it goes up and down but it is paper and the only time it is significant is when you sell"" Cowin told The Australian.

""And I am not a seller so that didn't come into the equation.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdsYXNnb3d0aW1lcy5jby51ay9uZXdzLzE5Njk1NTEzLnRha2Vhd2F5LXJldmlldy1kb21pbm9zLW5vdC1iYWQtbWVhbC1wcmljZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Takeaway review: Dominos was not a bad meal but pricey,"The expansion came 16 years after the US chain first entered the UK market with an outlet in Surrey and there are now more than 1200 branches across the UK and the Republic of Ireland so there’s a good chance there’s one within spitting distance of your door.

After all there are 19 in the Greater Glasgow area alone spanning from Bearsden to Barrhead and Clydebank to Cranhill.

There’s a good reason the chain has been so successful and it’s not just relentless marketing it’s a savvy menu of crowd-pleasing classics as well as shifting specials.

But it doesn’t come cheap so is it worth it when there are so many other options? I mean it’s not like Scotland is shy of pizza shops.

The pizza crunch may still be a chippy mainstay but your local area is just as likely to have an artisan outlet these days or something close to it if that’s more your thing.

For our family’s order of four pizzas and a dessert it came to an eye-watering £61.35 – with offers applied.

In fact making the online order was a meal in itself due to the confusing array of deals on the website.

The money bought us a large ham and mushroom (this was a create-your-own as it doesn’t appear on the menu in its own right) a medium ham and pineapple a medium margarita – what my son calls “normal” pizza – and a vegan Chick-Ain’t with veggies and soya strips plus some gherkin slices thrown on for the absolute novelty of it.

We also took the bait and clicked on their dessert of the moment a portion of chocolate cookies with an unctuous After Eight mint filling.

It’s fair to say we wouldn’t have been able to order the last two of those items from most takeaways though the others are absolute standards.

The meal arrived in good time (who wants late cold pizza?) with the tasty bases and toppings being of good quality if not spectacular.

And you’ve probably already guessed one of the main discoveries which is that gherkin slices do not belong on a pizza regardless of how fun you think that might be. And while the cookies were a nice addition they were smaller than expected and not worth the price.

Not a bad meal at all but pricey."

We’ll kick it off with the Dow Jones forecast for 2022. In doing so we will use the Dow Jones Historical Chart On 100 Years as one of the key charts. Why? Because the 100 year Dow Jones chart successfully confirmed an epic secular breakout in the first week of October 2021. This will have a decisive effect on what stocks will do in 2022 is what we believe. Our Dow Jones forecast for 2022 is bullish we believe 40k could and should be touched in 2022. However we also expect one bearish cycle in 2022. So while 2022 should be a year with bullish price action we also believe there will be some really bearish happenings especially if the US Dollar succeeds in clearing 94.60 points (which is what we expect given the very bullish chart setup).

Dow Jones Forecast 2022 Inspired by the 100 Year Chart

The 100 year Dow Jones chart is the one that has this once in a lifetime type of ‘event’: a secular breakout above 100 year resistance. Absolutely phenomenal.

On the first chart we did indicate what happened when the Dow Jones touched this 100 year trendline back in 1929 and in 2000 (see red arrows): an epic crash started. Arguably in 2020 we got a similar attempt to clear the 100 year trendline but it wasn’t as outspoken as back in 2000. If we include 2020 though we have 3 crashes every time this index touched the same 100 year trendline.

The 100 year trendline on the secular Dow Jones chart was broken to the upside in 2021 and this is the basis for higher prices in stock markets at least that’s how we interpret all this. That’s also why our Dow Jones forecast for 2022 is bullish with a price target of 40000 points.

We are living in special times.

The Dow Jones chart above shows the epic breakout in the green circle.

The problem with the 100 year chart is that is really hard to see what is currently happening in order to understand upside potential (or lack thereof).

That’s why we include the 2 charts in the following section. They help us understand medium term upside potential.

Dow Jones Forecast – Upside Potential in 2022?

The 100 year Dow Jones chart is in uncharted territory! It has cleared 100 year resistance. How on earth is it possible to calculate upside potential based on logic resistance levels?

Here is one attempt: the next chart outlines periods in recent history in which the Dow Jones started a bull run. The areas in red are periods in which a ‘breakout’ took place. Interestingly those breakouts printed mostly approx. 30% rallies.

If recent history is any guide we expect the current ‘breakout’ to move 30% higher. This gives us a target of 39 to 40k points.

Here is another way of looking. The ‘risk off’ periods and how long they lasted. Stated differently how long does a ‘risk on’ period usually last?

The difference with the previous chart is that we focus on the timing axis while on the above chart our focus was on the price axis. The chart is self explanatory: we are one year into a ‘risk on’ period in the bigger scheme of things and those ‘risk on’ periods tend to last longer than one year.

Dow Jones Prediction Bullish even beyond 2022

The next 4 Dow Jones charts feature the 100 year pattern. However we use a different chart format. It is a chart format that allows us to zoom in which is really key in understanding what is currently happening.

This is the 100 year Dow Jones chart. As impressive as the one above.

The lower the timeframe on the same chart the more impressive it gets.

This is the monthly chart on some 25 years. It is really on this timeframe that we start seeing how impressive the breakout is. Let’s repeat this once more: the Dow Jones index cleared a 100 year resistance line and it did so in 2021. How can we not have a bullish Dow Jones forecast for 2022 but even beyond 2022?

Note on the above chart what happened back in 2000 when the Dow Jones was not able to clear its 100 year resistance line. That was pretty ugly to say the least.

This is the weekly chart on 3 years.

As said it gets more impressive the lower we go.

And this is the daily chart featuring the Dow Jones in 2021. Arguably the lows of September and the first days of October marked a backtest of the 100 year rising trendline. It might be that price did not touch the trendline (which is true on this chart) but readers should not forget that these type of charting services are not desiged to make create 100 year charts. We are pretty sure that the recent ‘lows’ were a backtest of the 100 year trendline.

While it is clear that the above charts suggest that THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT because the 100 year resistance line was cleared and did not result in a Wall Street crash like in 1929 we would like to warn readers that is an exception. Don’t think in terms of THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT the majority of times this saying is not valid. It is highly exceptional to see such an epic breakout on a chart.

Even the Global Dow the index for global stock markets is in breakout territory.

Is the epic breakout in the Dow Jones good or bad news?

Investors would consider this Dow Jones forecast for 2022 as ‘good news’. However there is a case to be made that this is not good news. Why?

The alternative viewpoint is that this epic breakout in the Dow Jones suggests that inflation is underway maybe even hyperinflation. If we go back to the 70ies we can see that inflation picks up slowly but accelerates at a certain point. Back then it was gold signaling elevated levels of inflation underway. This time it might be this epic breakout in the Dow Jones that is signaling that a big wave of inflation is underway.

While an inflationary environment is not a bad thing for investors we would certainly not prefer accelerated inflation. That’s NOT good. Things may get out of hand and we might find ourselves in a situation in which there is no place to hide.

We are no conspiracy theorists nor perma bulls or perma bears. We are realistic. And our healthy dose of realism tells us that high levels of inflation will not be a fun environment to make investing decisions.

What is the best way to handle rising stocks but also protect from elevated levels of inflation? Consistently building up your portfolio is the one and only answer. You have to grow your portfolio so you can create options in the long term. There will be different and multiple options to protect from high levels of inflation and it all starts with a growing portfolio that allows for the right type of protection in the future.

Future protection will come from a combination of currencies specific stocks and presumably precious metals.

DTE Electric had requested approval of a one-time regulatory liability and accounting authority to use a portion of unexpectedly higher profits from changed electricity use patterns of its retail customers amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The utility said the money would fund an additional surge in tree trimming in response to the summer’s storms. The trimming is expected to take place during the remainder of 2021 through 2023.

The $70 million is in addition to $283 million the Public Service Commission authorized DTE to spend on tree trimming in 2019-2021 the commission said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbm4tYXJib3IvMjAyMS8xMS9oZXJlcy1ob3ctY2l0eS1vd25lZC1zb2xhci1taWNyb2dyaWRzLWNvdWxkLXBvd2VyLWFubi1hcmJvci1ob21lcy1hbmQtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy5odG1s0gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Fubi1hcmJvci8yMDIxLzExL2hlcmVzLWhvdy1jaXR5LW93bmVkLXNvbGFyLW1pY3JvZ3JpZHMtY291bGQtcG93ZXItYW5uLWFyYm9yLWhvbWVzLWFuZC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here’s how city-owned solar microgrids could power Ann Arbor homes and businesses,"ANN ARBOR MI — Ann Arbor is exploring the idea of creating city-owned solar microgrids to power neighborhoods and meet the community’s 2030 carbon-neutrality goals.

With rapidly advancing technology in the electric vehicle sector UNCA takes steps to try to keep up with the growing need for infrastructure support but it won’t be easy said UNCA Interim Co-Director of Sustainability and Environmental Specialist Jackie Hamstead.

“If E.V. ownership grows exponentially as expected it will be difficult to keep up with” Hamstead said.

In North Carolina Asheville helps to lead electric vehicle integration in the state according to retired automotive engineer Dave Erb.

“Bottom line Asheville is a place that is very open to new ideas and this is no exception” Erb said. “We’re very much a leader. If you go back to when hybrids like the Prius first came out we were one of the parts of the state that adopted those really quickly. They weren’t every car on the road but we picked up hybrids quickly here. The same thing has been happening for the last 10 years with plug-in electric vehicles.”

In 2011 0.1% of all new car sales were electric. In the first half of 2021 that figure rose to 2.5% according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Despite the 25 times increase work must continue said Duke Energy’s North Carolina Electric Transportation Manager Donald Hamilton.

“Recently 72% of the car sales in Norway were electric compared to 2.5% in the U.S. So the US has a long way to go” Hamilton said. “The current administration has lofty goals that should help accelerate the E.V. sales across the U.S. This should help everyone achieve their carbon goals but we need to get those past legislation for that to become a reality. I do anticipate E.V. sales will continue to grow exponentially.”

To increase these sales figures supply chain upgrades will be necessary said retired engineer David Hrivnak.

“I think the change is already underway” he said. “The challenge now is the supply chain the demand is there we’re waiting for it to catch up so manufacturers can sell electric vehicles in volume.”

With this change underway UNCA anticipates more demand for E.V. chargers but supply chain issues hampered UNCA charger installations according to Hamstead.

Current support for electric vehicles includes four existing chargers on campus with two located at the P12 deck and two outside of the Reuter Center. Installation of the newest charging stations at the P12 deck in 2018 was thanks to a $10000 grant from Duke Energy.

According to Hamstead UNCA is already preparing for the increase in electric vehicle ownership among students and faculty.

Administrators and staff work to identify future locations for electric vehicle charging stations on campus with current plans to install several new chargers this fall she said.

“We received a grant to support the installation of four new E.V. chargers in P19 lot across from Brown Hall” Hamstead said. “We hope to have these installed by the end of the year. Campus operations and the Office of Sustainability have also partnered to purchase two new chargers that will replace the ones at the Reuter Center that are out of order.”

In addition to other concerns she said UNCA faces difficulties with getting chargers installed due to issues with the nation’s supply chain.

“Supply chain issues are impacting E.V. charging infrastructure much like everything else right now” Hamstead said. “Chargers are on backorder and take months to receive. E.V. charging stations require a lot of electrical and networking infrastructure which ramps up the cost and limits where chargers can be installed. Sustainable transportation is a rapidly evolving field. We are working to stay current with the latest technologies that might address some of the most common challenges.”

Current chip-based supply chain issues led to difficulty in finding electric vehicles to test drive making some potential electric vehicle buyers hesitant according to Erb.

“Drivers are hesitant but irrationally hesitant” Erb said. “My challenge as an advocate is to break through that irrationality. The fact is this is a great area for electric vehicles and any place where you have a significant rural population is a really good place for electric vehicles because that dramatic difference in the per mile cost of energy people in rural areas commute a lot farther than people in urban areas do.”

Erb Hamilton Hrivnak and other members of the local Blue Ridge E.V. Club work as supporters of the electric vehicle movement in the region.

Recently UNCA partnered with the Blue Ridge E.V. Club to hold an electric vehicle show during Greenfest.

“The goal of these events is to provide an opportunity for the campus community to be able to see a variety of electric vehicles and meet their owners” Hamstead said.

The challenge in introducing the public to electric vehicles lies within accessibility Erb said.

“The best way to have people make the change to electric vehicles is to have them drive them talk to a neighbor who owns one to really understand what they’re like” he said.

According to Erb although it may seem daunting the systems to sustain electric vehicles exist already to an extent.

“There’s about 280 million cars in this country. If somehow the ‘E.V. fairy’ came and made those cars electric then we would be sorely lacking in infrastructure” he said. “Although we would not be as far off as a lot of people think because everybody with a house has the infrastructure to charge their car.”

In the past 10 years the number of electric vehicle charging stations in North Carolina increased 416-fold from just six chargers in 2011 to 2497 chargers in 2021 according to a report by the U.S. Department of Energy.

This coupled with the existing home infrastructure acts as a sufficient grid for most electric vehicle owners according to Hamilton.

“I have two level II chargers” he said. “One at my house on the coast and one at my parents’ house in Western N.C. I use these chargers for 95% of my charging needs the same as most people.”

Duke Energy plans to incorporate more chargers across the state in an effort to provide more support for electric vehicle owners according to Hamilton.

“Near term we plan to install 20 DC Fast chargers across N.C. along highway corridors” he said. “We plan to install 80 level II chargers at multifamily dwellings 160 level II chargers at public spaces including libraries public parks and community colleges. We are governed by the N.C. utilities commission and are seeking substantially more chargers in the coming years but we will have to wait to hear their ruling.”

To finance chargers beyond Duke Energy’s plans funds come from a settlement from Volkswagen provided after the emissions lawsuit according to Hamilton.

“I am a member of the N.C. Highway Electrification Coalition and we are working with federal and state stakeholders to push the infrastructure” he said. “The VW settlement funds are now being allocated across the state which will also help expand that.”

These funds also assisted in funding the planned charger upgrades on UNCA’s campus Hamstead said.

“We got $20000 from the VW settlement which is administered by N.C. DEQ” she said. “The grant supported the project but didn’t fund it completely we will also have to use university funds.”

While greater charging infrastructure should be implemented increases in range helped to mitigate that need Erb said.

In 2011 electric vehicle range on average was 68 miles. By 2020 that figure increased by 281% to 259 miles according to a report from the U.S. Department of Energy.

“The norm for mainstream cars 10 years ago was 80 to 100 miles. Now the norm is 200 to 250 for cars that are quite affordable. Basically any car that can go over 200 miles reliably and has a DC fast charge port can do pretty much everything you do in your gas car with almost zero inconveniences.”

Concerns over range persist but aren’t necessary according to Hrivnak.

“People say they won’t buy an E.V. until it goes over 400 500 600 miles of range but the reality is we take 650-mile trips in a day easily in our E.V.” he said. “No the range isn’t that high but we can charge it up fully over lunch.”

In considering ownership costs among various factors buyers consider maintenance and fuel efficiency two figures that decrease significantly with an electric vehicle according to Erb.

“Electric vehicles run for about three cents per mile of electricity that’s a good ballpark number for most of them” Erb said. “Based on gas being about three dollars a gallon a Prius doing 50 miles a gallon is costing you about six cents per mile of gas and that’s with one of the most efficient cars on the road. With the average gas car it’s costing you 12 cents per mile of gas.”

In North Carolina the average price per gallon of gas stands at $2.72. In contrast a comparable eGallon costs $0.96 183% cheaper according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy.

“The maintenance is much lower as well you don’t do oil changes you don’t do timing belt changes you don’t change spark plugs you don’t do tune-ups it’s just much cheaper to run” Erb said.

As for UNCA the school continues to monitor the need for electric vehicle infrastructure and support according to Hamstead.

“I’m not aware of a strong demand from students but we are watching market trends and anticipate an increased demand in the near future” she said.

The challenge of adapting and meeting the needs of electric vehicle adoption may be daunting but doable according to Erb.

“If we go really really fast it’s going to take us 20 years to convert over to electric vehicles” Erb said. “In that time the infrastructure will happen because we’ve done this before. Back in ‘50s and ‘60s mainly we went in this country from almost nobody having air conditioning in their house to almost everybody having it. That’s a huge increase in electric demand and we did it. That amount of load is a little smaller than the added load you will see from adding the infrastructure for electric vehicles. Nothing on this scale is easy but in the grand scheme of things it’s not that hard either.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3Mtam91cm5hbG9ubGluZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wZHRiMDA5Mjc1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Glenn Dreggors Obituary,"David Glenn Dreggors

Friday

No. 8 Prairie 47 No. 9 Genoa-Hugo 15 in New Raymer

On paper a matchup featuring an eighth seed and a ninth seed should be the most competitive of a first round of the postseason. That certainly wasn’t the case here as the Mustangs scored early and often while affording Genoa-Hugo (6-3) no such luxury.

Prairie led 28-0 by halftime.

The Mustangs improved to 7-4 and advanced to the second round of the four-round Class 1A 6-man playoffs. They face No. 1 Cheyenne Wells in the second round next weekend.

The unbeaten Tigers (10-0) advanced with a 73-14 win today against No. 16 Mountain Valley.

No. 4 Idalia 62 No. 13 Briggsdale 13 in Idalia

Briggsdale stayed within reach early trailing just 16-7 but quickly lost contact as Idalia scored 32 unanswered points in the second quarter to extend its lead to 48-7 by halftime.

The Wolves racked up 331 rushing yards led by junior Kye Towns who had 117 yards and four touchdowns on seven carries.

Idalia (8-2) advanced and will take on No. 5 Fleming (9-2) in the 1A 6-man second round next week.

The Falcons end their season at 7-4.

Saturday

No. 1 Eaton 45 No. 16 Kent Denver 6 in Eaton

In every conceivable way Eaton resembled the top-seeded defending state champion it is.

The Reds scored the game’s first 45 points leading 38-0 by halftime.

Eaton improved to 10-0 and has won 13 consecutive games dating back to this past season’s title campaign.

Today’s outcome was nothing new as the Reds have outscored their opponents 369-69 — an average of 37-6 — this season.

While Kent Denver ends its season at 5-4 Eaton advances to the second round of the 2A playoffs and will face No. 9 Elizabeth on the road next weekend.

The Cardinals (8-2) pulled off a minor upset earning a 17-0 road win against No. 8 Bayfield (7-2) today.

Elizabeth has won five consecutive games.

The Reds and Cardinals played early this season with Eaton producing a 31-7 nonleague road win Sept. 10.

No. 12 University 28 No. 5 Moffat County 14 in Craig

Undaunted by the task of going on the road for the first round of the 2A playoffs University comfortably secured its first playoff win in 35 years.

The Bulldogs methodically tacked on as the game progressed leading 13-7 at halftime and 21-14 after three quarters.

Moffat County ends its season at 8-2.

University improved to 6-4 and will play host to No. 4 Delta (9-1) next weekend.

The Panthers advanced with a 45-14 win today against No. 13 Alamosa (6-4).

No. 2 Resurrection Christian 56 No. 15 La Junta 15 in Loveland

Resurrection Christian’s offense was firing on all cylinders as the Cougars put up the highest point total of any team in the first round of the 2A playoffs.

Resurrection Christian improved to 8-1 and advanced to a high-interest second-round meeting at home next weekend against fellow Patriot League team No. 7 Brush (8-2) which topped No. 10 Basalt 43-23 today.

Even though the Cougars and Beetdiggers are both Patriot League teams they didn’t face each other in the regular season as they belong to two different divisions.

Brush won the East division while Resurrection Christian finished second to Eaton in the West.

With the win today the Cougars ended La Junta’s season at 5-5.

No. 7 Dayspring Christian 58 No. 10 Merino 30 in Greeley

What a difference a mere two weeks make.

Just a couple weeks ago Dayspring Christian wrapped up its regular season with a 30-22 1A 8-man Plains League loss to this same Merino team.

Today the Eagles were never in any real jeopardy of losing starting fast enough and closing emphatically to punch their ticket to the second round.

Dayspring senior quarterback Garrett Krehbiel had eight total touchdowns — six on the ground and two through the air. He also accounted for 547 of the Eagles’ 595 total yards of offense.

He completed 11 of 14 passes for 212 yards and carried the ball 15 times for 335 yards.

Senior Jacob Martin led Dayspring’s receiving corps with 113 yards and two touchdowns on three catches.

The Eagles improve to 7-3 and advance to take on second-seeded Mancos (8-0) in the second round next weekend.

Merino capped its season at 5-5.

No. 14 Bear Creek 24 No. 19 Windsor 7 in Lakewood

In a rematch of a nonleague game from earlier this season Windsor wasn’t able to keep the game quite as close this time around.

Bear Creek edged the Wizards 24-14 on Sept. 24 in Windsor.

Today Windsor trailed just 10-7 at halftime before the Bears scored 14 unanswered points in the second half.

The Wizards end their season at 4-7.

Bear Creek (8-3) advances to take on third-seeded Pine Creek (8-2) on the road in the second round of the 4A playoffs next weekend. The Eagles are coming off a first-round bye.

No. 5 Wray 34 No. 12 Highland 9 in Wray

For just the second time this season Highland was held to single-digit scoring. The Huskies came into this game averaging 28 points per game.

The only other time Highland was held to single digits was in a 19-7 road loss on Oct. 2 against Strasburg (6-4) which was the seventh seed in the 1A 11-man playoffs.

The Huskies end their season with a 6-4 record. Wray improves to 8-2 and moves on to a second-round game against No. 4 Florence (9-1) next weekend.

IDAHO FALLS — A curious 8-year-old girl from Idaho has caught the attention of big-name celebrities musicians and other creators around the country with her impressive interviewing skills.

In June of 2020 Emmy Eaton was on a river rafting trip in Island Park Idaho with her family where her dad EastIdahoNews.com news director Nate Eaton was doing a Facebook Live video. In the video comments someone suggested that Emmy who has always been a curious person interview her dad.

The following day Emmy interviewed her dad and asked him seven questions since she was seven years old at the time. She did a small number of other local interviews and then because of Nate Eaton's connection to Dateline NBC correspondent Keith Morrison and their work on the Chad and Lori Vallow Daybell case Morrison agreed to an interview with Emmy.

That was just the beginning of 7 Questions with Emmy a weekly video series featured on EastIdahoNews.com Facebook and YouTube.

""I've always been curious"" Emmy Eaton said. ""I've always loved asking questions because sometimes I'll ask mom and dad a bunch of questions when we are in the car like 'Why are we going to the store?' and 'Why are we going to do this and this?' … I get it from my dad.""

Nate Eaton said his daughter has never been shy. Whether she is interviewing a celebrity or a garbage man she is equally interested in the person.

Some of Emmy's interview subjects include a farmer a United Airlines employee Mike Rowe Jenny Oaks Baker Stephen Sharp Nelson a young widow Taysom Hill a wardrobe stylist and one of her favorites Drew Barrymore.

In fact her initial interview with Barrymore went so well she was invited to be a contributor on The Drew Barrymore Show. Emmy said it was amazing to meet Barrymore in real life.

""She's everything that she looks like on TV"" Emmy said. ""She's the most kindest genuine person that you'll ever meet. She's so nice.""

During one of her segments on the Drew Barrymore Show Emmy got to interview Elmo which she said was really fun.

The first time Emmy recorded in front of a live studio audience on The Drew Barrymore Show her dad was nervous and excited for her and worried that she'd forget her questions but she did perfectly. Nate Eaton said it brought tears to his eyes to see Emmy all grown up and doing something Nate has wanted to do since he was 12 — be a reporter.

Emmy's parents don't push her to be in the spotlight and they would be completely fine if she decided to stop doing her interviews at any point Nate Eaton said.

""So many things make me proud about watching her and it's been cool to see her interviewing skills progress from the beginning to now"" Nate Eaton said. ""It's been cool to see her style but what makes me proud is the stuff that is not written down the questions or anything. She can ad-lib so great. And she listens and she asks great follow-up questions and can go where the conversation goes rather than being stuck to a set list of questions.""

To come up with her interview questions Emmy does a lot of research and even sometimes designs PowerPoint presentations about her interviewees. She hopes to one day take over Drew Barrymore's job and her dream interviews are Justin Bieber Zac Efron and Kate Middleton.

""I hope to inspire (people)"" Emmy said ""just to make them really really happy and think good thoughts like rainbows and sparkles and unicorns and all those fun things.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vdHRpbmdoYW0tbmV3cy9pbnNpZGUtdHJlYXN1cmUtdHJvdmUtc2hvcC1hbG1vc3QtNjE2Mzg0MNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vdHRpbmdoYW0tbmV3cy9pbnNpZGUtdHJlYXN1cmUtdHJvdmUtc2hvcC1hbG1vc3QtNjE2Mzg0MC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside the treasure trove shop which is almost unchanged after 91 years,"Something went wrong please try again later.

A lot has changed in Long Eaton over the decades but one quiet corner has remained the same for almost 100 years.

While other shops and chains come and go Heaps the stationers has remained never faltering through war times legendary fires and monumental changes to retail.

Not only has this steadfast store on Main Street stayed in place for nine long decades it's also only had a handful of staff throughout that time with nothing even approaching the likes of staff turnover a modern shop would see.

At the helm of this fascinating treasure trove for the past 41 years having worked there in total for 56 years is Stuart Danvers now 76.

We find Stuart happily tending to his customers on a quiet Wednesday lunch where he spares us some time among the stacked out aisles to tell us a bit about his past half a century there and how he's never moved on because it's ""his life"".

Stuart sits as if in his own living room on a worn and well-loved armchair tucked at the back of the shop.

His backdrop is a wall of greetings cards - ""they're all only £1"" he makes sure to tell us. By his feet are neatly displayed jigsaw puzzles to his sides walls of myriad art supplies which he says are what he's mostly known for.

(Image: Joseph Raynor/ Nottingham Post)

""Yes the shop has been since circa 1930 - It belong to Mr Heaps until 1955 and then Mr Hooley took it on.

""I arrived at the age of 23 in 1968 to work here and I loved it.

""By 1979 Mr Hooley was ready to retire and he asked me to take on the shop and I was delighted to. It was my life.""

In many ways the town of Long Eaton on the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire border has changed beyond recognition and Stuart has seen much of that.

While there's the very distinct feeling that Stuart is not one to mince his words he does choose them carefully when describing the Long Eaton of today but something in his body language gives away a sadness over some of the changes a feeling that's perhaps only usual for someone who wears their town and their place in it like a second skin.

""Oh so much has changed in all these years yes"" he sighs

""Losing the Co-op across the road had a big impact. I lost a lot of foot fall when that went and it changed this little area a bit.

(Image: Joseph Raynor/ Nottingham Post)

""The big supermarkets coming in have changed things too it's not about the competition I don't worry about that because I've got no overheads but they change the nature of a place a bit and the way people shop. You can park for free in the big shops so people go there and then don't go anywhere else. They get what they want in there.""

But while new ways of shopping have come to the masses there's still a core of customers that give Heaps a reason to open its doors every day.

""My customers are very loyal"" says Stuart. ""I have some people who've been coming in here for decades. I'm on to the grandchildren of some of them now I know them that well.

""Mind you I've known some of them that long they've started telling me the same stories I've heard before"" he laughs before quipping ""I'm too old for it now I don't have the patience I just say 'you've already told me!'

Stuart laughs at the anecdote showing his back and forth with his customers happens with fondness rather that frustration.

The shop is almost packed to the rafters with stock and it's hard not to wonder how he shifts it but he says it's ""one of the last independent stores in Long Eaton where you can buy pretty much anything.""

There's a huge selection of jigsaws painting by numbers and children's art sets as well as walls and walls of paints pencils paper clips canvases paint brushes and more.

He also sells items it might be tricky to find elsewhere like candle wicks and plaster of paris and an array of maps that even he admits ""people don't need as much now what with Sat Nav"" yet they're clearly part of store's fabric.

The shop's fittings have barely changed in 100 years the bumpy walls and cracked corners affectionately - and expectedly showing the building's Grade-I listed age.

Over his time there Stuart has simply become part of those fixtures and fittings still donning a tie each morning for a day at work still he says never being sure what each day might bring.

""I've just kept going I've been here so long that any changes happen gradually really you don't notice time just goes by.

""All the nearby nightclubs have gone now which is good. They used to stay open until 4am and the building would shake all night. I'd heard glass shattering but got used to not bothering unless the shop alarm was going off.""

(Image: Joseph Raynor/ Nottingham Post)

One of the biggest events Stuart recalls with sorrow was the Long Eaton teabag factory fire of 1971. Flames tore through the building just across the road from the shop and the whole area was in chaos.

""I remember there was an Evening Post seller on the corner outside and he came running in to tell us the factory was going up and I didn't believe him! But of course it was. I saw the whole gable end of the building fall away in flames and women on the top floors screaming. People were shouting 'don't jump'.

He also recalls a time when a gang of youngsters roughed the shop up a little entering en-masse and tearing into stock when Stuart took them to task.

He installed cameras after that but that's the extent of the shop's modernisation.

""Oh the customer's say 'don't change Stuart' and I won't - I'd just be the same as everywhere else then wouldn't I?"" he says.

Astonishingly he still uses a 1930s cash register and behind the counter is a wall lamp which also hails from the 30s. It doesn't work but that doesn't matter.

One of the only things to annoy Stuart about his 50 odd year old job is when customers come in looking for something specific having been to dozens of other stores first.

""They'll say 'do you know Stuart I've been everywhere for one of these and I knew you'd have one' so I think 'well why didn't you come here in the first place then?"" He grins widely and something in that smile says he still thrives on the challenge of meeting their needs.

And this little corner of Long Eaton unchanged for so long isn't likely to change for some time yet either. When asked if he'll ever hang up his hat Stuart thinks for the shortest of seconds before quietly answering: ""Only if I get bored. And I'm not bored yet.""

Codes have been going out this week so that developer From Software can see how the game's online elements perform under player stress-testing and if you didn't get a closed network key your only option left is to pay an extortionate price for one on eBay.

As spotted by VGC several scalpers have listed Elden Ring closed network test keys for sale charging between $150 and over $500 for the code. These aren't just the prices being asked by scalpers as fans are actually bidding for a chance to get an early hands-on experience with Elden Ring.

Elden Ring scalpers are charging a hefty premium

While we're not exactly that well-versed in the law regarding the sale of network test and beta keys for upcoming games such activity likely won't sit well with publisher Bandai Namco. For those of you who have received a code legitimately the test is still scheduled to take place from November 12 and will run for three days over several three-hour slots:

November 12 - 3 AM PT / 6 AM ET

- 3 AM PT / 6 AM ET November 12 - 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET

- 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET November 13 - 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET

From Software released an in-depth breakdown of Elden Ring's gameplay last week showcasing over 20 minutes of exploration action and a boss fight with a well-armed opponent. Slightly delayed from its original January 2022 release date Elden Ring launches for Xbox One Xbox Series X|S PS4 PS5 and PC on February 25.

Sure maybe you’ve bought kicks resale before. But have you tried to cop a pair from a man whose sneaker collection has been valued at over $1 million dollars? Well now you have the chance. eBay is teaming up with a host of the most prominent sneaker collectors in the game including the infamous connoisseur DJ Skee for “The Sleigh Drop” — a curated exclusive sneaker sale offering insider access to elite collections of kicks.

“The Sleigh Drop” taps DJ Skee La La Anthony and Jacques Slade for weekly drops dipping into their personal archives starting November 5 and running through December. Skee’s collection (he wears size 11 and 12 for all those on the edge of their seats) is on the docket first with more than 700 pairs of limited-edition rare or otherwise hot footwear releasing every Friday through the end of the month.

The campaign comes as the holiday season ramps up and eBay looks to give back to its patrons. “Sneaker collecting is all about community and eBay always puts its community of buyers and sellers first” said Garry Thaniel General Manager of Sneakers at eBay. “Launching exclusive drops is one of the ways we continue to deliver an unparalleled experience.”

Indeed eBay sneakers seems to be going to great lengths to provide the best experience possible for their buyers and sellers; there are zero seller fees for sneakers over $100. Perhaps to an even great end eBay has partnered with third-party authenticators under the “Authenticity Guarantee” service to inspect and authenticate sneakers over $100 at no fee. Since inception this service has authenticated over $1 million items and saved sellers more than $17 million in fees per eBay.

The sneaker experience doesn’t stop there either. 3D true view technology can provide a 360 view of kicks pre-purchase a function eBay is in the process of rolling out starting with a handful of sellers November 18.

We caught up with DJ Skee for a quick Q&A about “The Sleigh Drop” and his origins in the sneaker game. You can read the interview below — and make sure to follow along with “The Sleigh Drop” and @ebaysneakers for exclusive chances at some of the hottest kicks to ever grace this earth.

InsideHook: How did you get started collecting kicks?

DJ Skee: I started collecting shoes as a kid. The original Concord Air Jordan XI was what sparked my obsession. I became obsessed after I went to get the black/red pair after school (when Jordans were still released on Wednesdays) and they were sold out. That drew me into the life of the forever chase of what’s next as a sneakerhead.

Let’s hear it: how many pairs in the collection? What’s the most expensive pair you own? Your favorite? And can we get a holy trinity of sneakers?

DJS: A couple thousand! The most expensive would likely be some of the game-worn or signed pairs I have from MJ LeBron Griffey and 1/1 samples. My favorite trinity: Concord XI Air Max 90 Infrared Air Griffey 1.

How did the partnership with eBay come to be? What are you most proud to show off during The Sleigh Drop?

DJS: I’ve been buying and selling on eBay since I was a teenager so this partnership was a natural one and really is completely full circle for me. I’m super excited to showcase some 1/1 pairs with crazy stories behind them like original signed Jordan XIs DJ AM’s Serato AF1s game-worn NBA Finals LeBrons game-worn Griffey cleats my 1/1 Skee Air Force 1’s from Nike and more.

Obviously you know a thing or two about buying and selling sneakers. Can we get some pro tips on how to finesse the sneaker game on eBay?

DJS: The real rewards come to those who hunt! Set alerts to be notified for new releases. Also everyone searches for the same terms so see if you can get lucky and find hidden gems that may be listed under a different title — I’ve gotten some steals in the past this way!

Brands have found a way to make adults and teenagers pay much higher prices by putting a twist on average products like the $120 “Gucci” Hot Wheels toy car from Mattel.

eBay followed StockX in capitalizing on this trend in the sneakers market – it wasn’t that long ago that authenticating sneakers was unheard of – and a small number of other categories such as luxury watches and handbags. eBay is telling Wall Street that while its buyer base is shrinking (active buyers were down by 5% at the end of September) its strategy of targeting “high value buyers” who will spend more across its platform will pay off.

But emphasizing sneakers and a few other categories doesn’t cut it for sellers who list different products. In a recent AuctionBytes blog post about Etsy’s new holiday TV commercials a reader said that as an eBay seller they wished eBay would advertise – “and not just sneakers or high-end watches.”

The reader said “I haven’t seen an eBay ad for years but when I did the focus was very narrow and didn’t convey the scope of what is available. And yes at the very least they should be decorating the pages with holiday reminders!”

Some of the other things sellers are talking about:

eBay is requiring some buyers to agree to pay immediately upon a seller’s acceptance of their Best Offer.

PayPal is requiring sellers to provide an “online verifiable” tracking number to prove delivery to qualify for seller protection.

Amazon is cracking down on sellers who advertise rebates or discounts on other sites in order to get incentivized product reviews on its marketplace.

Speaking of bad seller behavior — in today’s issue Kenneth Corbin reports on a government crackdown on fake reviews and deceptive endorsements.

5 Even Ebay Had To Grapple With Hosting Nazi Content Love it or hate it eBay has undoubtedly revolutionized online shopping. Not only can you order vintage porno magazines from the '30s all within the comfort of your home but you can do it anonymously. The wonders of technology come with their own perils however. Much like how modern websites like Facebook and Twitter deal with fascists on their platforms all of the time nowadays eBay had its own run-in with Nazi stuff back in its heyday. Well the issue there wasn't so much Nazis coordinating or preaching Nazi ideology—an auction house really isn't the best forum for political organizing. With eBay the issue was a whole lot of people selling Nazi memorabilia. Joe Mabel ""It's not memorabilia! They're historical artifacts!""

""Dude it's memorabilia."" See back in the late '90s eBay had basically no regulations in terms of what people could buy and sell. Today they have a long list of prohibited items everything from secondhand underwear to freshly squeezed orange juice but it used to be anything goes. That meant people sold Nazi flags Nazi medals secondhand Nazi underwear freshly squeezed Nazi juice etc. Advertisement The only time eBay restricted sales of Nazi goodies was if the buyer was in a country that banned the merchandise such as Germany. That's where the real parallels to today come: Places like Facebook would later defer to country-specific laws when regulating both Nazi symbols and Holocaust denial. Postfiy/Facebook ""We also haven't fixed our interface because crappy UIs are legal except for in Germany."" EBay suffered through headaches and PR upsets over the Nazi stuff so in 2001 they banned Nazi sales across the website entirely. Sorry Hitler fans.

4 Myspace Got Sued For Mass Censorship Back In 2006 We hear lots of calls for social media sites to crack down harder on those Nazis but the sites actually censor political content all the time ... for stupid reasons. Some people describe this as a crusade against conservatives but no you also get websites like Twitter suspiciously removing left-wing accounts for no ‘apparent’ reason and Facebook too removing the accounts of political activists without warning or cause. It makes you wish for the good old days when people could post whatever they liked (and mostly chose to post blinking text). Myspace On a site run by a guy who looked cool instead of some sentient candle Advertisement And yet those days weren’t as free as we remember. Myspace got sued for censoring content all the way back in 2006 back when social media content consisted mainly of you listing your favorite pop-punk bands and rom-coms. The plaintiff was Myspace's own co-founder Brad Greenspan who said the site was now censoring all links and references to his new competing site LiveUniverse as well as links to competitors Stickam.com and vidiLife.com. Advertisement This was just one of a bunch of suits Greenspan filed against Myspace. He also claimed the site undervalued itself a hundred times over when it sold itself to News Corp depriving Greenspan of a huger payday. Sadly we can find no follow up about what happened with the censorship suit so we have to assume some judge threw it out on the grounds of ""lol it's Myspace who cares."" Advertisement

3 Napster’s Lawsuit Changed The Industry For Future Music Platforms Like Spotify And Tidal Nowadays we all take for granted having access to every song ever made at our fingertips via streaming platforms but it wasn’t always like that. Before streaming services people actually bought music. Crazy right? But now you can listen to how terrible Ed Sheeran is without paying a single cent. The wonders of technology. Harald Krichel He gets all the gold he needs from pots at the end of rainbows. Between music sales and music streaming however came the golden age of music piracy ushered in by Napster. Created in 1999 by not just Sean Parker but also Shawn Fanning whose uncle John Fanning created Chess.net Napster allowed users to pirate music using peer-to-peer connections. People had always been able to buy bootleg recordings but for the first time the world's collection of music was available to everyone everywhere for no charge. Advertisement Great news for people who want free stuf not so great news for artists and labels. Cue the year 2000 when Metallica found out that their track “I Disappear” was leaked early on Napster leading to the Metallica v. Napster Inc lawsuit. The case was decided in favor of Metallica and other artists such as Dr. Dre soon whipped out lawsuits of their own. The staggering number of court cases were eventually too much for Napster to bear so the company shut down in 2001. Whoops. Napster They also quit because they were unable to explain why their logo was a cat. Advertisement Eventually the music industry wised up and invested in streaming services which is why we have Tidal Spotify Apple streaming and so on today. These are totally different from Napster right since it's all legal and the labels do get paid (tiny amounts)? Eh don't be sure about that. Because streaming services still get sued for copyright infringement. Advertisement Like when one of The Four Seasons Bob Gaudio sued Spotify back in 2017. Yes Spotify was paying for the right to play those songs. But Gaudio argued that the service was also broadcasting and reproducing the songs which is a whole other thing. Spotify did end up settling this suit as well as an even bigger one filed on similar grounds by BMG Music. They had to pay more money and then they went on streaming “The Shape of You” so in a way we're all losers.

2 Net Neutrality Debates Have Been Around Since The '90s In 2017 former F.C.C Chairman Ajit Pai became the most hated man on the internet when he repealed net neutrality rules allowing companies to slow down websites based on whatever profitable whims they follow. This was pretty upsetting to the internet for obvious reasons. This battle however goes way back to the '90s. Göteborgs Historiska Museums The 1890s!

No wait sorry. It was the 1990s. Advertisement While the term ""net neutrality"" was born in 2003 experts were lecturing about the need for some kind of protection a decade before that before the FCC had even laid out vague principles on the subject. Back then advocates called it ""end-to-end"" which was their attempt at a very neutral net term more neutral than ""business-to-consumer"" or anything like that. The phrase ""end-to-end"" in turn actually came from the '80s when it referred to phone networks. Advertisement The big takeaway from this is that we should always know our past so that we’re better prepared for what comes in the future. That and screw Ajit Pai’s big Reese’s mug."

Early feasibility data from two studies of valve replacement presented at TCT 2021 show promise for novel transcatheter devices for mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

The Intrepid (Medtronic) transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) early feasibility study showed no mortality stroke reintervention or new pacemaker implantation within 30 days in the first 15 patients treated via the transseptal approach. Also 6-month outcomes from the TRISCEND study confirmed what was seen at 30 days with significant reductions in tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and good survival following transcatheter implantation of the Evoque device (Edwards Lifesciences).

“This is the future” commented Luigi Salemme MD (Montevergine Clinic Mercogliano Italy) during a press conference. “We are moving to an interventional treatment of tricuspid and mitral disease.”

Intrepid EFS

Firas Zahr MD (Oregon Health and Science University Portland) who presented the Intrepid findings told TCTMD that “for an early feasibility study these are very encouraging results.” The trileaflet bovine pericardial valve which affixes to the mitral valve with outer stent anchors without capturing the native leaflets is identical to that already being studied transapically in the ongoing APOLLO trial where “the morbidity and mortality early on is very high due to the complications [related to] transapical access as well as its impact on the myocardial muscle” Zahr said. With a transseptal delivery system what is novel here “the hope was that will address some of these concerns.”

For the multicenter study which was simultaneously published in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions Zahr and colleagues implanted 15 patients (mean age 80 years; 87% male) with at least moderate-to-severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) who were at high or extreme risk for mitral valve surgery with the Intrepid TMVR valve which was mounted on a 35-Fr transfemoral delivery system. At baseline 67% of patients were classified as NYHA class III or IV.

Average procedural time was 46 minutes and most patients (93%) received the 48-mm valve. Notably one patient was converted to a sternotomy due to valve migration. Atrial septal defect closure was performed in 73% of patients and mean length of stay was 5 days. One patient had a periprocedural MI due to an air embolism.

At 30 days there were no reports of all-cause death stroke reintervention new pacemakers or acute kidney injury stage 2 or higher. Seven patients reported MVARC-defined major bleeding events including six major vascular complications all related to the access site. One patient was rehospitalized due to a minor vascular complication.

Echocardiography at discharge showed 21% of patients with mild MR but by 30 days all patients had none or trace MR. Paravalvular leak was seen in 7% at discharge but disappeared in all by 30 days. Also LV outflow tract obstruction was moderate in 15% of patients at discharge but zero or mild in all at 30 days.

Functional outcomes were good with 57% and 29% being classified as NYHA class II and I respectively at 30 days.

Based on these results Zahr reported that the transfemoral delivery system will now be rolled into the APOLLO pivotal trial. “Maneuvering the system has proven in the study to be relatively straightforward” he said. “Despite the fact that it's early feasibility most of the procedures were done under 1 hour because maneuvering the valve to the mitral annulus is very similar to maneuvering other devices that are commercially available in the mitral space.”

He admitted that the vascular complications observed were “a bit higher than we were hoping for” although this is likely related to early experience and variability in anticoagulation regimens as well as “trying to figure out what's the best way to use the venous system for a large-bore sheath.” A 29-Fr delivery system is currently in development Zahr said. “I'm hoping that as the sheath is getting smaller . . . as well as us learning what's the best way to manage vascular access and the best way for us to anticoagulate those patients perioperatively that will hopefully address some of those bleeding complications.”

In the press conference Rajiv Tayal MD (Valley Health System Ridgewood NJ) said “this is clearly an exciting look into the future and very reassuring to a degree aside from the complications which are somewhat expected as we go with 30-plus Fr devices. I think it's incredible and I'm very excited for it.”

Moderator Roxana Mehran MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY) said she too was excited about the results even though “35-Fr scares the dickens out of me.” For the next phase “this obviously would be best approached to see this in a smaller French size.”

TRISCEND at 6 Months

Presenting the 6-month results of TRISCEND Susheel Kodali MD (NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York NY) said the Evoque system which securely attaches into the tricuspid annulus by “engaging leaflets chords and the annulus” demonstrated that the favorable 30-day outcomes were sustained at 6 months.

Of the 132 patients enrolled (mean age 79.2%; 74% female) 6-month follow-up was available for 56. Baseline TR grade was at least severe in 88% of patients and 90% had atrial fibrillation; 67% of patients were in class III/IV heart failure prior to implantation. Procedural device success was 96.2% with most (94.7%) having right vein femoral access.

At 30 days 18.5% reported major adverse events including three cardiovascular deaths one renal complication 22 severe bleeds two major access-site and vascular complications two reinterventions and one major cardiac structural complication. The all-cause mortality rate was 3.2% and eight patients required a new permanent pacemaker.

At 6 months TR severity was mild in 49% with the remaining 51% reporting none or trace levels (P < 0.001 vs baseline). Both the rates of survival (96%) and freedom from heart failure hospitalization (94%) were high at 6 months. Also significant improvements were seen in NYHA class with 89% of patients in class I or II at 6 months; 6-minute walk distance with an increase of 56 m; and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score with an increase of 27 points (P < 0.001 for all).

As a result of these and earlier findings the randomized pivotal TRISCEND II trial is already underway.

Kodali stressed to TCTMD the importance of new transcatheter devices to treat TR. “There's not really great options for these patients” he said adding that the number of patients he’s seen in the clinic over the last several years has been “steadily increasing.” Kodali also noted that challenges in this space have related to adequate imaging and that even the procedurally-challenging edge-to-edge technologies can still leave patients with moderate or even significant TR.

The biggest hurdle right now with this system relates to the high bleeding rate he said. “A lot of them are not access-site—urinary tract GI other factors—but this is a patient population that has sort of high bleeding risk to begin with. But 17% at 30 days is definitely a significant bleeding rate and we need to understand why that is and we have to manage anticoagulation differently. It's important to dive more deeply into this and do better.”

Ultimately the data show that “the device works” Kodali said. “I think it's a reproducible procedure and I think from a feasibility standpoint it showed that it's feasible. You can eliminate TR patients in general have done well. Whether this is clinically beneficial I think the randomized trial is designed to show that.”

In the press conference Mehran questioned the need for tricuspid replacement as opposed to repair. “It just seems like it's a big to-do” she said. “Do you think that there are so many pitfalls to the repair that you need a replacement?”

Previous edge-to-edge repair studies like CLASP TR and TRILUMINATE have shown benefit but also have limitations related to “large gaps broad jets [and] imaging” Kodali said. “So there are trade-offs. I think over the next decade-plus we're going to need to understand which patients benefit which way and I think that's where the real knowledge gap is. We have a long way to go. We're just trying to get to the point [to know if] treating TR helps these patients.”

Tayal commented that this procedure “clearly seems to be a little bit more straightforward” than other investigational technologies to date.",,,,,,,,,

Hilton is many things – a reality star an heiress an unlikely lockdown fitness guru who uses designer handbags instead of weights. But until now she has never been considered a significant player in the art world. When artists have acknowledged her often they’ve done so to fetishise her image. In 2008 Damien Hirst bought a portrait of her by the artist Jonathan Yeo in which her body is constructed from collaged images cut from porn magazines.

Yet in the past year she’s become a surreal figurehead in the NFT scene: a world flush with crypto dollars and high on a promise to transform the worlds of art and commerce. When we speak Hilton has just returned from a bitcoin conference in Miami where customers paid up to $25000 for VIP tables at the opening party to watch her DJ in a pair of diamanté-encrusted headphones. “NFT stands for non-fungible token a digital token that is redeemable for a digital piece of art” she explains. “You can have it on your computer server or your phone. I have these screens in my house where I display them.”

Sure enough at Hilton’s Beverly Hills mansion there are screens displaying NFTs she made in collaboration with the digital artist Blake Kathryn. These include a video of a chihuahua on top of a rotating ionic column (a tribute to her deceased pet Tinkerbell) and an animated self-portrait of Hilton as a sparkling CGI Barbie floating in the clouds a piece she’s called Iconic Crypto Queen and which she sold in April for more than $1m.

Hilton first started investing in cryptocurrency in 2016. “I became friends with the founders of Ethereum” she says. (Ethereum produces ether the currency in which the majority of NFTs are traded.) Since then she’s thrown herself into collecting crypto art and owns more than 150 NFTs.

To advocates of the NFT the technology offers a revolutionary new way of selling art and of circumventing snooty cultural gatekeepers whose resistance to a crypto future seems as square as the 19th-century Parisian art world’s disdain for impressionism. In this context the relevance of Hilton’s brand to the NFT movement makes sense. Pink jewel-encrusted and openly motivated by being as rich and famous as humanly possible she’s a far cry from the type of person whose work is typically exhibited in blue-chip galleries or hung in booths at art fairs.

Yet Hilton’s endorsement may also be ammunition for those who view the NFT as just another depressing example of the speculative logic of finance monopolising taste. To detractors from critic Waldemar Januszczak to artist David Hockney the NFT marketplace is a home for morally bankrupt environmentally vandalistic money-grabbers whose creations barely qualify as art.

While most of us are still trying to remember what “fungible” means a battle is under way to define how NFTs are understood. Are they a vital cultural product that tells us something profound about digital consumerism? Or are they just the latest cynical way to make absurd amounts of money?

A motley crew of celebrities have tried their hand at selling digital art including Snoop Dogg Lindsay Lohan and John Cleese. In July it was estimated that sales of NFTs in the first half of 2021 rose by more than $2bn (£1.47bn) – a trend that prompted Christie’s and Sotheby’s to host their own NFT auctions and that is credited with driving contemporary art sales to an all-time high. But only a tiny proportion of the proceeds of art NFTs have ended up in the bank accounts of the galleries that have in addition to auction houses traditionally taken the lion’s share of art-market profits.

In March the crypto firm Injective Protocol paid $95000 for Morons a physical artwork by Banksy depicting an auctioneer selling a framed picture bearing the words: “I can’t believe you morons actually buy this shit.” They then burned the picture before selling a digital token of the work for $380000. The event was a marketing ploy designed to stoke outrage drum up publicity and turn a profit. Yet the symbolism was potent: digital art is here to replace its physical forebear and its coming supremacy should be reflected by a higher price tag.

In essence an NFT is a digital certificate of ownership almost always bought and sold using cryptocurrency to which any digital file – a jpeg image file a video a song – can be attached. That Hilton is able to display Iconic Crypto Queen in her home despite having sold it is part of the NFT’s appeal – and the challenge it poses to the established business model for trading and accessing art. With a simple Google search anybody can find and download the file associated with an NFT for nothing and store it on their phone or computer but only the owner has the right to sell it. Each NFT is unique and all transactions are logged on the blockchain a type of database invented in 2008 for the purpose of recording the movement of cryptocurrency.

Unlike the commercial gallery business model NFTs are designed to cut out the need for art dealers enabling artists to trade directly online typically via specialist auction sites. Crucially in contrast to the contemporary art world there is no “vetting” of collectors – a practice intended to stop the most speculative buyers flipping artworks by quickly reselling them at a profit. Anybody can buy an NFT and prices so often a thing of mystery in high-end commercial galleries are listed as a matter of public record. Every time an NFT is resold its creator also makes a profit – an inbuilt royalty system missing from the physical art world where artists often feel as if they have been shafted when their work is resold on the secondary market.

A model for trading and sharing art built on the principles of financial transparency royalties and easy access for all may sound egalitarian. The reality has been rather different. As soon as it became apparent that almost anything digital could be labelled as art and sold the circus rolled into town.

In March Everydays: The First 5000 Days a collage of previous artworks by a 40-year-old American named Mike Winkelmann better known as Beeple sold for $69.3m at Christie’s New York. After that Kate Moss sold a gif of herself for more than $17000. Jack Dorsey CEO of Twitter sold an image of the first ever tweet for $2.9m. A Brooklyn film director managed to sell an audio file of his own farts for $85. Dominic Cummings even threatened to use the technology against Boris Johnson by releasing what he said was evidence of government malpractice in the form of an NFT.

Along the way the market became gratuitously inflated. Bidders at the top end included Vignesh Sundaresan a blockchain entrepreneur who bought Beeple’s $69m NFT. A considerable number of small-time enthusiasts were also buying at the affordable end of the market keen to celebrate the technology by investing in blockchain art. It didn’t take long before the bubble burst. By May daily sales of NFTs had dropped by 60%. Crypto art’s reputation has also taken a knock because of its awful environmental track record. (The annual energy consumption of Ethereum is estimated to equal that of Iceland.)

Despite this advocates still believe NFTs can mount a challenge to the monopoly on trading art held by commercial galleries and even create a future where physical artworks are replaced by their digital counterparts. As Hilton puts it: “There are paintings out there that are $100m or more but if you think about it it’s really just canvas with paint.”

In the beginning before the circus pitched up there were nerds. Inevitably because this is the internet there were also cats. CryptoKitties to be precise is an online game launched in 2017 enabling players to trade and “breed” unique cartoon felines sold as NFTs using blockchain technology. Although the first NFT was created by a man named Kevin McCoy in 2014 CryptoKitties attracted attention and money with some cats trading for hundreds of thousands of dollars. During 2020 as cryptocurrencies boomed and the pandemic accelerated our transformation into a species of screen-obsessed zombies interest in NFTs rapidly picked up pace. As a consequence the value of work by a relatively small number of artists already on the scene rocketed.

Among them was Trevor Jones a 51-year-old painter who lives in Edinburgh. You’ve probably never heard of Jones but he’s the most successful NFT artist working in the UK. He started making NFTs in 2019. “Five years ago I was struggling to pay the mortgage” he tells me. “I went from having to borrow money from friends to pay the bills to making $4m in a day.”

Jones has made a name for himself combining painting with digital technology often producing pastiches of famous artworks with a crypto twist. In 2020 Bitcoin Bull – an animated painting of a Picasso-inspired bull decorated with bitcoin logos and Twitter birds – was bought by a prominent crypto collector named Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile for $55555.55.

Jones is warm unguarded and stunned by his rapid ascent. “I grew up in a little logging community” he says of his childhood in western Canada a place he describes as “rough”. “When I was 25 a friend of mine ended up getting into a fight at a bar and was killed.” He left soon after eventually settling in Edinburgh where he worked at the city’s Hard Rock Cafe as a waiter and later as a manager.

Jones tells me about the mental health crisis he suffered in his early 30s. “My girlfriend and I broke up and it kind of all came crashing down. At that point it sounds cliched but I decided I needed to find something to save me.”

He set his heart on becoming an artist and “begged” his way on to an art foundation course at Leith School of Art which he followed with a degree at the University of Edinburgh.

I look at life as pre-Beeple and post-Beeple – like the world thinks about before Jesus Christ and after. Beeple is kind of my Jesus

Things began to look up for Jones in 2012 when he had the idea of incorporating QR codes into his art painting the scannable barcodes in Mondrian-like colours on canvas. Scanning the paintings takes viewers through to an online gallery where anybody can upload their work. “People were laughing at me at the time” he says. While gallery audiences turned their noses up he gained a new following online one that would turn out to have deep pockets.

In 2019 Jones began working with animators to turn his paintings into short videos that he sold as NFTs. Among his most successful works is Bitcoin Angel an NFT based on Bernini’s baroque masterpiece The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa which he sold in 2020 for the equivalent of more than $3m (all of Jones’s NFTs are bought using cryptocurrency). In Bernini’s marble sculpture a nun has been stabbed in the heart by an angel with a spear. She leans backwards overcome by the sublime ecstasy of being penetrated by a heavenly body. When the arrow pierces the heart of Jones’s nun she bleeds bitcoin.

To sell Bitcoin Angel Jones used a website called Nifty Gateway one of a number of online auction sites designed for trading NFTs that are now flooded with aspiring crypto artists. I dedicated an afternoon to scrolling through the lots each one flashing and jiggling in the hope of attracting the attention of collectors. I saw gifs of muffins transforming into dogs spinning trainers sycophantic portraits of Elon Musk and an abundance of naked big-boobed cyborgs. The art critic Dean Kissick described the male-dominated NFT scene as “Etsy for guys” and on this evidence it’s easy to see why. Aside from the headline-grabbing sales Nifty Gateway provides a platform for aspirational entrepreneurs and hobbyists who practise their craft on computers rather than knotting macrame plant hangers.

While those – like Jones – who successfully rode the NFT wave were busy counting their crypto dollars over the past year the conventional art world has suffered a decline. During the pandemic with audiences unable to physically attend exhibitions and fairs art dealers have struggled to make online viewing rooms interesting or lucrative. As a consequence global sales of art fell by 22%. To rub salt in that wound millions of crypto dollars were exchanging hands for a natively digital art form. “The technology is designed against the existing art world” says Noah Davis a specialist at Christie’s New York. “It’s an art form that doesn’t need a gallery.”

It was Davis who helped to sell Beeple’s $69m NFT the first piece of crypto art ever listed by a major auction house. He views his own impact as pivotal: “I introduced NFTs to the Christie’s audience and thereby the world” he says. The artwork was sold during an online auction in March that took two weeks to close. Bidding opened at $100 and within an hour that figure had risen to $1m – the result of a vast number of bids all happening digitally. “I’ve never seen anything so spectacular. You can’t bid that quickly at auction unless you just shout out: ‘A million bucks’” Davis says “and that’s impossible to do online. So all that bidding had to happen in increments and manually.

What can a commercial gallery do for me? I sell an NFT and three minutes later I’ve got the money in my digital wallet

“I look at my life as pre-Beeple and post-Beeple” he adds. “The same way the world thinks about before Jesus Christ and after. Beeple is kind of my Jesus.”

In the months since Christie’s has continued to cash in on NFTs. In May it achieved $16.9m for nine pixellated cartoon characters from the CryptoPunks series early examples of NFT art that have become sought-after collectibles. Christie’s has also attempted to unite the crypto and modern art markets. This spring it hosted a sale of digital artworks made by Andy Warhol in the 1980s. The images which had been recovered from floppy disks and transformed into NFTs include drawings made on the artist’s Commodore Amiga computer of bananas flowers and of a Campbell’s soup can that alone sold for more than $1m.

In general the commercial gallery world has been understandably cagey about adopting technology designed to circumvent it. Behind the scenes however a number of galleries have attempted to woo Jones. He has declined their advances. “What can a commercial gallery do for me?” he asks. “Having a gallery exhibition before I worked a year creating paintings I paid for all the framing the overheads for the studio. I had the paintings delivered to the commercial gallery. I may or may not sell the gallery takes 45 to 55% commission and they might pay out a month six weeks two months later.” And now? “I sell something and three minutes later I’ve got the money in my digital wallet.”

At times the divide between the two art worlds seems more profound than a difference in business model: it’s an all-out culture clash. “Few of these cyber-millionaires could tell the back of a Rembrandt from the front” wrote art critic Waldemar Januszczak. “There is no challenge whatsoever in NFT art” conceptual art collector Pedro Barbosa told the New York Times arguing that the ideas behind NFTs are often derivative having “already been explored by artists like Josef Albers László Moholy-Nagy and Marcel Duchamp”. David Hockney branded NFTs “silly little things” for “crooks and swindlers” – a curious accusation from an artist happy to embrace and monetise novel digital technology. Since 2009 Hockney has been doing a roaring trade in souped-up iPhone and iPad drawings.

Jones tells me that the crypto faithful who like Hilton ardently believe that NFTs are the future of art now use the dusty epithet “the legacy art world” to refer to their physical rivals.

As a painter Jones is unusual among NFT artists. On occasion this has allowed him the opportunity to sell the original painting on which an NFT is based as well as the NFT. Pulling off this kind of double sale however must be handled carefully. Charging more for a painting than an NFT and thus valuing physical art more highly than digital art could provoke the ire of the crypto crowd. When Jones sold Bitcoin Bull to Rodriguez-Fraile he also sold the original painting to the second-place bidder. In order not to offend his fans he priced the painting at $55000 – $555.55 less than the NFT.

A handful of established contemporary artists notably those who have form when it comes to explicitly courting headlines and extreme wealth have tried their hand at making NFTs – most prominently Damien Hirst who released the project The Currency in July. Hirst put 10000 NFTs up for sale each corresponding to a unique spot painting for $2000 a piece. But there is a catch: after two months the collector must decide if they wish to keep the NFT or the physical art work. Whichever one they don’t choose will be destroyed forcing the owner to gamble on which version will be more valuable in the future.

The most shocking aspect of the NFT to the art intelligentsia is its brazen entanglement with finance. Trading art has always been a pastime of the wealthy. Much of what counts for art history consists of flattering portrayals of the rich and powerful and artists have long been expected to perform what Tom Wolfe called the Art Mating Ritual – attracting the interest of wealthy patrons and conservative institutions while simultaneously presenting as Bohemians and renegades. Yet with the NFT the distinction between art and asset seems to have disappeared. In place of the curated exhibition is the auction website; symbols of the market have seeped into the aesthetic language of the art itself. Prices not ideas dominate.

Despite the promise of “art for everyone” the final destination of the NFT might not actually be art. Art may simply be a useful way to advertise the possibilities of a new technology. “I’ve done everything from fashion fragrances to endorsements” Paris Hilton says adding that NFTs are another way for “fans to have a piece of me”. As well as working with the rapper Ice Cube Jones recently made an NFT for the whisky company Macallan to be auctioned alongside a very expensive cask of scotch. This it seems is a taste of where NFTs may be heading: not a radical new model for trading art but a digital marketing bauble.

Perhaps the most significant legacy of the NFT’s assault on the art market will be the questions it forces us to ask about the nature of art and what it is that we want from it. How should art be traded and viewed? Who gets to ascribe value to art? Is there a moral or aesthetic code by which artists are expected to work and who has elected themselves to define it? And why would anybody part with their money in exchange for a digital fart? Then there’s the biggest question: is there a meaningful difference between an artwork and an asset? The answer perhaps is not always – but if we want art to be more than a tool for prettifying finance and flogging merch then it’s an ideal worth holding on to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3MvYW5kcmV3LXdpbHNvbi1uZnRzLWFuZC1wbGF5LXRvLWVhcm4tYXJlLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtdGhlLWdhbWluZy1pbmR1c3RyedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andrew Wilson: NFTs and Play-To-Earn Are the Future of the Gaming Industry,"NFTs are becoming the mega assets to invest in currently. The chief executive officer of Electrical Art Andrew Wilson says that in addition to the popularity of NFTs play-to-earn platforms follow suit. Speaking at an earnings call Andrew noted that the gaming industry is changing in the above direction. He also pointed out however that the path is not yet clearly defined.

A Glimpse Into the Electrical Arts (EA)

EA is a public gaming company that was founded in 1982. Admittedly the association uses a pay-to-win strategy rather than the current play-to-earn. Electronic arts is widely known for licensing with legacy teams like FIFA and Madden.

The company has yet to join the Blockchain business. Currently EA thrives by using cards to place players into the most qualified teams. Together with its tradition The CEO hints at interest to join Blockchain technology.

Play-to-Earn NFT Games

If you wonder why playing to earn is termed promising well here comes your answer. Companies like Axie Infinity have shown the impact of play-to-earn games.

Axie Infinity is a Vietnamese video game developer famous for intense games when given a refined product. At Axie players complete specific tasks while competing alongside other players. While in this process the players are then endowed with digital assets which they can use to trade on crypto exchanges.

Additionally Kakashi Inu V2 a young company also leans towards indicating the strength of NFT play to earn games. The impact is so significant that the team recently announced that it would create an augmented reality game to utilize this opportunity fully.

Will Play-To-Earn Games Have an Opportunity?

As indicated by Andrew Wilson the company does not intend to shut down its traditional gaming techniques. He stated that the company is excelling and creating highly sustainable value. In this manner the organization may not need to close its games let alone go crypto.

However he also understands how imminent the move to join Blockchain is. Soon the CEO observed that the Nun Fungible Tokens might even overcome current market trends. EA will therefore need to adapt early to counter taking adamant measures in dire times.

An analyst of the gaming industry Piers Harding Rolls says that NFT and Blockchain games can ruin existing technologies. He therefore advises prudence to establish an excellent commercial practice where a company maintains its business despite a wave of ideological and popularity changes.

Concerns Towards NFT Based Games

Some of EA’s rivals are firmly against NFTs. These rivals have even banned crypto-based games on their sites stating that it is not suitable for gaming.

However companies like Electronic Arts understand how critical it is to safeguard one’s source even for the future. It is even more so that some gamers have reported that EA has added knowledge in NFT as an added advantage to joining the thriving team.

NFTs and Play-To-Earn Games are the Future

The gaming industry may be conflicting currently but subsequently the indecision will change. The value of NFTs in games will gradually increase to out shadow previous perspectives. For games to exist and thrive in the future gaming industries need to rethink and adapt.

I mean who would rather pay to win instead of playing to earn? Weal wants to thrive doing what we love doing. So to the companies go figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydWVhY2hpZXZlbWVudHMuY29tL240NzYzOC9maWZhLTIyLWZ1dC11bHRpbWF0ZS10ZWFtLWluLWZvcm1zLXNiYy1vYmplY3RpdmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA 22 Locker Room: What's new this week? (November 5th),"Team of the Week

Our Pick: Vinícius Júnior (85 — LW — Real Madrid)

SBCs

Objectives and Misc.

Welcome to the Locker Room. Here we can talk about all of FIFA 22 's Ultimate Team mode news once a week. That includes a list of the Team of the Week cards including our chosen pick as well as the newest SBCs and the objectives for the week.Well it's a really odd selection of cards this week even if the actual players who earned them really deserved it — Dušan Vlahović's hatty vs Juve anyone? Headlining this week is Marquinhos the PSG centre back with a nice 88-rated card. I have always struggled using him in FIFA because of his short stature but let us know if you'll be picking this up! Yannick Carrasco one of the most elegant-looking men in football has picked up an in form for his work on the left-wing. It will be a great cheap pick up for those of you that want a solid playmaker out wide and I think he would make a great LF in a 4-3-2-1. The Featured TOTW player for the week and thus getting that double bumped inform is Rangers RB Tavernier. The English nationality will help him slot into plenty of Premier League teams though with Reece James (look at his inform this week!) and Trent Alexander Arnold also dominating that RB slot in the EPL Tavernier is going to struggle to make a name for himself amongst FIFA teams.We didn't want to do this we like finding you good investment cards cheap deals or underrated gems. But Vini... oh Vini! With 98 pace some fairly solid shooting and fab dribbling this will be a great upgrade to slot in on your LW La Liga team. Now I've heard and seen with my own two eyes that the Ousmane Dembélé's 86-rated Rulebreaker card has a habit of being obscene. However with Vini's extra 10 pace over Dembélé and a little extra in the dribbling department in his in-game stats I would be considering grabbing the Real Madrid player. His 5* Skills and 4* weak foot are a great addition too though they are outmatched by Dembélé's 5* for both. Whichever one you go for though you are getting a solid La Liga LW for a few months.Quite the haul of SBC's this week! We have picked the currently available SBCs and priced them as per FUTbin 's amazing listings. Kevin-Prince Boateng has a Flackback CAM card for his new team Hertha Berlin. It looks like it costs around 40k and has some solid if unspectacular stats. It might be good to drop him into CM as a technician to help with build-up play. Mostly the value of this card is in whatever face the journeyman is pulling... hideous. PSG's Marco Verratti has an 89-rated Rulebreakers card in CM valued at around 130k. I think the numbers justify the price here with only his poor heading pace and miserable shooting stats letting him down. Like Boateng though if you use him in build-up play maybe as a free eight you'll find that he can carve up other teams. Now there is a Dante Rulebreakers card the CB from OGC Nice but you don't have long to nab his 130k rated card. If we are being honest and we always are at TA this card is bad. The value for money is non-existent and you can find literally just grab Marquinihos for a few more coins if you really need that Brazilian Ligue Un link. Don't waste your coins on him!The Silver Star this week is Josh Carvallo  an RB out of the A-League. Naturally you need to grab eight goals six assists and three wins in the Silver Lounge. There will be more Objective players out this weekend so keep an eye out! The first week of Rulebreaker cards hit packs over the last week and have just hopped out of them. You'll be able to find them all on the market. These purple numbers offer some swapped stats on a selection of players much like the Ultimate Scream cards of years prior. No live update means that you can be certain that these investments will drop in value with time so pick and choose carefully before splurging. That Erling Haaland though...

But what will you be grabbing this week? Any player taking your fancy? Agree with our Player Pick from the TOTW? Let us know in the comments!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LWVuZ2luZWVyLW15LXJldHJvLXR2LTU1MzIwNC5odG1s0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LWVuZ2luZWVyLW15LXJldHJvLXR2LTU1MzIwNC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Netflix Engineer's Love For '80s Birthed An Imitation Of Each Decade's TV Experience,"If you're a naturally nostalgic soul who grew up on ancient modes of entertainment like cable television this era-by-era portal created by Netflix engineer Joey Cato is for you. Starting from the '60s and running into the '00s each era's experience mimics the technological marvels of that time. Called ""My Retro TVs"" the virtual websites were created by Cato as a means to ""reclaim his youth"" he told us.

Each era displays big pop culture moments of that time period complemented by an equally convincing interface. For instance the tuners reminiscent of the earliest sets of television in 1960s are wonderfully mimicked on the website making the entire experience immersive.

That's not all for each era between 1960s and 2000s multiple genres of content is available to watch on the My Retro TVs website - ranging from cartoons comedy drama kids talk shows to even commercials! Essentially there's something for everyone who's seemingly tired of a remote-sized screen abyss in their pockets.

My60sTV / Joey Cato

If you were born before the '00s chances are you have experienced some form of television fatigue - from losing signal to endless repeats and the lack of flexibility. Every advertisement meant a pee break and every repeat telecast presented a chance to become a knowledge-master of that particular series.

Joey Cato

If music is what defined your childhood Joey Cato has put in extra work to imbibe classics from each era into his portal. Think it doesn't get better? Cato has news for you. Within each era's dedicated website there exist further demarcations based on each year which may help you narrow your preferences. While a search button feels missing it's simply to assist in making the experience more realistic.



My70sTV / Joey Cato

The inspiration behind My Retro TVs

We caught up with Joey Cato on the inspiration behind the creation of My Retro TVs. The first platform for the project focused on the '80s. ""I've always been deeply connected with the nostalgia from that time period"" he told us. Joey Cato also talked about the role played by his childhood and upbringing in creating the digital experience. ""I grew up poor in a small town so I always felt like I missed out on the full pop culture experiences then"" he said.

When Cato was working on My Retro TVs he was already knee-deep in other big projects like Electronic Arts' The Sims 4. ""[At this time] I realized that the Flash technology we were using to create our interfaces was starting to become obsolete so I thought it was a good time to freshen up my resume by learning modern web development"" he told Indiatimes over e-mail.

A series of his side projects manifested as My80sTv. ""The original web app became quickly popular which completely surprised me. It was pure joy hearing from folks around the world telling me how much the site connected them to their childhood."" This feedback inspired him to build era-based throwbacks ""by adding on more decades ('90s '70s '00s and most recently '60s).""

My80sTV / Joey Cato

Not much later after building My80sTV and My90sTV Joey Cato was being sought by Netflix for an interview where he currently works. At the world's favourite streaming portal Cato works with JavaScript to build their TVUI experience.

Additionally Netflix's future-ready streaming capabilities added to the nostalgia factor for Cato to pursue MyRetroTVs inspiring him to create a throwback experience of cable television. ""I think it may have been partly due to how content streaming’s increased popularity had displaced the traditional concept of “channel-clicking/surfing”.""

A compelling era-by-era recreation of pop culture

With MyRetroTVs Cato was simply trying to ""give users the ability to access those older forms of discovery and interaction"" with a bias for the '80s.

“I guess I’ve been digitizing for my entire career 20 years” said Michael Montello senior vice president of R&D technology at GlaxoSmithKline. “I remember the first data warehouse I implemented in discovery . . . And here we are still talking about digital transformation.”

Montello was reminiscing at the Bio-IT World Conference in September where he discussed the past 3 years of GSK’s digitization initiative. Peers from Pfizer Roche and Eli Lilly and Company joined him describing similar programs at their firms in drug discovery data management.

Their discussion had a familiar ring to it: break down function silos establish central data management develop standard terminologies. In fact a regular conference attendee may well have shared Montello’s observation: “Here we are again.”

But there is no question that equipping labs with information technology is a rapidly changing endeavor given the now-ubiquitous use of cloud computing and the soon-to-be ubiquitous deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning. And the velocity of change in drug discovery IT is increased by something advancing even more rapidly—science.

The future comes fast in this game. Liran Zvibel CEO WekaIO

New technologies such as gene editing and genomics place drug discovery on the front line of a transformation in data management. As laboratories produce petabytes of data responsibility for managing and curating information in the hunt for new drugs is increasingly shifting from centralized IT departments to research teams at the bench. It’s a big change for both the scientist and the IT department.

“It is absolutely clear that the rate of scientific innovation far outstrips the speed of IT innovation. It also moves faster than I an IT person can build a storage system or build an analytical environment or build a database” says Chris Dagdigian senior director of BioTeam a life sciences IT consultancy.

Scientists in the lab have inevitably become directly involved with IT system development assuming responsibilities traditionally housed in corporate IT departments Dagdigian says. In turn the traditionally centralized laboratory data management infrastructure has morphed into bench-level IT shared by drug researchers working with data scientists and software engineers.

“The message in recent years is that the way we use and access data is very nuanced and very fluid and not amenable to simple rules-based decisions that the IT department can simply deploy” Dagdigian says. “There are certain things when it comes to scientific data that are wildly inappropriate for IT to own and control.”

Dagdigian advocates technology that allows scientists to “self-service”: accessing using and filing data on their own. “On the flip side I don’t want scientists to become IT experts just to do their job.” The IT department isn’t going to fold its tents.

Industry watchers agree that a transition is underway that can’t simply be characterized as a dispersion of centralized IT. And the approaches taken by large drug companies start-ups and academic research labs are bound to differ according to the amount of IT infrastructure already in place. But labs in all segments of research are forming multidisciplinary teams to develop data management systems that afford researchers far greater agency than ever before.

Fast action

The rate of change is the most challenging aspect of implementing data management IT at Pfizer according to Holly Soares a molecular scientist and head of precision medicine at the large drug company. “When we get offered new systems more rapidly and with increasing technological complexity it is sometimes hard to adapt and be nimble.” Deploying new technologies which once occurred over yearslong periods now has to be done in months—or even days—as the company advances research on antivirals and vaccines she says.

Pfizer’s IT management is also evolving. “We are seeing data scientists now embedded with the research teams” Soares says noting that the disciplines are learning from each other. Research scientists are becoming more involved in curating data and data scientists are picking up on the expertise of research scientists which helps them to apply IT tools in the lab more effectively. The mutual learning is prevalent in genomics research she says where IT is central to identifying drug targets and understanding target differentiation. “The amount of data can be in the terabyte territory.”

Managing the data has also become a “team sport” at Lilly says Ramesh Durvasula the firm’s vice president for research IT. Subject-matter experts IT technicians and data scientists are huddling at the lab bench he says.

Durvasula notes that chemists and biologists coming intothe lab in recent years are well prepared for interdisciplinary research. “There are a lot more PhDs coming out of the sciences who are a lot more software and computational savvy than they were decades ago” he says. “We need to repurpose many of our systems to empower them to leverage all the skills they bring to bear rather than assuming they have the skills of years ago where they were strictly bench scientists.”

The challenge in equipping multidisciplinary teams centers on differences between the disciplines. “We need to understand that the consumption of data and leveraging of models by a bench scientist is very different from the consumption of data and leveraging of models by a pure data scientist” Durvasula says.

Standardization of data is another uphill climb. “With the advancement of scientific instrumentation the nature of the data being collected is outpacing the speed at which we can standardize” he says.

Durvasula says research teams are working through the obstacles however focusing on computational models and turning the vice of hoarding data into a virtue. “It is not that the scientists need us to hoard the data; the models need us to hoard the data” he says. The computational models established for research are emerging as a competitive distinction in laboratories according to Durvasula. “We don’t talk about killer apps anymore” he says. “What we are more interested in is killer data sets.”

Tom Plasterer AstraZeneca’s senior director for strategy and collaborations in oncology translational medicine agrees that standardization continues to vex the field but says that the pharmaceutical industry has made headway with the help of data standard repositories such as the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies’ BioPortal.

Drug industry–led efforts like the Allotrope Foundation have advanced common terms for data management Plasterer says. Most recently the FAIR principles—guidelines for ensuring data in storage are findable accessible interoperable and reusable—have been adopted by drug companies including AstraZeneca and Pfizer.

Lately Plasterer’s organization is building data modeling for oncology research. The data come from the bench.

“We have a ton of really smart scientists” Plasterer says. “They’re reading papers all the time and it’s all in their heads. And you need to pull it out and put it in a model that a computer can use. That is a lot of what I do. Taking stuff I pull out of people’s heads and putting that data in the model.”

Smaller companies especially research-intensive biotechs that launched in a world of cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) can address the growing agency of the scientist without having to accommodate entrenched IT systems and management.

Recursion a biotech company that outsources its wet chemistry puts a lot of stock in its ability to craft data management technology that fits specific projects in individual labs. Mason Victors is the chief product officer for the 8-year-old firm. The word product in his title refers not to drugs but rather to software and protocols that make up the company’s data management system.

Victors says the rise of multidisciplinary teams in drug research indicates that “the status quo is not very good—not for companies living in a digital era. Not for 21st-century biotechnology companies.”

With a background in applied mathematics data science and machine learning Victors is also critical of how scientists have handled data in the lab. “Scientists want to run an experiment because they are trying to answer a very specific question” he says. “When they get the answer they want to stop messing with the data.” Raw data end up not being captured and curated in any repository where it can be accessed later by other researchers.

Recursion has designed a cloud-based storage system to address this problem. “The majority of Recursion’s data is in high-content fluorescent microscopy imaging” he says. “We run about 1.7 million experimental wells every week through our fluorescent microscopy platform and those images as they get captured off the microscopes automatically get synced up to Google Cloud.”

There the images are turned into mathematical representations that define insights on the data and can be delivered to users on request at any time Victors says.

New tools for the bench

Vendor-supplied data management software is also moving into discovery labs. Benchling a start-up crafting SaaS applications for drug discovery has its eye on how scientists work and their preferences in IT tools according to Ashu Singhal president and cofounder of the company which launched 9 years ago.

Singhal points to the “consumerization” of IT epitomized by the iPhone as well as the steady movement of data management systems to the cloud. “I think we are seeing the emergence of full SaaS platforms that obviate the LIMS” Singhal says referring to traditional central laboratory information management systems.

Benchling develops applications for specific areas of research such as genomics or gene editing putting software configuration in the user’s hands Singhal says. “That means that they can adjust how the software is set up and how it works” he says. “It’s software compatible with the speed at which R&D is currently moving.”

Still the company relies on a high level of standardization. “I think 80% of what users need from us comes out of the box” Singhal says.

Benchling claims its tools are used by 200000 scientists at 600 companies ranging from small biotechs building IT from the ground up to large industrial and institutional research organizations with well-established data management systems.

New data storage and search options are also emerging for the bench scientist. WekaIO is one of several new companies with products designed for shared storage of large volumes of complex life sciences data. The company offers cloud-based data storage with an on-premises option in partnership with hardware suppliers including Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Hitachi Vantara. Using the firm’s WekaFS research departments can scale storage beyond the dozens of petabytes that currently define the high end in drug discovery labs according to CEO Liran Zvibel.

In addition to high volume WekaFS operates at high speed. Any scientific tool can access a single data source whereas most traditional systems store data redundantly in areas assigned to particular projects or kinds of research. Access to a single source also accommodates project changes without having to adjust dedicated data sourcing. “The future comes fast in this game” Zvibel says. “One of our strongest abilities is flexibility.”

New software for data search has also debuted. Seven-year-old Genomenon focuses on genomics research which has experienced explosive growth in data generation. The company uses artificial intelligence to implement a genomics search engine for clinical research and a genomics database called Genomic Landscapes for drug discovery says CEO Mike Kline.

“We ID any variant ever published in association with a disease. We curate those and provide an interpretation with the scientific evidence that goes with it” Kline says describing Genomic Landscapes.

The center can hold

New technology is not obviating the workhorse LIMS and similar centralized lab IT LIMS proponents say. In fact Robert Voelkner vice president of sales and marketing at the LIMS supplier LabVantage Solutions notes that the key goals in data management may actually strengthen the position of LIMS in drug discovery. Researchers need to consolidate harmonize and standardize data core competencies of a traditional LIMS. “Companies don’t want bespoke IT systems” Voelkner says.

Voelkner says he has seen LIMS roll with massive changes in his nearly 40 years implementing the systems in drug discovery. “In the early days you had IT organizations that were responsible for everything IT related. The lab was only one of them” he says. The same management division was also in charge of human resources computing email and personal computers. Lab ­research IT is now a distinct entity.

“The CIO-level person still has strategic vision looking to deploy standards and consolidate platforms” Voelkner says referring to the chief information officer. “But the people who are running the day-to-day IT operations are members of the lab organization now.”

IT systems have evolved as well to accommodate greater autonomy in developing new tools. LabVantage recently introduced a version of its LabVantage Analytics system that incorporates machine-leaning algorithms for the creation of data sets for use by researchers.

Ned Haubein LIMS senior application manager at Penn Medicine University of Pennsylvania Health System says his group is working to accommodate data-savvy scientists with a centralized storage architecture allowing data curation and management in the lab.

That is a lot of what I do. Taking stuff I pull out of people’s heads and putting that data in the model. Tom Plasterer senior director for strategy and collaborations in oncology translational medicine AstraZeneca

“The shift to doing more analysis in individual labs is growing” he says. “You are getting people who have more of the skills necessary to do that work—people with statistical backgrounds.” Haubein’s department is focused on making data accessible to multiple unrelated laboratories from the central repository.

“Part of the role we play is to define how researchers name data. We play the role of data stewards” he says. “It’s important that most of the people on our LIMS team have a background that crosses science and technology. It allows us to talk to the labs in their language.” Haubein has a PhD in chemical engineering.

The LIMS system is updated with advanced configurations that allow customization for laboratory-level employees Haubein says. The trend of researchers taking more control of their IT does not pose an existential threat to large data storage systems he argues.

The largest of drug companies are also working toward a balance of traditional and emerging data management techniques that supports the needs of multidisciplinary drug discovery teams. Montello speaking at the conference in Boston described how GSK’s digital transformation program started small in one research area and went large across all IT development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL25vdi8wNy9wYXVsLWhheWxleS1ndWVzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HIGH PROFILE: Paul Hayley Guess spreads Christmas cheer from Des Arc warehouse,"You might not expect to find 60000 square feet of holiday wonder in a Des Arc warehouse or consider a pilgrimage to the Prairie County seat a can't-miss Christmas tradition. But five days a week through Dec. 5 hundreds of people will visit a former Van Heusen shirt factory to see what holiday magic Paul Guess has in store for them this year.

Guess 50 has expressive eyebrows an easy smile and a firm handshake. He's the hometown mastermind behind Guess & Co.'s annual Christmas at the Warehouse Sale a grand-scale holiday shopping experience grown over the past six years largely by word of mouth. He's also the owner of LUX Fragrances -- premium scented candles hand-poured at his Des Arc factory -- and his own Deck the Halls Y'all brand of seasonal merchandise shipped around the country. New this year as an umbrella over it all is Paul Guess Live! an online shopping experience broadcast through Facebook and paulguesslive.com.

He estimates 22000 people the most ever will come to the warehouse this season in a town with a population of roughly 1700. Even with last year's covid-19 precautions and entrance by appointment only more than 18000 shoppers showed up. To reach shoppers not comfortable leaving their homes Guess got on Facebook and started livestreaming his merchandise. Sales were so robust they sprouted the idea for Paul Guess Live! as a way to take this Des Arc experience to people anywhere in the world.

MOVING PEOPLE NOT PRODUCTS

Guess is the youngest of four in a family that genuinely enjoys one another's company. For 36 years his parents Ann and Donald ran the local Dairy Freeze drive-in; their business acumen and work ethic put all four kids through college. They still gather Sundays after church to share a family meal and work closely during the week.

Guess says his most vivid Christmas memories aren't of presents but of his family's holiday traditions and the feeling of love and trust that permeated everything. It's those feelings he's chasing in his businesses and that form the core of his character.

Of all the adjectives used to describe Guess ""reserved"" has likely never been among them. He emotes like a champion. He connects warmly with others makes jokes at his own expense uses exclamation points like he bought them wholesale and gets misty-eyed talking about the things that matter most to him. He heads businesses that delight people and that fact brings him endless delight.

""From a business perspective I don't focus on moving product but on creating the full sensory experience"" he says. ""When people pull up in small-town Arkansas in front of this building they think 'What am I doing here where am I?' But as soon as we open those doors they know they've arrived at the North Pole.""

THE FULL SENSORY EXPERIENCE

Inside the warehouse is a larger-than-life shopping spectacle. Jingle bells three feet in circumference. Towering Christmas trees dressed in intricate splendor. Full-size glitter reindeer. Garlands of faux evergreen boughs interwoven with replica clove-studded oranges. Whimsical moldable elf dolls and Whoville-esque Christmas tree sculptures. A holiday tablescape graces a dining set that's also for sale.

The show floor flows from rustic farmhouse holiday decor in one corner to translucent ornaments glistening like ice crystals in another. Artificial snow floats through the air in one section; at a different spot shoppers can pose for photos inside an inflated snow globe. An area emanating scents of the season showcases LUX candles. And because 75% of the merchandise was designed and manufactured by Guess' companies it's sold at wholesale prices.

One new addition takes center stage literally. In the middle of the warehouse a large television set has been constructed. From 6-7 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays a live audience watches Guess share his products seasonal recipes and decorating tips in a beautiful white and lapis-blue kitchen. Mobile users can buy the specials available only during the show from their devices as it airs. ""The technology is cutting-edge and it's a worldwide show but we're still country"" Guess says. ""The set may look New York but in the studio we're straight up Des Arc. I think that's the great dichotomy of it.""

DES ARC DREAMING

Guess' focus has landed where it started: on his hometown. He dreams of making his Des Arc sale the size of the famous holiday market in Canton Texas to help more local businesses thrive.

Tyler Cox is vice president at Farmers & Merchants Bank in Des Arc and Hazen. He has been Guess' lender since the beginning and knows what drives him. ""Everything Paul does he does for this community and the people he employs"" he says. ""He doesn't care anything about the money. As his banker I can tell you he gives away more than he keeps for himself just because he loves this town.""

Cox says Guess has received offers for free warehousing in neighboring areas but has no interest in moving his business. ""Paul wants to keep employment here"" Cox says. ""He could save a lot on the labor side by outsourcing but he wants to care for his people. During the holidays he hires just about every high school kid around here to give them some experience.""

""I believe in them"" Guess says of the students. ""I want them to understand yes you're in a small town but you can do great things. You can be who you choose to be. I'm straight outta Des Arc y'all! And I'm not ashamed in the least.""

Working at the Dairy Freeze was his first job as well as his first job out of college. He graduated from Des Arc High in 1989 and attended the University of Arkansas Fayetteville. Four years later he headed home to put his bachelor's in small business management to use. He helped manage the dairy bar for almost seven years then started feeling the itch to try something new. ""I felt called to do something bigger in the world"" he says. ""I wanted to spread my wings.""

""LILLY RED""

His wings took him across the United States working for Eli Lilly & Co for almost 14 years. He moved seven times. Living alone in major cities away from his everyone-knows-everyone hometown was a challenge but Guess loved the company and ascended into upper middle management. ""It's a great company that helped me so much"" he says. ""To this day I bleed Lilly red!""

While at Lilly Guess in 2009 was accepted into Harvard Business School's general management program for executive education. Out of 125 students he was one of only 13 Americans. He says working closely with so many non-Americans changed his life.

""I think I'm this big pharmaceutical executive whatever"" Paul says with an eye roll toward his past self. ""Then the first day they say to us 'Unless you're here to change the world this program is not for you.' And I thought 'Where's the door? I'm in the wrong place!' Only to realize four or five months later that it was the exact right place; that program is what piqued my interest in international business.""

His last position at Eli Lilly was based in Little Rock. In 2013 when the company asked Guess to move again he turned it down; he was enjoying being in his young nephews' and niece's lives. ""There's nothing more important to me than family"" he says eyes shining as his voice catches. ""And I knew I'd been missing out."" He says a senior vice president told him ""Paul go back home and have the impact on your hometown that we know you're capable of making.""

So he did.

GUESS & CO. AND DECK THE HALLS Y'ALL

Back in 2008 Guess had on a whim opened a pop-up Christmas store in Searcy in an old pizza joint a fun venture outside the world of pharma. On leaving Eli Lilly in 2013 his brother suggested Paul start a holiday import and design business. Knowing nothing about either area Guess taught himself often studying bills of lading into the wee hours to learn where and how different items were made. He began cold-calling manufacturers that impressed him. ""I knew nothing!"" he laughs. ""And they didn't speak English but they spoke enough to tell me 'You email.'""

Guess founded Guess & Co. and Deck the Halls Y'all traveling to dozens of factories across the globe and the states mostly small family businesses. ""You want to know who you're working with what their facility is like and the type of people they are"" he says. ""We want a lasting relationship.""

Now he can tell you by name who made almost every item he sells. Most are crafted by hand. The jingle bells are welded by a family in northern China. A Deck the Halls Y'all collection is designed by a Conway artist on staff Sarah Nabholz. He points out beautiful wooden trays made in Bentonville.

Also in 2013 a retiring Estee Lauder executive he'd known for years asked him to buy her candle business. ""I told her no"" Guess says. ""I said 'That's too much! I can only do one thing at a time! I have a tiny brain!'"" He changed his mind though once he realized he could move the factory from Marble Falls Texas back home to Des Arc.

LUX Fragrances has grown five times larger since then. When Guess bought the company workers were pouring candles by the order. Now LUX produces 5000 candles per day each wick still meticulously trimmed with scissors. LUX products are carried by Neiman Marcus and other premium retailers.

Locally Guess sold candles from the factory lobby before moving the holiday sales into a tent in its parking lot to accommodate demand. Each year he'd only announce the sale on his personal Facebook profile. But each year long lines would show up often buying his candles and decor right off the trucks. Needing more space he bought the derelict shirt factory. The Christmas at the Warehouse tradition was born.

Each season kicks off with a series of VIP preview parties to benefit a project or nonprofit. Cox says the first year the profits bought 300 new computers for Des Arc schools. This year's beneficiary -- from the sales of 1800 VIP tickets -- is the Miss Arkansas Scholarship Fund. Guess says he chose the scholarships because he's a deep believer in getting more women into leadership positions.

Dennis Horn of Little Rock is president of the Miss Arkansas board and Guess' longtime friend. He says Guess has for years supported the organization with in-kind donations but this year is one of the biggest scholarship sponsors.

""Paul's always been big on empowering women through our pageant but also the women he employs"" Horn says. ""Now he's gotten to a point in his career where he's giving back not only to his local community but to the state of Arkansas through these cash scholarships.

""He's crazy talented more than he even knows"" Horn continues. ""I think he can do anything and he just continues to grow.""

HUMAN CONNECTION

Guess' success is built on human connection. As he goes through his businesses he warmly greets employees by name receiving big smiles in return. He gets up at 4:30 a.m. every day of the year to maintain relationships with his overseas partners. And he earns their loyalty.

Marvin Achoy an illustrator based in Manila Philippines works for Guess full time. ""When I hired Marvin I made a promise to him that his children would be able to attend university"" Guess says. He shares a photo Achoy sent him. In it small legs are visible sitting in their father's lap as he holds up a tablet playing one of Guess & Co.'s Facebook Live videos. ""They were so proud to see their father's work being shown in the U.S."" Guess says. ""That means something to me.""

Guess sums his endeavors up waving an arm wide to encompass the showroom and all his team members. ""We make wonder right here in Des Arc"" he says. ""And in doing that we've made some of the best friends in the world.""

Over the last few years artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly entrenched in our society. From health care to social media to banking virtually no areas of our lives is untouched by AI. As can be expected AI is also coming to the commercial refrigeration market albeit a little more slowly than in other industries.

One reason why it is more difficult to implement AI in commercial refrigeration is that many food retailers already have some type of control system in place. The numerous vendors in that space all collect and process data differently so it would be challenging to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data. Not to mention that many of these systems are proprietary and vendors may not be willing to share their data with others.

Still manufacturers are up to the challenge and many are already developing AI-enabled controls and equipment that could result in numerous benefits for food retailers and contractors alike.

Michael Kellerman

Director of electronic controllers and service business development Danfoss The most innovative or exciting AI case may not be the most practical for a food retailer.

Current State

Unlike other markets — including the consumer product industry — AI in the commercial refrigeration industry is still in its infancy said Michael Kellerman director of electronic controllers and service business development at Danfoss. The trajectory is starting to change though and the pace of AI development in commercial refrigeration is beginning to accelerate.

“Most manufacturers are advancing their equipment control intelligence but still defining how to leverage AI to provide value for their own business and for their customers” he said. “Fundamentally we are talking about gathering data from the equipment as well as external data sources artificially analyzing that data and then commanding the equipment to behave in a certain way.”

Finding that value for customers can be a challenge as the most innovative or exciting AI case might not be the most practical for a food retailer said Kellerman. Exchanging data is also continually evolving and manufacturers have to decide what to do with all the data collected from building management systems the cloud and other equipment and sensors.

Data management is an issue said Amrit Robbins CEO and cofounder of Axiom Cloud a software company that offers cloud-based analytics and AI refrigeration apps. In fact he noted that one of the biggest barriers facing AI in the commercial refrigeration industry is just getting all of the data in a format and location where it can be acted upon.

“For decades commercial refrigeration systems have been generating tons of data from thousands of sensors which is used only for real-time operation and threshold alarming before simply being discarded without ever leaving the facility” he said. “Because AI is already so widespread across adjacent industries we believe it will only be a couple more years before we start seeing widespread use of AI in commercial refrigeration.”

Another reason that cloud analytics and AI haven’t caught on in commercial refrigeration despite being proven technologies is that some traditional technology companies may not understand the unique needs and constraints of the customers in this space said Robbins. It has also historically been difficult to liberate the data locked in refrigeration controllers so that it can be used in cloud-based models.

While manufacturers recognize the potential of AI to deliver value in commercial refrigeration food retailers and their servicing teams still have questions about AI’s role in their operations and are often hesitant to adopt it said Charles Larkin director of data and analytics digital and connected technologies at Emerson Commercial and Residential Solutions. Proving the value of AI across a wide range of food retail applications will be necessary in order to remove these doubts.

“Many large food retail operations are already using AI in customer-focused areas of their businesses and have data science teams dedicated to personalizing their consumer loyalty programs” he said. “However very few have the refrigeration domain expertise or experience applying AI to critical facility systems which can be significantly more complex and require a completely different knowledge base. At Emerson one of the most important jobs we have is to provide this expertise and help demonstrate AI’s potential value to our customers.”

To that end Emerson is engaging some interested customers in short-term proof-of-concept trial periods where the company demonstrates how its solution integrates with the operation and delivers the potential for long-term continuous performance improvements. Once customers see for themselves how it works — where they’re making immediate gains and realize how quickly it offers a return on investment (ROI) — they’re much more interested in exploring a longer-term engagement said Larkin.

Another reason for the slow uptake of AI is that commercial refrigeration manufacturing is largely fragmented and comprised mainly of small- and medium-sized family-owned companies said Dr. Krishna Vedala IoT systems engineer at Minus Forty a refrigeration equipment manufacturer. Many of these manufacturers lack the knowledge resources and IoT expertise to develop such complex systems.

“IoT systems development is a long process and typically quite expensive” he said. “Additionally such systems require ongoing monitoring continual bug and glitch fixing and updates and enhancements as this technology is evolving rapidly. We expect within the next five years all major players on the market will have some form of IoT systems with varying degrees of sophistication.”

On the Horizon

Vedala noted that AI and machine learning (ML) can be generally split into two categories: descriptive analytics and predictive/adaptive analytics. OEMs and users of large refrigeration systems have primarily adopted descriptive analytics through their control and monitoring systems as part of their operations.

“In terms of true AI and ML adoption and implementation through predictive and adaptive methods and analytics the whole refrigeration industry seems to be behind the trend” he said. “OEMs need to conduct better and comprehensive researches on actionable insights that come from AI/ML in the refrigeration industry and communicate such benefits to their customers.”

As for applying AI to commercial refrigeration systems this can be broken down to three levels said Kellerman. The first level is between the equipment and the retail customer; for example when sensors detect customers approaching. The second level is between the equipment and the grocery store or restaurant where the equipment is intelligently communicating with inputs via a BMS.

“The third level would be the cloud and external inputs via the internet such as receiving equipment commands and information from a cloud platform or inputs like weather and traffic data electric utility signals and store POS data” he said. “All of these inputs could come together to better control how the equipment operates.”

Ultimately the core of AI technology will reside in the system control devices which are typically incorporated into the equipment itself said Larkin. By capturing data from sensors modern equipment controls can perform a variety of key system optimization functions from system fault protection and diagnostics to performance management and event scheduling.

“It’s important to understand that in many cases we can enable these capabilities without having to perform a significant retrofit” he said. “Many of our existing customers already have a data-rich infrastructure — including sensors controls and modems — that we can tap into and begin delivering ML insights. In some cases we recommend adding sensors but that is relatively inexpensive compared to a full retrofit solution.”

Benefits

As for the advantages that AI offers not only does it deliver potential reliability and longevity benefits to commercial refrigeration equipment it also addresses a diverse range of concerns for store operators and contractors alike said Larkin.

“For operators we’re building data models based on their unique requirements — such as case types and perishable food categories — to help them optimize food quality and food safety and reduce waste” he said. “We’re also developing ML algorithms to detect asset health or condition issues; these allow retailers and their contractors to begin implementing more predictive maintenance programs. This will help to reduce energy costs by keeping assets running in optimum condition.”

Reducing energy costs is extremely important said Robbins so for an energy manager the main benefits of AI will be reducing energy consumption with more intelligent operation; reducing expensive peak demand spikes by predictively shifting refrigeration loads in time; and unlocking the hidden flexibility of low-temperature systems to earn money from demand response programs.

“For facilities managers the main benefits of AI will likely be reducing the headaches of high temperature alarms and unplanned outages; saving money on monthly maintenance bills; or substantially reducing refrigerant leak rates without installing more PPM sensors” he said. “For contractors AI can be used to provide higher levels of service through root cause analysis of issues in real-time intelligent technician dispatching and data validation that shows whether an issue was fixed correctly the first time around.”

Energy savings increasing the longevity of the equipment and minimizing downtime and repair costs are all significant benefits of AI said Kellerman. “Another benefit will be a better experience with the retail customer whether it is interactive marketing or more innovative presentation of high-quality food products.”

In addition to the benefits mentioned above AI provides the missing tool required to improve efficiencies throughout the manufacturing process said Vedala.

“The insights generated from AI can be utilized to optimize the efficiencies in procurement of raw materials distribution of labor targeted marketing and sales strategies” he said. “The cost involved in maintaining such a valuable resource is quite minimal when compared to the costs incurred through the industry. It promotes collaborations with sharing of knowledge and information and providing holistic solutions in micro market and vending industries. There is no doubt that AI will bring significant benefits to the commercial refrigeration industry.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFuZGFyZC5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC90b3R0ZW5oYW0teGktdnMtZXZlcnRvbi1jb25maXJtZWQtbGluZXVwLXRlYW0tbmV3cy1hbnRvbmlvLWNvbnRlLWluanVyeS1sYXRlc3QtcHJlbWllci1sZWFndWUtdG9kYXktYjk2NDYzMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tottenham XI vs Everton: Starting lineup confirmed team news for Premier League,Oliver Skipp and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg are again preferred as the midfield two with Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso both left on the bench.,,,,,,,,,

He wants to know who’s working on it.

“It doesn’t pass the eye test” he scoffs: In a city whose non-Hispanic white population has dwindled to 45 percent it’s hard to see Black and brown faces on the site.

He has more than his eyesight to go by. In 2018 Mayor Martin J. Walsh — now President Biden's labor secretary — appointed Mr. Watson to lead the Boston Employment Commission the body created to monitor compliance with the Boston Residents Jobs Policy. The policy mandates giving a minimum share of work to city residents women and people of color on large private construction projects and those that are publicly funded.

The latest version of the ordinance from 2017 requires that Asian Black and Latino workers get at least 40 percent of the work hours on sanctioned projects to better reflect the city’s demographics. (It also mandates that 51 percent of the hours go to city residents and 12 percent to women.) Mr. Watson complains that while many projects fail to meet the benchmarks nobody is penalized.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact Welltower posted the strongest sequential revenue growth in the company’s history last quarter with rate and occupancy increases resulting in a 3.5% rise in same-store topline revenue.

“Despite mediocre bottom-line results we cannot be happier with the overall results of the quarter” CEO Shankh Mitra said Friday on the Toledo Ohio-based company’s Q3 2021 earnings call.

Looking ahead Mitra is even more bullish seeing signs that labor challenges are easing and the overall operating environment is improving which bodes well for the REIT’s longer-term financial performance. Welltower plans to achieve additional gains through an effort led by recently named COO John Burkart to “modernize” operations.

“It is my firm belief that our margin will be higher than the pre-Covid margin on a stabilized basis” Mitra said referring to Welltower’s senior housing operating partners.

However Mitra also cautioned that senior living operators across the industry continue to face a difficult and uncertain operating environment and while strong operators have opportunities to expand with partners like Welltower weaker businesses could fail.

Welltower’s leaders also are excited about maximizing the upside of new investments including four senior living portfolios that the company recently acquired for $1.3 billion. The REIT has a strong pipeline of additional senior housing opportunities and Mitra foresees that the current aggressive investment period will last even longer than he initially anticipated.

Welltower already is the largest senior housing owner in the United States with more than 780 properties in its senior housing operating (SHO) portfolio and about 350 in its triple-net portfolio.

Expense and revenue tug-of-war

The senior living expense stack was hit by “a perfect storm” in Q3 Mitra said on Friday’s call.

The “confluence of extraordinary costs” included rising expenses in labor insurance utility repair and maintenance and other areas he said.

Labor headwinds have been particularly forceful across the U.S. economy as workers left their jobs in droves over the summer while wages have been spiking and labor unrest has been building.

Within senior living additional labor complications arose. As the delta variant caused a surge in Covid-19 infections outside of senior living communities workers more frequently called in sick — either because they tested positive or out of caution if they were even mildly ill Mitra said. And senior living staff were logging more paid time off than usual eager to take advantage of easing travel restrictions after more than a year of exhausting work.

Consequently many senior living providers turned to agency labor which costs two to three times as much Mitra noted.

“We have seen some operators where contract labor cost has gone up 10x in six months” he said.

The rise in contract labor resulted in a $9 million SHO impact in the quarter Welltower noted in its earnings release. The SHO margin dropped 50 basis points sequentially to 21%.

But while expenses were a severe drag topline performance was strong thanks to the “dual benefit” of occupancy and rate growth Mitra said.

SHO same-store revenue increased 3.5% sequentially; and for the U.S. and U.K. portfolios year-over-year revenue growth turned positive for the first time since the pandemic started.

In the U.S. SHO portfolio occupancy growth was “solid” increasing 260 basis points sequentially BMO Capital Markets analysts noted. Overall SHO portfolio spot occupancy increased about 210 basis points sequentially to 76.7%.

Consumers recognized that high resident and staff vaccination rates made senior living communities safe havens driving demand even in the midst of the delta surge Mitra said.

Source: https://welltower.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21-Business-Update-vFINAL.pdf

Furthermore the rise in single-family home values and the strong performance of the stock market are providing older adults with the purchasing power for a senior living move even in the midst of an inflationary environment. And in light of the pandemic consumers also are more focused on the quality of care and services and shopping less on price Mitra said.

Welltower’s senior living operators are therefore aggressively increasing rates. They are in the process of enacting annual bumps for in-place residents but they are also touting the strength of their service offerings to drive rates for new residents and the “street” rate is generally moving up 1.5x to 2x faster than the “renewal” rate Mitra said.

The full benefit of rate increases has not yet been realized as the renewal rates typically take effect after the first of the year. So Welltower’s leaders are anticipating further momentum in the first quarter of 2022.

Storm gives way to green shoots

Mitra and other Welltower execs are not only optimistic about rate growth but are hopeful that the labor crunch is easing as enhanced unemployment benefits have been phased out the latest Covid-19 surge is dissipating and in-person school has resumed.

“Although I expect we will still see some continued pressure for several months I’m hearing green shoots as our operators are making comments such as ‘the peak labor challenge has passed’ or ‘we’ve seen a substantial pickup in applications’ or ‘new hires outnumber the employees leaving 2.5 to one’ and even ‘we’re currently fully staffed at almost all of our communities’” Burkart said.

Demand also remains “unprecedented” judging by October and early November sales trends.

“We have never seen this kind of momentum that’s all I’m willing to say” Mitra commented.

Mitra and Burkart are planning to build on these tailwinds by pursuing operational innovations. Burkart joined Welltower as COO in June 2021 coming from multifamily REIT Essex Property Trust (NYSE: ESS).

“While the focus on care has been and continues to be very high I believe that similar to the multifamily industry 20 to 30 years ago there [is] an opportunity to modernize our seniors housing business and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations” he said.

Though tight-lipped about his plans he identified targeted community renovations digital transformation and revenue management as areas of focus.

As one example he described leveraging Welltower’s data analytics to evaluate how a market has priced certain types of units over time. Applying this approach to one highrise property revealed “substantial variations in demand versus pricing” that is leading Welltower to change prices on certain units by as much as $1000 a month.

While encouraged by the appearance of green shoots Mitra also stressed that “we don’t know what is going to happen in the holiday season” with regard to labor and the overall operating environment remains taxing.

As a result he anticipates further industry consolidation of operators as winners are sorted from losers. Welltower expects to keep diversifying its roster of operators and expanding its relationships with “winners.” As an example Mitra cited StoryPoint.

Following the pre-pandemic disposition of 13 buildings at “an incredible price” Welltower counted only two StoryPoint communities in its portfolio. Over the last 18 months that number has grown to 50-plus communities.

“The market share of great operators is changing” Mitra said.

Torrid dealmaking pace continues

In conjunction with its earnings release Welltower announced acquisitions of four senior living portfolios representing a pro rata investment of $1.3 billion. These are just the latest transactions in a remarkably acquisitive period for the REIT.

With marquee deals such as the $1.6 billion purchase of 86 Atria Senior Living/Holiday Retirement properties Welltower has completed $5.6 billion in gross investments since October 2020.

Mitra elaborated on some of the latest senior housing additions during Friday’s call.

One deal involved 14 communities operated by Tucson Arizona-based Watermark Retirement. Welltower anticipates achieving a double-digit unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) on this deal by executing a “higher and better use strategy” Mitra said.

In other words these communities are located in desirable micromarkets and present opportunities for strategic expansion or repositioning. For example one community in the Bellevue Washington area includes a piece of residential-zoned land where Welltower could develop a vertical senior living or wellness-focused property; or the REIT could sell the land to a multifamily developer.

Such a real estate value-add strategy is enabled by the addition of Burkart and the hire of Mike Ferry as SVP and head of global development. These leaders and their teams have brought the needed expertise to Welltower which has struggled in the past to execute on these types of opportunities Mitra said.

Another of the new acquisitions involves five communities in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast with an average age of three years. Mitra said that Welltower will in the future disclose the identity of the “extraordinary” operator and developer of the communities.

“Here is a teaser — this team has executed flawlessly even during this challenging Q3 without any agency labor. That gives you a sense of their operating prowess” he said.

Dealmaking at the moment is largely being driven by sellers coming up on debt maturities so they prize the certainty of a close highly Mitra said noting that Welltower can execute these types of deals with speed and certainty thanks largely to its data analytics capabilities and the company’s roster of high-quality operators.

The third-quarter labor challenges have caused a significant number of owners to seek an exit from senior housing continuing the churn that began during the pandemic according to Mitra. The conditions continue to be ripe for Welltower to execute on its investment strategy of acquiring in the right micro-markets with the right operators and at the right discount to replacement cost.

“I remain very optimistic that this trend of acquisition at these kinds of prices will continue — frankly longer than I thought” Mitra said.

And Welltower certainly has the dry powder to keep executing deals as Stifel analysts noted.

“With $303 million of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet $4.0 billion of availability liquidity (WELL just expanded credit facility) and no material senior unsecured note maturities until 2024 WELL’s liquidity position is very strong. We assume that the cash will be redeployed into acquisitions over the next year or two” they wrote.

Mitra’s optimism in the midst of current challenges seemed to resonate with investors on Friday as the REIT’s share price climbed 5.32% to end the day at $84.64.",,,,,,,,,,,,

L'Oréal

French cosmetics company L'Oréal uses its advanced technologies and innovative ideas to give consumers more choice in customized cosmetics as well as contribute to sustainable development.

Women who feel it's difficult to pick a lipstick when hanging out now can make their own with YSL ROUGE SUR MESUR a smart ""lipstick printer.""

This portable bottle-like device which made its debut at the CIIE allows them to mix lip gloss of different colors and work out a color fitting them through technologies like augmented reality.

After putting tubes of lip gloss into the device users can connect it with their smartphone via a mobile application. Then they can choose a color from the color spectrum from the color of an item on the photo or from artificial intelligence analysis with the colors of their hair and clothes.

Then the device will release different amount of lip gloss from each tube and mix it to obtain the desired color.

Another device L'Oréal has brought to the CIIE for the first time is its water-saving hair care equipment.

L'Oréal Water Saver jointly developed by L'Oréal Group and the Swiss environmental innovation company Gjosa takes advantage of the fractional distillation principle design for rocket engines. It manages to lead precise collision between water flows which can form super tiny water droplets only one-tenth of the size of ordinary water droplets.

By this innovative process the washing efficiency is greatly improved and is able to save up to 80 percent water.

The system also provides users a one-stop hair care experience. It is able to mix up to three different products including shampoo conditioner and hair mask into tiny high-speed water droplets based on individual preferences. Meanwhile the powerful water flows will also give a massage-like comfort experience making the hair wash and care experience more personalized and enjoyable.

Shiseido

Shiseido has developed a technology which can create a daily ""second-layer skin"" – a kind of thin coating that can be applied to a person's face to relieve under-eye puffiness quickly.

By touching a large screen at the digital interaction area set by Shiseido visitors can see how under-eye puffiness disappears with the new technology.

Shiseido's Perfect UV Protector which is nicknamed ""Blue Fatty"" because of its cute ball-like blue bottle will soon have a new member to its family. The ""Pink Fatty"" debuted at the CIIE can nourish the skin as well as protecting it from the sun.

Anessa another brand under Shiseido popular among Chinese for its sunscreen product also showcases seven new products. An upgraded traditional product gives better protection to sun and heat.

For sustainable development Shiseido brings its skincare brand Baum which was set up last year. Based on the concept of ""co-existing with the nature"" it uses recycled wood to make the packing and more than 90 percent of its products are made of natural materials. Another two brands under it Elixir and Ipsa also use eco-friendly packing.

Kose

When using a mask people usually find the one-size type does not fit very well. But now they can customize their own mask size with a machine showcased by Kose by scanning their face.

After collecting the 3D data of one's face with a tablet the computer can have a printer run off the dry mask paper and then the customer can apply the toning lotion on it to make their own mask.

Kose also brought a nail printer it has cooperated with CASIO over to the expo. It can let customers print the pattern they like on their nails. This year they had a designer create a set of three patterns specially for CIIE. They also have another two sets which are respectively designed for autumn and are gender-neutral.

During the expo it will hold events to give a waste cosmetics ""rebirth."" Working with start-up MÅNGATA Kose developed technologies that can recycle waste cosmetics to produce pigment.

Its brand Sekkisei is also a supporter of sustainable development. Its Clear Wellness series uses environment-friendly material Bio-PET made of bagasse which emits less carbon dioxide in production.

Besides recycled packing it has no paper instructions inside and instead there is a QR code on the box for digital ones. The ink printed on the goods is biomass ink which is easily degradable and has less impact on the environment. It is also considering placing recycling boxes in some stores for used containers.

P&G

P&G brand SK-II provides a device called ""Mini Magic Scan"" which can test the quality of one's skin and help find problems through artificial intelligence analysis.

After showing one's face in the frame on the mirror and giving some basic information the device will give analysis about the skin in three minutes.

Meanwhile a new limited edition of SK-II essence features the brand's first fully recyclable bottle themed with American Pop artist Andy Warhol.

It also comes in a gift set with a unique Andy Warhol TV inspired pouch made from regenerated nylon an infinitely recyclable sustainable yarn made from ocean and landfill nylon waste like abandoned fishing nets.

At the sustainability exhibition area of P&G its brand Herbal Essences launched a new natural hair care product called ""Perennial"" which adheres to the concept of sustainable development and environmental protection.

The aluminum bottle and refill pack reduces plastic consumption per milliliter by approximately 62 percent compared to the same volume of plastic bottle.

The company works with the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in the United Kingdom and the Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to support the Kew Gardens Millennium Seed Bank program and to help scientists study and protect 20 endangered plants in China. These plants are printed on the bottles.

This area showcases nine products from six categories to demonstrate P&G's innovative approach to sustainability with respect to product development and design.

The rejoice non-rinse conditioner saves water for each rinse of conditioner equal to one person's two weeks of drinking water. The Tide liquid and pods' bottle and boxes and Safeguard liquid hand soap and body wash bottle are all recyclable.

The OLAY peach cream reduced plastic consumption by 4 percent annually equaling to a reduction of 3 million bottles of mineral water while Oral-B iO electric toothbrush's packaging is transitioning from paper-plastics to paper only.

Coty

It feels like entering a garden when visiting Coty. People can enjoy the smell of modern versions generated from the four classic fragrances created by French perfumer Francois Coty the brand's founder from a few decorations designed as bell-shaped flowers with long stems.

Coty a newcomer to the CIIE is the first company to use sustainable ethanol from captured carbon emissions in fragrance production which is a huge technological breakthrough across the beauty industry. Ethanol is a vital ingredient in the production of fragrances making up approximately 80 percent of the final product.

It achieved this in partnership with Lanzatech a leader in the production of new-generation green and sustainable ingredients.

The latter's sun care product Lancaster Sun Sensitive offers clean and vegan formulas developed to be compliant with the strictest clean charter of application with 40 percent fewer ingredients. It's ocean friendly and the packaging is also eco-conscious containing a minimum of 50 percent post-consumer recycled materials.

Industrial emissions which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases are being transformed into fragrances by brands like Gucci Burberry and others.

The Chloe Naturelle is a fully natural origin fragrance which is developed with sustainably harvested ingredients including neroli rose cedar and citron and lower-impact packaging.

Unilever

People may think that cosmetics are only for facial use. But at the area of Unilever visitors can find ""make-up"" and ""mask"" for their teeth.

Among the four imported brands Unilever introduces to CIlE for the first time there is Signal a leading French oral whitening brand. Its whitening pen which is easy for carrying can help people make their teeth look white for urgent use such as dating and interviews.

Its 3D customized teeth whitening kit which applies special gel on the teeth like a ""mask"" will make one's teeth whiten as soon as six days in a safe way.

Another brand REGENERATE is the world's first toothpaste maker that repairs tooth enamel.

Unilever also has a ""Sustainable Action Wall"" showing how laundry detergent brand OMO ""air"" laundry capsules are made.

This product is the first laundry product on the market in the world that uses carbon capture technology to make carbon from the air. This breaks through the washing industry's tradition of extracting carbon from fossil fuels to make detergent surfactants. This ""green technology"" originated from Unilever's research and development team in China and was first listed in the Chinese market.

This is the first time that OMO's ""air"" laundry capsule has been showcased at CIIE providing Chinese consumers with another new option for ""green consumption"".

Estée Lauder

If you want to know details about your skin problems but are reluctant to see a doctor you can come to the area of Estée Lauder.

A machine which has three types of light sources to catch the surface middle and deep layers of one's skin clearly with a camera can detect wrinkles spots and clogged pores and give an evaluation and analysis.

After the camera takes three photos of one's face from left middle and right the machine can give a quick analysis. How serious the problem is will be marked with three colors – green yellow and red – from lowest to highest level.

Each part of the skin can be magnified on the screen with lines and circles to show where the problem is.

Decorating the booth with a model of a wooded valley with a train running around Jo Malone British fragrance and lifestyle brand under Estée Lauder introduce their latest three products based on natural ingredients including rose magnolia mandarin honey white moss and snowdrop all in well-designed bottles. The White Moss & Snowdrop is expected to retail in stores next month.

He left his 8000-square-foot penthouse apartment in Greenwich Village and hopped into a waiting Mercedes-Benz van which whizzed him a mile uptown to his helicopter propellers awhirl. Thirty-five minutes later he landed in a parking lot near the Wells Fargo Center where the 76ers play and was chauffeured to the arena in a Lincoln Navigator.

Mr. Rubin 49 is the founder and chief executive of Fanatics a 10-year-old company that manufactures and sells licensed merchandise online to fans of professional sports teams and more than 150 U.S. college athletic programs.

This balancing act is now at risk. On October 27th the fast-food giant said that due to rising costs prices at its American restaurants will increase by 6% this year compared with 2020. The burger chain says labour expenses have risen by 10% at its franchised restaurants and 15% at its company-owned locations. Add the rising cost of ingredients and the result is higher prices for burgers and fries. For now it seems customers can stomach it. Chris Kempczinski McDonald’s boss said the increase “has been pretty well received”. After digesting the news investors have sent shares in the fast-food firm up by 6%.

A growing number of companies are raising prices as costs for labour and raw materials rise often with no ill effects. This summer PepsiCo an American food giant lifted prices for its fizzy drinks and snacks to offset higher commodity and transport costs; it plans further increases early next year. Ramon Laguarta the firm’s boss suggested in an earnings call in October that customers do not seem bothered. “Across the world consumers seem to be looking at pricing a little bit differently than before” he said.

But on Saturday Nov. 6 All Hands Dentistry hosted a holiday fair — complete with alpacas — as part of the practice’s mission to change that and make the dentist’s office a place people of all ages can feel comfortable visiting.

Andre Sullivan the practice manager said that the event was meant to help kids have a good experience visiting the office. He explained that it’s important to have young children visit the dentist and build up their comfort level. Then if they need a filling or other dental work they can approach that experience with less stress.

Sullivan explained that the office hosts a rotating selection of art by local artists and each exhibition is paired with an opening event. Sullivan and his wife dentist Dr. Allyce C. Sullivan had planned to exhibit the holiday wreaths crafted by their daughter Eloise with her grandmother Ellen Russell.

“If we’re doing that [opening] why not do a holiday fair?” Andre Sullivan said. The event doubled as a celebration of the first anniversary of the office’s opening.

On Saturday local artists and vendors set up their wares out front and inside the office and friendly alpacas enjoyed the sunshine while Dr. Sullivan served up cider and hot cocoa.

A steady crowd explored the facility.

“The local area has been amazing” said Andre Sullivan.

Dr. Sullivan said the turnout for the event had been “fantastic” with many new people checking out the office.

“We’re just trying to become a part of the community” Sullivan said.

The practice is open to people of all ages she said. Right now the office is collecting Halloween candy to be sent to the troops overseas. Kids who bring in candy can enter raffles to win various toys — including a Play-Doh dentistry kit.

“It’s a delight to be here” said photographer Russ Saunders whose art was on display. “It’s a wonderful showroom and a wonderful family.”

Kitty de Groot of the Buzzards Bay Bee Company said she was impressed by how comfortable kids seemed at the event.

“I’ve watched people come in with little kids today and I can tell it’s changed something” she said.

Dr. Sullivan noted that the office would officially turn on its Christmas lights that night Nov. 6.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGZvcm1lcnMuY29tL2xhcmtpbnMtbGFpci1raW5nZG9tLW1heGltYWwtc2t5d2FycC1mZWF0aGVyLXN3b3Jkcy11cGdyYWRlLzQzNjU0L25ld3MuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Larkin's Lair Kingdom Maximal Skywarp Feather Swords Upgrade,"Entertainment News International (ENI) is the #1 popular culture network for adult fans all around the world.

Artist Anna Hultin aka Olander Co Embroidery captures the diversity of the Colorado environment through her abstract embroideries. She renders grassy fields vibrant blooms and tiny animals using a variety of stitches and threads.

“As a child I never thought Colorado’s landscape was all that beautiful but in an effort to grow roots in this place I closely observed the textures of the grasses and reeds in the foothills and plains and turned it into art” Hultin tells My Modern Met. She uses abstraction to highlight a particular part of the landscape so that it appears to float against a white background. Sometimes these landscapes even “drip” out of the hoop. “By bringing to life the riotous beauty I see in what would typically be regarded as a monotonous landscape I offer my audience a new framework from which to view their environs.”

From cows grazing on a verdant hill to a flock of birds taking off into a blue sky Hultin lets each of these little worlds shine through thoughtful editing. “Life and art and land have become inextricably entwined in my life” she explains. “Whether I am embroidering every plant growing in my garden or the textures of the vast Colorado plains I am constantly exploring what it means to find a place on this land.”

Scroll down to admire Hultin's work. You can purchase original embroidery art and kits via her Etsy shop and you can keep up to date with her latest projects by following the artist on Instagram.

There have been growing calls in recent years including from the prime minister’s wife Carrie Johnson to ban attractions and experiences that involve captive sea creatures.

Announcing the move on Twitter the company said: “We recently adjusted our animal welfare policy. As a result attractions and activities that involve performances by or interactions with dolphins and other cetaceans will no longer be available on our sites.”

It further clarifies on the Expedia website that “seaside sanctuaries that provide captive animals with a permanent seaside living environment are allowed if they are accredited and do not feature interactions or performances”.

Campaigners are hopeful other companies will follow suit. Virgin Holidays announced in 2019 it would no longer sell tickets to such attractions and experiences.

Katheryn Wise from the wildlife charity World Animal Protection said: “This is amazing news and something that we have been campaigning for since 2019. We are so pleased that they have listened.

“Travel companies play a huge role in driving captive dolphin entertainment and as one of the largest travel companies in the world we are delighted that Expedia Group are making a stand. It’s time for other travel giants … to do the right thing and follow suit.”

The PA Media news agency reported that the company intended to implement the policy by early 2022. “We give our providers 30 days to comply with the updated policy or face removal from the site” Expedia said.

The last captive dolphin attraction in the UK closed in 2003 but people can still travel abroad for the activities. There are more than 3000 dolphins held in captive conditions at tourist entertainment venues around the world.

The company has also stated it does not “allow intentional physical contact with wild and exotic animals which include but are not limited to dolphins whales cetaceans elephants big cats bears reptiles and primates” and also does not sell activities involving exotic pet cafes restaurants and travelling zoos.

Travel companies are increasingly moving to distance themselves from unethical animal attractions. Intrepid Travel set off a domino effect among other companies when it ceased all elephant ride activities in 2014.

A spokesman told the Mail on Sunday that the company will continue to sell tickets to ""seaside sanctuaries that provide captive animals with a permanent seaside living environment"" if they ""are accredited and do not feature interactions or performances"".

The firm said the change will take time to implement and it intends to complete the process by early 2022.

The tourism practice has come under criticism from prominent figures like Carrie Johnson the prime minister's wife as well as animal rights activists.

Virgin Holidays made a similar move in 2019 announcing it would no longer sell tickets to these kinds of attractions or experiences.

SeaWorld parks in San Diego and Florida are among those that will be affected having struggled to combat public perception of its parks since the 2013 documentary Blackfish shined a light on the lives of killer whales in captivity.

Animal rights group PETA praised the decision saying it comes after its campaigners were encouraged to flood Expedia's president with calls and messages.

""PETA congratulates Expedia for officially rejecting cruel 'swim with dolphins' encounters and SeaWorld prisons"" said PETA executive vice president Tracy Reiman.

""PETA urges people to take note and do their part by refusing to support such animal-exploiting operations.""

The group alleged that dolphins that swim with tourists are confined to barren tanks or makeshift lagoons with no choice but to swim in endless circles.

""Many die prematurely because of the stressful conditions of captivity "" it claimed.

Wildlife charity World Animal Protection called it ""amazing news"" that would hopefully prompt change throughout the industry.

""It's time for other travel giants like TUI to do the right thing and follow suit.""

SeaWorld has previously said that animal activists manipulate marine science to advance their agendas adding: ""With rising threats to our oceans and their inhabitants supporting independently accredited zoological facilities is more important than ever.

""No company does more to protect marine mammals and advance cetacean research rescue and conservation than SeaWorld.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vamVyc2V5ZXZlbmluZ3Bvc3QuY29tL21vcmVuZXdzL3VrbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExLzA3L2V4cGVkaWEtYmFucy1ob2xpZGF5cy10by1zZWUtY2FwdGl2ZS1kb2xwaGlucy1hbmQtd2hhbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expedia bans holidays to see captive dolphins and whales,"Travel firm Expedia has stopped selling holidays which include performances by captive dolphins and whales.

TRAVEL giant Expedia has BANNED travel holidays to see captive dolphins and whales perform following a massive backlash.

The popular interactive activities - where cash-splashing tourists can ""swim with dolphins"" - have been blacklisted by the travel site amid outcry from animal welfare campaigners and high-profile celebs.

On Friday an Expedia Twitter statement read: ""We recently adjusted our animal welfare policy.

""As a result attractions and activities that involve performances by or interactions with dolphins and other cetaceans will no longer be available on our sites.""

A spokesperson later told the Mail on Sunday: ""Seaside sanctuaries that provide captive animals with a permanent seaside living environment are allowed if they are accredited and do not feature interactions or performances.""

The ban will kick in from early 2022 Expedia confirmed.

Katheryn Wise - Wildlife Campaign Manager at World Animal Protection UK - said: ""This is amazing news and something we have been campaigning for since 2019.

""Over 350000 supporters joined us in signing petitions raising awareness online and hitting the streets to ask Expedia Group to make this change and we are so pleased that they have listened.

""Through sales and promotion travel companies play a huge role in driving captive dolphin entertainment and as one of the largest travel companies in the world we are delighted that Expedia Group are making a stand.

""It's time for other travel giants like TUI to do the right thing and follow suit.""

In 2019 British Airways announced it will no longer sell tickets to attractions such as SeaWorld - which feature animals including whales and dolphins in seemingly cramped enclosures.

The move came weeks after Virgin Holidays announced a similar move.

But the boss of SeaWorld at the time accused British Airways Holidays of ""succumbing to pressure"" from activists according to Travel Weekly.

SeaWorld CEO Gus Antorcha told Sun Online Travel in a statement: ""When radical animal rights activists mislead and manipulate the truth to the detriment of our planet’s critically endangered animals you have to question their motives.

""Pressuring companies and trying to shame them into cutting ties with independently accredited zoos and aquariums works against the vital research and conservation work to protect these animals.

""We are disappointed that British Airways Holidays succumbed to pressure from animal activists and changed its policy given the facts.""

In 2018 Thomas Cook stopped promoting and selling tickets to SeaWorld after a number of animal rights protests.

SeaWorld was forced to stop pool performances with killer whales following the controversial documentary Blackfish.

The 2013 documentary revealed the life of Tilikum a killer whale who killed his trainer in 2010 who later died in 2017.

As the world moves away from fossil fuels and adopts more clean and renewable energy sources oil giants that have dominated markets for more than a century could be in trouble the Microsoft co-founder said in a briefing at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow Scotland on Thursday.

""Some of these giants will fall. You know 30 years from now some of those oil companies will be worth very little"" Gates an outspoken advocate for investing in renewable energy and green technologies said at the briefing according to Axios.

Companies like ExxonMobil BP and Royal Dutch Shell all have seen their stock prices decline over the past five years — especially at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic which crippled demand for oil and resulted in huge losses for even the biggest oil and gas companies.

ExxonMobil the largest oil and gas producer in the U.S. lost $20 billion in last year. The company still sports a market value of $275 billion — but as countries like the U.S. shift their energy policies to fight climate change and the automotive industry moves toward an electric future investors are becoming increasingly dubious about the future of oil stocks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2Jsb2dzLXRyZW5kaW5nLTU5MDcwNDUx0gE2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYmxvZ3MtdHJlbmRpbmctNTkwNzA0NTEuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Climate change: The US state taking on an oil giant for greenwashing,"""They'll just fight it out forever.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The strong employment reports this week showed companies are creating jobs but many employers are complaining that they cannot find workers to hire. That is just one of the factors being blamed for some of the supply chain blockage. We go now to FedEx CEO Fred Smith who joins us from Memphis Tennessee. Good morning to you.

FEDEX CHAIRMAN AND CEO FRED SMITH: Good morning to you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to all that in a moment but I want to ask you first about this infrastructure bill that is headed to the president's desk. Twenty-five billion on airport runways 110 billion to highways investments in rail you touch a large amount of transportation in this country. What does this bill do for you?

SMITH: Well it's just- it's a step in the right direction. I haven't seen the details of the bill but one of the three reasons that we're having the supply chain problems that we're having is the lack of investment in infrastructure and other policy changes that could have made our logistics system more flexible and nimble. So we applaud the- the Congress and the president for getting this bill passed. Any improvement in the logistics system will inure to the benefit of the American people.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well last Sunday we had the commerce secretary with us and asked her about these delays in the supply chain blockage. She said call FedEx if you want to know if your Christmas presents are going to arrive on time. So what's the answer to the question will they?

SMITH: Yes I think we're ready for this. This year we're forecasting we will deliver 100 million more shipments in this holiday season than we did in 2019. That's a result of our leaning into e-commerce some years ago making billions of dollars of investments including modernizing our airplane fleet to use less energy and emit less CO2. So the secretary made a wise recommendation there. We're ready assuming that we can- can get the employees. The lack of employees particularly since last spring and into the summer partially because of the Delta variant and partially because of the stimulus which hit right before the Delta variant took hold of a lot of the country created a lot of employment issues. Not just for us the CFO of Amazon talked about this in depth on the 28th of October and their analyst called. So to put this in perspective the week of May the eighth we were processing about 50000 applications a day this past week beginning Nov. 1 we're processing 90000 employment applications and hiring many many thousands of people to operate in our 60 plus global hubs that allow us to pick up and transport deliver between any two points on the globe. So that's very encouraging. And it's why I believe that the delivery part of the supply chain which is very very important to the E commerce recipients the at home recipients will work well this peak season.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you at FedEx don't have your own mandate for employees to go out and get the COVID vaccine. But now as you know the administration is rolling one out. Do you expect a large number of workers to- to walk out of the job in January or is that you know a misplaced fear?

SMITH: Well it's not a misplaced fear but let me come in the administration for moving the federal contractor mandate from Dec. 8 which could have put some of the deliveries in- in peril to Jan. 4 and even more importantly to give us the flexibility to try to get all of our people vaccinated. We strongly support it. I'm vaccinated. We've made every effort. We pay bonuses to people to get vaccinated. But the people that operate the pickup and delivery systems the warehouses and the fulfillment and sortation centers that make this country's logistics system go there's a fair number of them a large percentage that simply do not want to be vaccinated. That's not just hearsay. I was in a couple of our facilities just two days ago and had that confirmed by a number of our front-line managers. And it's what we're hearing throughout our system. So this was a wise decision to move the mandate.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well so then what are you going to do when the mandate does take effect? Are you just going to have to pay fines? Or is this manageable?

SMITH: Well that's where I noted the- the federal government is giving us the flexibility to do that. We'll try any and everything. Incentives and you know encouragement or what have you. We think we'll be able to work through it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of rising prices. I know jet fuel prices are up like 70% in the past year crude oil spiking. You look at FedEx you've had to raise prices in the coming year. For people who are looking around and saying my cost of living is going up do you see any relief on the horizon?

SMITH: Well we do. The inflation in the last quarter was about 5.4%. There is so much money. Demand is about 15% higher for goods today than it was in February 2020. And there are supply constraints. And in the case of- of energy the demand coming back much more rapidly than people thought it would has raised the prices of energy. But we believe that the inflation will in the middle of '22 begin to- to drift down a bit. But the main thing is to unclog the supply chains which are having problems because of the so-called bullwhip effect the lack of employment and our inability to improve our infrastructure over the last 20 years. All three of those have- have had a big effect on the availability of moving goods through our system.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right Fred Smith thank you for answering the question and we'll look out for those Christmas presents. As you say should be arriving on time. We'll be back in a moment with some political analysis. Stay with us.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mZWRleC1leHByZXNzLXBsYW5zLW5ldy1odWItYXQtZHViYWktd29ybGQtY2VudHJhbC1haXJwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx Express Plans New Hub At Dubai World Central Airport,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mZWRleC1leHByZXNzLXBsYW5zLW5ldy1odWItYXQtZHViYWktd29ybGQtY2VudHJhbC1haXJwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkueWFob28uY29tL2ZlZGV4LWNlby1zYXlzLWNvbXBhbnktbWVldC0xNzI3NTU4MjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx CEO says company can meet holiday demand,"Washington — With the holiday season approaching delays in the U.S. supply chain have raised the question of whether shipping companies will be able to meet the holiday demand.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told ""Face the Nation"" that consumers should ""call FedEx"" if they wanted to ensure that their packages would arrive in time for Christmas. In response FedEx CEO Fred Smith said Sunday that his company will be able to make holiday deliveries on time if it can hire enough employees to do so.

""We're ready assuming that we can get the employees"" Smith said in an interview with ""Face the Nation.""

Transcript: FedEx CEO Fred Smith on ""Face the Nation""

According to Smith FedEx has processed 90000 employee applications since November 1 compared to 50000 over a one-week period in May. Smith said this is ""very encouraging"" because the lack of employees is contributing to delays. He also said the ""inability to improve infrastructure over the last 20 years"" was a key factor and praised Congress for passing the bipartisan infrastructure deal on Friday.

Another issue employers currently face is how to deal with the new federal COVID-19 vaccine or testing mandate for companies with more than 100 employees. Asked if he feared a large number of employee walkouts when the deadline arrives on January 4 Smith said it was not a ""misplaced fear.""

""But let me commend the administration for moving the federal contractor mandate from December 8 which could have put some of the deliveries in peril to January 4 and even more importantly to give us the flexibility to try to get all of our people vaccinated. We strongly support it"" Smith said noting that FedEx has made efforts to encourage vaccination through incentives like bonuses. ""But the people that operate the pickup and delivery systems the warehouses and the fulfillment and sortation centers that make this country's logistics system go there's a fair number of them a large percentage that simply do not want to be vaccinated.""

Smith forecast that FedEx will deliver 100 million more shipments this holiday season than they did in 2019. He attributes this to the company's investments in e-commerce and the modernization of its airplane fleets to use less energy and emit less carbon dioxide.

FENTON Mo. — An Amazon employee calls what happened early Friday morning at the Fenton distribution center ""frightening and frustrating.""

The 23-year-old employee who asked 5 On Your Side to not disclose her identity said a dashcam in her car caught a desperate crook breaking into her vehicle.

""It shows him when he's in my car climbing through the window rummaging through my center console and just through all my stuff. It's so frustrating and just an invasion of privacy"" she said.

St. Louis County police said the woman's car and several others were broken into around 4 a.m. at the Amazon facility on Assembly Parkway the site of the former Chrysler vehicle assembly plant.

""We go out for lunchtime and we just see a bunch of glass on the ground everywhere"" she said.

She then said about a dozen more locked vehicles on the same employee parking lot were hit overnight Saturday.

""They just stole a vape pen from me so I'm one of the lucky ones"" she added.

However police said other victims weren't so lucky — cash purses and wallets were also stolen. A gun was stolen from one of the vehicles on the Fenton lot.

Another Amazon distribution facility on Premiere Parkway in St. Peters also saw several vehicle break-ins. Police said 32 vehicles were broken into on October 26 and similar items were taken from six of them.

Across the Mississippi River in Sauget Illinois police said on Thursday vandals smashed about a dozen car windows at a FedEx facility on Vincent Drive near St. Louis Downtown Airport.

In a statement a FedEx spokesman said ""safety is a top priority at FedEx Ground and we are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate this and similar incidents that have been occurring in the vicinity"" adding the company is taking steps to enhance security at the facility.

For their part police are now trying to figure out if the car break-ins are connected.

""I'm very glad no one was hurt — super glad no one ended up going outside when all that happened. I just hope these people get call and all these break-ins stop"" said the Fenton Amazon employee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpheXNraS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNy9kZW5ueS1oYW1saW4tcGl0LWxhbmUtdHYtcXVvdGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Denny Hamlin Pit Lane TV Quotes,"AVONDALE ARIZONA - NOVEMBER 07: Denny Hamlin driver of the #11 FedEx Express Toyota drives during the NASCAR Cup Series Championship at Phoenix Raceway on November 07 2021 in Avondale Arizona.

An Interview with:

Denny Hamlin

A piece of debris changed everything. How close were you to getting this done?

DENNY HAMLIN: Yeah certainly I really liked where we were at with about 25 to go. We were just exceptional in the long run which wasn’t too surprising but started running the 19 back down there and got within a couple car lengths and obviously that debris caution changed a lot.

Special congrats to Larson and his team. Those guys any time you can win 10 races in a year you’re absolutely a deserving champion. They did a great job on the last pit stop and got him out there and it was just set sail after that.

Proud of my team. Really great effort adjusting on the car all day getting it so much better and thank our partners in Toyota FedEx Coca-Cola Jordan Brand. Just a really good year. A really really good year and things just didn’t pan out.

We needed that thing to go green those last 25 laps and it didn’t.

Here are just 11 of them (listed and pictured in alphabetical order) leading the charge in areas of green business alternative energy and environmental preservation -- in their own words.

Tony Anderson GM Cherryland Electric

Green claim to fame: Cherryland planned built and sold out the first community solar project in Michigan in partnership with Traverse City Light and Power in operation since 2013. We were also the first utility in the state of Michigan to do a pilot of Michigan SAVES; the first in the state and first in the nation to do a low-income solar pilot project; the first and only utility in the state to offer a $2000 rebate on electric vehicles; and one of five electric cooperatives in Michigan with a wholesale power supply portfolio that is over 60 percent carbon free.

What Traverse City needs most to be a green leader: Less talk more action. Goals in far-off years are mere words. We need projects in the ground and plans put into action.

Nathan Bildeaux Co-founder Traverse Solar

Green claim to fame: When Traverse Solar was founded we wanted to be thought leaders in the renewable energy technology sector…That's where we came in with the idea that everyone should have access to a simple and reliable means to move solar panels (that) follow the sun. We engineered and now manufacture a solar panel tracker…By pointing panels directly at the sun power generation increases by 30 percent in the non-winter months and 70 percent during the snowy season…”

What Traverse City needs most: Traverse City needs green leaders that are not afraid to be vocal steadfast voices for sustainability. We need a unified strategy to guide our decision-making that makes environmental stewardship a priority. We entice visitors to the area by touting our great outdoors.

Glen Chown Executive Director Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy

Green claim to fame: For three decades I have been honored to oversee the Conservancy's efforts to protect significant natural scenic and farm lands in Antrim Benzie Grand Traverse Kalkaska and Manistee counties. To date we have preserved some 46000 acres of land and 149 miles of shoreline in the region. This includes protecting and establishing 44 Conservancy-owned nature preserves and sanctuaries as well as 30 publicly owned parks and natural areas.

What Traverse City needs most: We need to encourage more private-public partnerships and more collaboration in the future. There are tremendous challenges that require innovative thinking substantial investments of time and treasure and what we at the Conservancy like to call ‘radical interdependence.’

Nathan Griswold President Inhabitect

Green claim to fame: I was lucky enough to play an active role in the development of the green roof industry in North America. This experience has allowed me to work on over 1000 green roof projects with a growing list of projects here in northern Michigan. I founded Inhabitect in 2013 with the hope of creating lasting change in the place that I have always called home: northern Michigan.

What Traverse City needs most: Traverse City and the surrounding townships communities and counties must adopt policies mandates and incentive programs that are supportive of green stormwater infrastructure. Stormwater must be infiltrated first and then slowed and cooled down before entering our rivers lakes and bays. Managing water with natural landscapes vegetated rooftops and other permeable surfaces will help to reduce problems with stormwater and sewage overflows within the city limits.

Liz Kirkwood Executive Director For Love of Water (FLOW)

Green claim to fame: My legal and advocacy work to shut down Line 5 has been important in this multi-year collaborative campaign to protect our Great Lakes from a catastrophic oil spill. Early on our founder Jim Olson and I identified the State of Michigan’s role as public trustee as one of the key levers to revoking and terminating the Line 5 easement in the Straits of Mackinac. We dug up the original 1953 easement from the DNR offices and documented Enbridge’s egregious and ongoing violations; we consulted with risk experts to evaluate and report on alternatives to piping oil through the heart of the Great Lakes; we joined and helped build the Oil & Water Don’t Mix Campaign to engage and empower citizens lawmakers advisory boards and task forces; we published the first economic analysis of a Line 5 pipeline spill; and we continue working every day with committed partners and the tribes to uphold the State of Michigan’s sovereign right to protect the Great Lakes…”

What Traverse City needs most: To protect this 'Freshwater Capital in the Great Lakes' as I like to call it we must be proactive and articulate a sustainable vision centered around water. It will require green or blue leaders to connect with passionate people in every sector of business government and nonprofit.

Bill Latka Producer/Director/Business Owner Storylicious and Rivet Entertainment

Green claim to fame: Near the end of my 20 years living in Los Angeles…my writing partner and I sold a documentary series about climate change solutions to Discovery Channel. My team spoke daily with leading climate scientists and sustainability experts worldwide to inform our story during the 18-month research and writing phase. I traveled the globe and saw firsthand the impact our overheating climate was already exacting on people and the planet. When I moved back to Traverse City in 2008…I committed myself to support nonprofits and companies here and across the state working on climate and sustainability solutions…I co-founded and still work on the Oil & Water Don't Mix campaign to shut down the Enbridge Line 5 oil pipeline in the Straits of Mackinac. I grew the Michigan Climate Action Network social media presence to one of the largest in the state. I'm now launching a climate solutions storytelling project called See Change (seechangemedia.org) to activate the public to scale up the implementation of climate solutions.

What Traverse City needs most: Traverse City is a hotbed of environmental activism precisely because it's in the middle of 21 percent of the world's fresh surface water.

Jim Lively Climate and Environment Program Director Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities

Green claim to fame: More than a decade ago I was very involved in organizing the regional Grand Vision public input process. In 2013 I was an early organizer of the Oil and Water Don't Mix campaign to shut down the Line 5 pipeline. And I'm proud to have been involved in organizing the Great Lakes Business Network and initial efforts around the Michigan Climate Action Network.

What Traverse City needs most: We need to drastically modify our energy system to stop burning fossil fuels as quickly as possible. This is a huge global effort and our region is leading many positive initiatives.

Jim MacInnes CEO and Co-owner Crystal Mountain Resort

Green claim to fame: I served for nine years on the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy board; two years on the Michigan Great Lakes Offshore Wind Council; and 10 years as chairman of the Michigan Utility Consumer Participation board…I was named as one of 16 Green Leaders in Michigan in 2010 by the Detroit Free Press and as Energy Innovator of the Year in 2015 by the Michigan Agency for Energy. I received the Northern Michigan Environmental Action Council’s Environmentalist of the Year award in 2017 and was inducted into the Michigan Energy Innovators Business Council Hall of Fame in 2019. At Crystal Mountain our development team built the first LEED-certified spa and fitness center in the Midwest in 2009. We were the first to install free public EV charging up north in 2011. We re-lamped our 330000-square-foot conference center with LED lights in 2012 saving 75000 kilowatt-hours for energy per year. And we installed an all-electric closed loop geothermal heat pump HVAC system for our 30000-square-foot inn residences building in 2017.

What Traverse City needs most: Strong advocacy is what is needed the most – for clean water reduced waste low-carbon electricity transmission systems that enable low-carbon electricity biodiversity local healthy food or whatever environmental issues you are passionate about.

Kate Madigan Executive Director Michigan Climate Action Network

Green claim to fame: Helping found and build the Oil & Water Don't Mix campaign which helped elevate Line 5 to be a top issue in Michigan and to convince Governor Whitmer to take action this year. Leading the local organizing effort for Traverse City and TCLP to set the first community-wide 100 percent renewable energy goal in the state. Successfully advocating for Governor Whitmer to set a goal for Michigan to be carbon neutral by 2050. Winning the ruling that now allows climate change evidence to be included in a state agency's decision for the very first time; we are now presenting climate evidence as part of the state's decision about the Line 5 oil tunnel. Building and leading the Michigan Climate Action Network (MiCAN).

What Traverse City needs most: Thanks to the goals that the city and TCLP set in recent years city operations are already powered by 100 percent renewable energy and TCLP has added new solar projects to get to 40 percent renewables soon…But to prevent the climate impacts we are now seeing from getting much worse…we need to get off fossil fuel-powered electricity even faster and we need to electrify everything – including our buildings and transportation. I'd like to see Traverse City set a carbon-neutrality goal and develop a plan for how our community can get there.

Tim Pulliam President Keen Technical Solutions

Green claim to fame: At Keen we have been able to work across the country in the industrial and manufacturing setting on efficiency-related programs. Through these projects we have removed over 1.5 billion wasted kilowatts from the grid. While these big numbers sound impressive the amount of waste across that sector in enormous. The most fulfilling changes are the smaller more cultural changes we experience with our team clients vendors and at home with our families…

What Traverse City needs most: Our region has an opportunity to be a model. It’s one of the reasons for the crazy demand our area has been experiencing. It’s going to take big and crazy ideas to protect our local environment while sustainably managing this growth. We have to message it properly so that the new businesses developers and residents see the value that is attracting them in the first place.

Tim Werner City Commissioner City of TC; Board Member Traverse City Light & Power

Green claim to fame: I feel fortunate to have been part of the efforts in moving both the city and Traverse City Light & Power (TCLP) forward to renewable energy goals. The city in 2016 announced a 100 percent renewable electricity goal for city buildings and city operations by 2020. In the fall of 2018 TCLP announced a goal of 100 percent renewable electricity by 2040 and an interim goal of 40 percent by 2025. The city proper was out in front and I think that helped apply some pressure to TCLP in a positive way.

What Traverse City needs most: To me it's to continue building momentum. I feel we have momentum and can continue to build it. Part of why I'm excited about the Fish Pass project is that it’s a unique project that will attract attention. People will come to Traverse City to see what's going on with that Fish Pass project. We could be doing the same with TCLP’s renewable energy goals. All these various aspects of the puzzle – electric vehicles battery storage building electrification – we can kind of be out there on the cutting edge of showing other communities what’s possible.

Harsh Patel Eshaan Sharma and Ankit Mithbavkar all seniors at McNair captured first place in the 2021 Green Ambassador Program sponsored by Solar Landscape and Sustainable Jersey City.

Solar Landscape is a leading New Jersey designer and operator of solar energy technology for the commercial municipal and nonprofit marketplace.

Sustainable Jersey City is a nonprofit network of individuals government and charitable organizations that sponsor various green initiatives to make Jersey City more ecologically sustainable. Their projects include developing rain gardens and community composting sites inventorying the city’s trees and conducting research on the many effects of the city’s diminishing tree canopy.

The two groups combined to award $20000 in scholarships to 23 New Jersey high school students for developing compelling clean energy projects.

Students attended five online webinars hosted by Solar Landscape then submitted videos outlining a concept for making an existing product more sustainable or for strengthening the sustainability efforts of a community.

“We actually started this project in our freshman year” said Sharma “because of our mutual interest in how urban irrigation systems are evolving.” Sharma is also an “ambassador” for Inspirit AI a program sponsored by Stanford and MIT graduate students to teach middle and high school students artificial intelligence.

In a recorded presentation to the judges the McNair representatives all members of the Science Research Club at the school outlined their approach to developing a system for irrigating a four-quadrant 10-foot-by-10-foot plot of land.

Their working model consisted of eight interconnected pipes each section measuring 5 feet in length linked by four elbow joints and an 800-gallon submersible pump – all self-contained with no moving parts. Each pipe features holes to facilitate water flow and minimize water waste.

According to the students their apparatus could support up to four different plant species and be assembled in five hours for just $209.

Initially the students said they’ll pitch their irrigation proposal to two middle schools in Ward F (Frank R. Conwell M.S. 4 and Academy 1 M.S.) and to several of the city’s community gardens (Ogden’s End in the Heights Waldo Avenue gardens in Journal Square and Brunswick Street gardens Downtown.

If they can create sustainable irrigation systems there they would like to build larger-scale models for adoption by local municipal parks.

That sits very well with Debra Italiano founder and president of Sustainable Jersey City. Italiano lauded the winners for “the simplicity and thoroughness” of their irrigation system along with their “clear implementation plan and low-cost budget.”

“We can now enjoy silence and hear our animals and the crows caw from across our village for the first time in 50 years” said Tizya-Tramm in a video address to a panel discussing Indigenous renewable micro-grids (REMs) at the UN climate conference in Glasgow .

But the fly-in community 120 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle was quiet for the first time in decades as the nation brought its solar energy micro-grid online said Chief Dana Tizya-Tramm at an official COP26 side event Thursday.

For generations the community of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation in the Yukon about 100 kilometres east of the Alaskan border had suffered the incessant drone of diesel-powered generators to meet its electricity needs.

For the first time since the 1970s silence descended on the tiny isolated village of Old Crow in Canada’s Arctic in August.

The project’s 2160 panels maximize solar generation during the long daylight hours of the Arctic’s summer sun. The array ties into a 616-kilowatt battery energy storage system and micro-grid controller reducing the use of diesel generators by 2000 hours or 189000 litres of diesel fuel annually.

The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation boldly undertook one of the largest solar panel projects in Canada’s North as an important step to transition away from fossil fuels to renewables and meet the community’s goal of reaching net-zero carbon emission by 2030 Tizya-Tramm said.

The community-led solar initiative signals the emergence of new relationships between Indigenous people and the energy sector Tizya-Tramm said with Indigenous clean energy leaders establishing the framework for disruptive business models.

The Arctic region in Canada and Indigenous people are being impacted by the worst effects of climate change — with temperatures rising at three times the global average.

The REM is expected to reduce 680 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and meet a quarter of the community’s energy needs.

Under a 25-year electricity purchase agreement with ATCO Electric Yukon energy generated by the solar project will be bought at rates similar to the cost of diesel generation.

“Our electricity purchase agreement now diverts over $410000 a year back into our community” he said adding the money will be used to fund other renewable energy projects.

Such Indigenous clean energy projects empower Indigenous rights and communities Tizya-Tramm said.

“We as individuals across the world cannot simply give our power to international negotiators at any cost” he said.

“We cannot give our power to CEOs or leaders; we as individuals need to find our identity.”

Ambika Opal manager of global initiatives at the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy (WISE) said renewable micro-grids offer populations struggling with energy poverty clean and affordable alternatives.

But getting up and running can be challenging she said.

First and foremost trust-building in the community is key to achieving buy-in for any clean energy project as is incorporating Indigenous land-based knowledge into the development of solutions.

Other critical success factors include identifying community energy champions with knowledge of the area and ensuring the involvement and empowerment of women Opal said.

Job creation is a priority and grant applications focusing on community needs around clean water health or housing are important.

The costs of REMs are still prohibitively expensive particularly for small Indigenous communities she said. Another persistent difficulty is maintaining and operating the systems without training community members.

The struggle to get the necessary information or data such as demand forecasting makes producing feasibility assessments difficult Opal said issuing a call to action to researchers educational institutions and policymakers to step up and help overcome hurdles.

Canada’s Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson acknowledged the leadership and influence Indigenous communities have had in helping the country reach its net-zero target and sustainable development goals (SDGs).

The government is making generational investments to help remote communities move off fossil fuels such as diesel and propane he told the panel.

The federal government has committed $300 million over five years to help transition rural remote and Indigenous communities to clean energy he said.

Wilkinson also announced that Canada is investing $500000 in partnership with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to share best practices to help remote communities make the switch to renewable energy across the globe.

“I’m certainly excited that remote communities across our country alongside Indigenous climate leaders will be able to share their experiences around the world and help build capacity elsewhere to promote local ownership and help to drive economic development” he said.

Eryn Stewart managing director of ICE said her messaging to policymakers and governments would be to ensure any REM projects leverage the strength of Indigenous land-based wisdom.

“You can have all the technical advisers you’d like but there is really no substitute for local knowledge and community energy champions” Stewart said.

Every community hoping to transition to clean energy should be getting government funds for dedicated positions to facilitate REM projects she added.

“Because when we talk about the SDGs (at COP26) we talk about these big ambitions and goals but on the ground in communities it’s often one person leading those directives and we need to support them.”

Tizya-Tramm finished by saying the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation’s solar project encapsulates the UN Paris accord and the hopes and dreams of his people.

The world faces an existential threat in climate change and Indigenous people around the globe can lead by example with ancient principles of coexistence he said.

And no community is too remote or too small to develop clean energy solutions.

“If my small community can make such leaps and bounds any community can do this” Tizya-Tramm said.

“It’s not too late to return to our communities and empower them” he said.

“It is not too late to create bold and ambitious projects that move us forward — but we must do so together. This is the message of our lands our animals and people.”

(CIAL) is now pioneering another sustainable energy source by venturing into hydroelectric projects and commissioning its own on Saturday November 6.

CIAL has opened its hydropower plant at Arippara near Kodencheri in the Kozhikode district. According to the reports it will generate 14 million units of power for the Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd. (KSEB) and could be operational in full capacity for 130 days in a year Hindustan Times reported.

This comes as a huge sigh of relief at a time when many states in the country are dealing with power crises.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is reported to inaugurate the plant at 11:00 am today.

The CIAL officials called the plant a 'run-of-river' project. It uses the natural downward flow of rivers and microturbine generators to capture the kinetic energy carried by water.

The authorities constructed a weir dam across the Iruvazhinji River hydro-mechanical and electro-mechanical systems at Arippara. This diverts the water to an intake pool from where the water conductor system starts.

Besides working on limited storage of water the plant has no adverse effects on the environment.

""A surge tank was constructed to moderate the water flow during load acceptance and load rejection time. A penstock feeds two machines each of 2.25 MW capacity. A powerhouse with horizontal turbines is installed at the right bank of the river with an installed capacity of 4.5MW"" CIAL said in a statement.

The reason behind this is the new solar cycle that has been activated after an 11-year period. Significantly 3 of these solar flares have been shot towards Earth in just a week. These solar outbursts are known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which could cause power grid fluctuations inconsistencies in satellite orientation radio blackout and even an Internet catastrophe on Earth if they are intensive enough according to scientists.

First solar flare was unleashed on November 1 from a sunspot designated AR2887 and another from sunspot called AR2891 on November 2. The third outburst created the most concern as it was the largest one of the three and came to be dubbed as a “cannibal” - it gobbled up the others. It comprises a complicated magnetic field and compressed plasma particles shot towards Earth with at amazing speeds. The speed varies and the cannibal which was the strongest and fastest overtook and overwhelmed the others.

According to Space.com  all three CMEs have been heading towards Earth and the ""cannibal"" CME reached Earth on Thursday and caused a G3 geomagnetic storm. The recent stunning auroras at lower altitudes are the expected results of this 20-hour long geometric storm. NASA is still evaluating the full impact of the storm on Earth.

What are CMEs?

In simpler terms coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can be understood as the massive solar particle eruptions due to intense flares from the sun. CMEs fire an abundance of plasma gases and magnetic fields out into space often from the Sunspots which are lumps in the Sun's magnetic field.

As CMEs escape the Sun they travel at speeds ranging from less than 250 kilometres per second to over 3000 kilometres per second. CMEs can reach Earth in as little as 15-18 hours which provides very little warning to astronomers and scientists on earth to prepare and warn everyone about it. Fortunately not all solar storms travel as fast and generally take over a day to reach Earth.

Reason behind hustle-bustle of solar flares

According to the experts from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the Sun has begun its 'Solar Cycle 25' which is expected to peak in 2025. Solar minimum occurred in December 2019 marking the start of a new solar cycle the space agency reported.

A new solar cycle changes every 11 years. During this transition of the solar cycle the Sun transforms its nature from relatively calm to active and stormy and then again quiet.

The recent solar storms are the consequences of this new Solar Cycle 25 with the emitted CMEs resulting in geomagnetic storms on the Earth.

According to SWPC the X1-class flare that emitted on October 29 from the sun ended up creating a strong radio blackout for a short span of time across the sunlit side of Earth centred on South America."

We first introduced you to McKinley McConnell 23 the day after the concert.

The Milwaukee-native who now lives in Los Angeles is a die-hard Harry Styles fan. She flew in for his show in Milwaukee and visited her family in Hartford.

She got her mom Linda Bibik a last-minute ticket to the concert and decided to use the event as an opportunity to share some important personal information.

The moment went viral and while much of the attention was on McKinley we reached out to her mom – whose reaction at the concert won the hearts of thousands of people.

It was a moment McKinley and her mom Lisa will never forget. Harry Styles picked McKinley out of the crowd:

Styles - “Do you want to tell your mom?”

McKinley - “Can you tell her? She’s here in the crowd.”

Styles- “What’s her name?”

McKinley - “Lisa”

Styles - “Lisa she’s gay!”

Styles had noticed McKinley’s poster which read: “My mom is in Section 201. Help me come out.”

Lisa knew her daughter had brought a poster but did not know what it said. McKinley decorated the poster at home in Hartford but told her mom not to look that it was a surprise.

Lisa did see the gold glitter around the poster as McKinley made it and she noticed two words written on it: “My mom.” Lisa assumed it said something like “bring my mom down to the pit.” She had no idea the message on it involved her daughter’s sexuality.

“When Harry Styles was starting to read some of the posters in the crowd I was watching on the jumbotron and I could see the gold glitter” Lisa said. “I started saying to all the people around me that’s my daughter that’s her poster!”

Lisa says it took a minute for the message on the poster to resonate because she was so excited her daughter had a personal interaction with her idol Styles.

“Then I got the message and it was just such a beautiful moment” Lisa said. “Ultimately you just want your children to be happy. You want the basic human rights - to be loved and have joy and happiness with whomever they would like. I admire her courage. And to make that announcement at such a positive uplifting event was so memorable. The whole crowd cheered.”

Lisa and McKinley hugged and talked for hours after the concert.

""I'm so blessed to have both my parents be super supportive” McKinley said. “Afterwards my mom just kept telling me how much she loves me and how proud she was of me.""

The Milwaukee Bucks outshined the Phoenix Suns in all of Game 3 and got one step closer to tying the series in the NBA Finals. This win was vital for the Bucks to keep their dream of winning a championship for the first time since 1971. However the stakes to win this series are even higher for the Suns’. They are looking to get the franchise their first title ever. And although they lost Game 3 the Suns’ Chris Paul putting the moves on Giannis in the fourth quarter was the highlight.

The Phoenix Suns trailed almost the entirety of the game as the Milwaukee Bucks offense kicked off with their trio dropping buckets left and right. Phoenix’s consistent lead scorer Devin Booker wasn’t at his best as he finished the night with a meager 10 points.

If it wasn’t for Cp3 DeAndre Ayton and Jae Crowder who picked up the slack the game would have ended in a worse condition. In fact Chris Paul was their top scorer with 19 points and even schooled Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo with his moves.

Giannis who is known to block unexpected bucks couldn’t fathom what Paul was pulling off on him. So the Suns may have lost but they kept their dignity and didn’t let Milwaukee have it too easy.

The Milwaukee Bucks inches away from a tie

As long as Giannis gets support on the offense they have a shot at tying the series in the upcoming game. Unless Booker comes alive in Game 4 and doesn’t let the Bucks get their hands on another win.

Both the teams have a lot to lose but a lot to prove in this series. Being the underdogs they weren’t the top team on anybody’s list to reach the NBA Finals but here they are.

And now while Milwaukee will be looking to end their championship drought the Suns are hoping to create history with their first title.

Will the Suns tank the comfortable lead they got through their first two wins? Or will this just be a lucky night for the Bucks that won’t come again? Only time will tell.

Rebecca and Shane Phillips of California pose in front of their car collection including their new 2022 Ford Maverick. Shane Phillips

Rebecca and Shane Phillips are accustomed to getting looks when driving around California in their 1985 Mercury Colony Park or 1978 Lincoln Continental with longhorns on the front. But the newest head turner in their collection has been somewhat unexpected. ""The looks we're getting are pretty neat. Everybody I've run into they're like 'I've never seen something like this'"" said Rebecca 31. ""It's always fun to drive by and somebody gets surprised about what it actually is and what it looks like."" It's not a classic vehicle sports car or electric vehicle. It's the new 2022 Ford Maverick a small pickup truck that recently went on sale as the automaker's least expensive vehicle in its entire lineup of cars and trucks at about $20000. While the vehicle has only been on sale for slightly over a month Ford Motor says the compact truck – about the length of a Toyota full-size sedan but priced at far less than that and many other smaller cars – is already succeeding in attracting new younger and more cost-conscious buyers like the Phillips'.

""We really are seeing a new customer coming into Ford. And that was really our ambition with Maverick was to appeal to a younger more diverse customer. And we're certainly seeing that"" Todd Eckert Ford truck marketing manager told CNBC. Ford sold more than 4100 Mavericks during the vehicle's first full month of sales in October. Eckert said the company will continue to ramp-up production of the truck at the automaker's Hermosillo plant in Mexico.

Non-truck people

The importance of Maverick isn't just about sales but in attracting new customers to Ford. It may act as a gateway vehicle for customers to step into larger pricier Ford pickups such as the midsize Ranger and full-size F-150. Early Maverick buyers are skewing younger and more female than the traditionally male-dominated truck market according to Ford. Ford said a quarter of the Maverick's buyers are women compared with 84% being male for the full-size pickups according to J.D. Power. The company reports more than a quarter of buyers also are between 18 and 35 years old – double the industry average for that age group. The average age of a new vehicle buyer is 48 according to J.D. Power.

2022 Ford Maverick Ford

The Phillips' said they aren't ""big truck people"" or even new car people but they were attracted to the Maverick because of its price features and fuel economy. It's a similar story for Christopher Molloy II who purchased a Maverick as his first new vehicle in early October. He traded in a compact Chevy Cruze sedan for the pickup. ""I wasn't first looking for a Maverick. I didn't know it existed"" said the 23-year-old Oregonian. ""I was looking for more SUV-type. I wasn't really expecting to get a new truck because they're so expensive until I saw the Maverick was coming out."" Ford surprised many with the Maverick's low price as well as its standard 2.5-liter hybrid engine that can achieve more than 40 mpg during city driving. A Maverick with an optional 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbocharged engine that gets a combined 26 mpg combined including 30 mpg highway and 23 mpg city starts at about $21000. The top vehicles Maverick buyers also look at are other small pickups such as the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger as well as small crossovers and even the Honda Civic sedan according to auto research firm Edmunds.

'Hit the target'

The lower pricing is a welcomed change for consumers as vehicle prices reach record highs of roughly $44000 including a rapidly rising offering of pricey pickup trucks that can top more than $100000. ""In 25 years of being in this business I don't know that I've seen a manufacturer bring a product out that hit the target this well"" said Derek Lee general manager of Long McArthur Ford in Kansas. ""What we are seeing in buyers is a younger buyer. We're seeing first-time car buyers. We are having import car buyers.""

The 2022 Ford Maverick. Ford

The early average price customers are paying for the Maverick is $29749 according to Cox Automotive. That includes dealers and customers selecting higher priced trims and options on the truck. Lee said his dealership has more than 400 Mavericks on order. He said initial demand is the highest he's seen for the store which specializes in larger Super Duty pickups.

Keeping prices low

The Phillips' and Molloy said dealers didn't mark up the price on their Mavericks even though it's a new vehicle and inventory levels at near-record lows due to an ongoing shortage of semiconductor chips. Some dealers who can legally sell a car for whatever price they choose above the manufacturer's suggested retail price or MSRP have been exploiting the low inventory levels and marking up vehicles thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars according to reports and dealer websites. The Maverick hasn't been completely free of markups. Lee said his dealership will not mark up a Maverick if it's ordered by a customer but if someone cancels their order and it goes on the dealer lot they have been pricing them about $2500 over MSRP. ""If a vehicle gets here and somebody turns it down yes we look at what the market is. We still work to be the lowest price in the market"" Lee said. ""I know there's some out there at $5000 over I know there's some out there at $10000 over. We felt like $2500 over was a very very fair price."" Eckert said Ford can't control how dealers price their vehicles but they've communicated to dealers the importance of pricing for this vehicle and its target customers. ""We've talked about the overall proposition and who these cars buyers are and how we want to attract them"" he said. ""They control markup or no markup but we feel like affordability was one of the keys.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb3V0aGJlbmR0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2V2ZW50cy8yMDIxLzExLzA3L2ZvcmRzLXdpbGxvdy1ydW4tYm9tYmVyLXBsYW50LXRvcGljLXRhbGstc3R1ZGViYWtlci1tdXNldW0vNjMwNjIwNzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford's Willow Run Bomber Plant topic of talk at Studebaker museum,"Tribune Staff Report

• From 1 November 2021 Ford Protect service and maintenance plans are unbundled from the purchase price of the vehicle and will be available as an added-cost option.

Ford South Africa has taken a significant decision as it commits to the new Automotive Aftermarket Guidelines. These guidelines more commonly known as 'Right to Repair' came into effect on 1 July 2021 in South Africa and allow independent service providers (ISP) to also service and maintain vehicles.



Effective 1 November 2021 all new Ford vehicles sold in South Africa will not come with a service plan as standard. Instead new owners can purchase it as an optional extra giving them the freedom to have their vehicles services and maintained either at an authorised Ford dealer or with an ISP.

Neale Hill President Ford Motor Company Africa said: ""We are committed to delivering the very best products services and customer experiences and are focused on treating each customer as part of the Ford family. Ford is acutely aware of consumers' growing desire and right to choose where they wish to service maintain or repair their vehicles.""

Warranty remains intact

Though service- and maintenance plans can now be purchased separately Ford South Africa will continue to offer its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) warranty. Every Ford vehicle sold in South Africa will be backed by a four-year or 120 000km comprehensive warranty a three-year or unlimited km roadside assistance and a five-year or unlimited km corrosion warranty.

Hill further adds: ""Customers have the option of selecting where to service their vehicle but it's important that they familiarise themselves with the guidelines. For example if you choose to service your vehicle outside the Ford dealer network while you have a Ford Protect Service Plan in place. In that case Ford is not obliged to pay the Independent Service Providers (ISP) for any services rendered. The ISP cost will be for your own account - and although the Ford warranty remains in place should there be a failure because of the parts used or the workmanship of the ISP that portion of the repair may not be covered by the Ford warranty.""

If new owners do not specify for either a service or maintenance plan as part of their purchase damages and/or mechanical due to vehicles not being serviced according to Ford's applicable service intervals will not be covered by Ford's warranty.

Another aspect that owners should be aware of is that even if they opt against a Ford service or maintenance plan recall repairs should be performed by any one of Ford's 140 dealers across South Africa. Recall repairs are at no cost to the customer.

Hill concludes: ""We have been working to implement the systems and processes necessary to unbundle the Ford Protect service plans. It has taken some time to deal with the complexities of unbundling the service plans from the price of the vehicle but we have now implemented the changes and customers can choose to purchase these separately when buying a new Ford.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdG92cC5vcmcvdG92cC1pbi10aGUtcHJlc3MvYW1iYXJpc2EtcHJhYmh1LWFuZC10aGUtdG92cC1pbi11cy1uZXdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ambarisa Prabhu and the TOVP in US News,"The article below appeared in WUFT News and Public Media for North Central Florida from the University of Florida in Gainesville.

When most people hear the name “Ford” they think of cars. But one heir to the company wanted to change that in his own life.

He’s doing so from his home in Gainesville.

Alfred Ford 71 is the great-grandson of American industrialist and founder of the Ford Motor Company Henry Ford. He was born in Detroit Michigan in 1950 to Josephine Ford the only granddaughter of Henry. That was three years after Henry died in 1947.

The idea of working for the family company never appealed to Alfred Ford as he was growing up even though members of the family such as his grandfather Edsel Ford gave their lives to the business.

“I was always interested in the bigger questions. Who am I? Why am I here? How big is the universe? What’s on the other side of the universe? Who was God? What is my relationship with God?” Ford said.

He said he didn’t hear a lot of stories about his late great-grandfather. However he did know one thing.

“Henry Ford kind of had two different sides to him” his great-grandson said. “One of them was a genius engineer and businessman. And the other one was a searcher after the truth and various religious paths. So I took after that side of it.”

And so Alfred Ford did that by joining the Hare Krishna movement.

The Hare Krishna movement formally known as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was founded in 1966. It now has 500 major centers around the world for its millions of members. According to the official website of the Hare Krishna movement the movement “belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradaya a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts Bhagavad-gita and the Bhagavat Purana or Srimad Bhagavatam.”

Alfred Ford first became interested in the movement when he was 23 years old after seeing devotees chanting on the campus of Tulane University where he studied.

“Immediately the philosophy was very attractive to me” Alfred Ford said.

Two years later in 1975 he was initiated. Compared to his upbringing which included boarding school at age 15 the Hare Krishna lifestyle was very different for him —so much that his spiritual master didn’t expect him to renounce everything.

“He knew that I was accustomed to a certain lifestyle. And when you become a Hare Krishna you don’t necessarily have to give up everything…you utilize what you have to serve” he said. “It’s very simple.”

Now Alfred Ford and his wife of 37 years Sharmila are utilizing the family name to “help push forward the movement” both in Gainesville and abroad. Since 2004 the couple has lived in Gainesville and their two daughters Anisha and Amrita went to Oak Hall School.

One year after he was initiated into the movement Ford had a conversation with the founder of the Hare Krishna movement His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in Detroit. They talked about Prabhupada’s plans to build a big temple in Mayapur which is the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu an incarnation of Krishna.

Ford said the conversation planted a seed in his heart to take up the challenge. But it wasn’t until 2009 that construction started on the Sri Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir – Temple of the Vedic Planetarium. As chairman of the project Ford has had to deal with several challenges over the years such as a lack of cooperation from the communist government in West Bengal and more recently the pandemic.

“I put in quite a bit of seed money and that got the project off the ground” he said. “I’m one of the people driving the agenda there so it’s been a wonderful adventure.”

Despite all of the delays and difficulties Ford hopes the temple opens by 2024 or 2025.

“Where I see the opening as being is when the deities which is a form of Krishna that is in the temple that we offer our worship to when they’re moved into the new temple from where they are now I will consider that to be a grand opening” Ford said. “I’m looking forward to that.”

Although Ford said most of his attention and energy is focused on the construction of the temple in India he and his wife have stayed connected with the local Hare Krishna community in North Central Florida which is one of the largest in the U.S.

“I just think that this community is wonderful Gainesville and Alachua” Ford said. “The people here are very fortunate to have such a wonderful temple and so many devotees that are doing outreach. If I was growing up here I would feel very lucky to have so many opportunities to become enlightened.”"

A few hours later the 82nd Airborne would take up the Marines’ forward positions allowing Ghost Company to fold into the terminal. And finally the 82nd Airborne would fall back to the airport to waiting planes ending America’s longest war.

The Emmy-winning series ended in 2010 after eight seasons and a TV movie but of course that wasn’t the end of the franchise. The sequel series 24: Live Another Day brought Jack Bauer back in 2014 and the spinoff 24: Legacy aired for one shortened season less than three years later.

1. 24 co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran hashed out the 24-hour premise at an IHOP.

2. Originally the duo imagined 24 as a romantic comedy depicting the 24 hours before the wedding.

3. The writers considered ditching the real-time format sometime after Season 1. Of course they never did with writer Virgil Williams telling The Observer that changing the format “would be like killing Tony Soprano.”

4. The CTU headquarters shown in the 24 pilot are actually the offices of Fox Sports and the show’s set designers recreated the space on a soundstage once the series was picked up.

5. Sarah Clarke won the role of Nina Myers moments before she started filming and so the clothes she wears throughout Season 1 are the clothes she wore to her audition.

6. Cast members had to get their hair trimmed every five days to maintain visual continuity for their characters.

7. Sutherland injured his leg stepping out of his trailer on set so 24 writers gave Jack a shrapnel injury in Season 2 to account for the actor’s real-life limp.

8. The cougar Kim Bauer encounters in Season 2 actually bit actress Elisha Cuthbert. “It almost ripped my thumb off” she told WENN. “I was rushed to the hospital with two puncture wounds one of which went right through my hand.”

9. Fans who dialed a phone number shown on screen in a Season 4 episode got a chance to talk to 24 crew members and stars—including Carlos Bernard Reiko Aylesworth and Mary Lynn Rajskub.

10. Sean Astin landed the role of Lynn McGill in Season 5 after crossing paths with co-creator Joel Surnow at a chiropractor’s office. The chiropractor introduced the duo and Surnow offered Astin a part on the spot.

11. The late Sen. John McCain had a cameo in Season 5 handing a document folder to Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) in one split-screen scene.

12. 24 ranked as the longest-running American espionage TV show by the time it ended in 2010.

13. Producer Brian Grazer tried to get a 24 feature film off the ground for years. “We couldn’t find the right location we couldn’t find the right story and it was always too expensive” he later explained to Deadline.

14. 24 begat the sequel series 24: Live Another Day and the reboot 24: Legacy but two other planned spinoffs—a Jack Bauer prequel series and a real-time legal thriller—never achieved liftoff.

15. The show did however spawn a mobisode series—24: Conspiracy starring Orphan Black’s Dylan Bruce—and a webisode series The Rookie starring The Bold and the Beautiful’s Jeremy Ray Valdez.

16. 24 is the only Fox series to have won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series once taking home the award in 2006.

17. According to a fan tally Jack Bauer has said “Damn it” 145 times over the course of the series. Of the times he has directed the swear at a person Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) is the most frequent subject of his ire.

18. After he heard that 24 fans had made a drinking game around the “Damn its” Sutherland littered one particular episode with the catchphrase. “By the end there had to be 14 ‘Damn its” he told Rolling Stone in 2006. “And I could just see all these college kids going ‘Oh f–k!”

﻿

19. Fans have calculated that Jack killed 309 people over the show’s nine seasons including 52 in Season 6 alone.

20. In 2006 amid controversy about the show’s torture scenes U.S. Army Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan then the dean of the United States Military Academy at West Point and three military and F.B.I. interrogators met with 24 producers to express concerns about those scenes’ impact on viewers and cadets according to The New Yorker.

21. The Council on American-Islamic Relations called out 24 for “anti-Arab and anti-Muslim themes” in 2007 noting that the show had shown Jack Bauer battling Arab-American and Muslim-American villains for three out of its first six seasons.

22. Actress Cherry Jones said on Fresh Air in 2020 that she “compromised” herself by starring as President Allison Taylor on 24 explaining that she took the role to get more time with her ailing parents than her Broadway roles would allow. “I do have a great deal of trouble with violence but I sold my soul for that one for the time with my parents” she added.

23. Janeane Garafolo who starred as Janis Gold in Season 7 alleged on a 2013 podcast episode that 24 co-creator Joel Surnow “wanted Cherry Jones to play the president that season as a slam to Hillary [Clinton].” But the plan backfired she added because “the fans loved Cherry Jones as the president.”

24. And speaking of actors with bad memories of the show Freddie Prinze Jr.—who played Cole Ortiz in Season 8—said he “hated every moment” of filming 24 and wanted to “quit the business” afterward. “Kiefer was the most unprofessional dude in the world” he told ABC News in 2014. “That’s not me talking trash I’d say it to his face. I think everyone that’s worked with him has said that.”"

The crowd at the gate didn’t know it but the Marines had been told to close it at 6 p.m.

That left just 30 minutes for Capt. Geoff Ball 33 commander of 2nd Battalion 1st Marines’ Ghost Company to pluck out a few more people with that elusive combination of affiliation and luck that would get them onto a plane out of Afghanistan. Just 30 more minutes for Cpl. Hunter Lopez 22 to grab another child out of the sewage canal where hundreds jostled. Just 30 minutes for Capt. Andres Rodriguez 31 to scan the crowd for men who fit the descriptions in dozens of text messages from people in the United States trying to save their interpreters.

The plan for the final “retrograde” of the American war in Afghanistan was clear: On Aug. 26 the British troops stationed at the nearby Baron Hotel would fall back. A few hours later the 82nd Airborne would take up the Marines’ forward positions allowing Ghost Company to fold into the terminal. And finally the 82nd Airborne would fall back to the airport to waiting planes ending America’s longest war.

And those 20 years have not always been kind on the Fox action drama as you can see below.

Premiering on November 6 2001 just weeks after the September 11th attacks 24 followed Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) as he and his colleagues at the fictional Counter Terrorism Unit saved the world from terrorist plots over the course of 24 hours with the action playing out in real-time across 24 episodes a season.

The Emmy-winning series ended in 2010 after eight seasons and a TV movie but of course that wasn’t the end of the franchise. The sequel series 24: Live Another Day brought Jack Bauer back in 2014 and the spinoff 24: Legacy aired for one shortened season less than three years later.

Now it has raised $100 million to fuel its growth a round of funding that values H2O.ai at $1.7 billion post-money ($1.6 billion pre-money).

This is a Series E round and it’s being led by a strategic backer the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) which has been a customer of the startup and will be using the backing to kick off a deeper partnership between the two to build new services. Others in the round include Goldman Sachs Pivot Investment Partners Crane Venture Partners and Celesta Capital. Further plans for the funding include building more products for H2O.ai as a whole and hiring more talent to continue expanding the company’s H2O AI Hybrid Cloud platform.

This is not the first time that a customer has led a round as a strategic backer: in 2019 Goldman Sachs led the company’s Series D of $72.5 million. As a sign of how the company has been growing and the general appetite for what it does H2O’s valuation has leapfrogged since that last round when it was valued at $400 million per PitchBook data. Mountain View-based H2O.ai has raised $246.5 million to date.

The fact that both of the last rounds have been led by big banks that are also customers of H2O.ai’s speaks a lot to where the opportunity has been for the startup. Sri Ambati the founder and CEO (who previously was also a co-founder of Platfora which was acquired by Workday) told me over email that about 40% of the company’s revenues currently come from the very wide and all-encompassing world of financial services.

“Retail banking credit cards payments — almost every payment system from PayPal to MasterCard are customers of H2O” he said. On the equities side companies power fixed income asset management and mortgage backed security services using H2O’s technology with MarketAxess Franklin Templeton and BNY Mellon also “strong” customers he said.

That is also seeing a growing complement of business from other verticals he added: Unilever Reckitt P&G are among those in consumer goods; UPS is one of its users in logistics and delivery; Chipotle is among those in food services; and he said that AT&T “is one of our largest customers.”

Covid-19 has had a role to play here too.

“Manufacturing became a fast-growing vertical due to supply chain disruption and demand sensing” he said of the pandemic. “We launched H2O AI Health to help our hospitals and providers payers like Aetna and pharma customers.”

Notably H2O.ai is also now breaking ground into working more with other tech companies that want to build more AI into their own workflows to in turn provide services to their own customers. “Our latest wins are in vertical clouds and SaaS ISVs” Ambati said.

The company has offered an open source component to its services which it calls simply H2O from its earliest days and that is now used by over 20000 enterprises. Part of the reason for that is its flexibility: H2O.ai says that its open source framework works both on top of existing big data infrastructure on bare metal or on top of existing Hadoop Spark or Kubernetes clusters and is able to ingest data directly from HDFS Spark S3 Azure Data Lake or any other data source into it’s in-memory distributed key-value store.

“Our open source platform gives freedom and ability for customers to build their own AI centers of competence and excellence” Ambati said of the open source tools. “We are like the Tenzing Sherpas of the AI mountains helping our customers to traverse and conquer AI peaks.”

That framework can be used by engineers to build customized applications while H2O.ai’s proprietary tools provide more completed applications in areas like fraud detection churn prediction anomaly detection price optimization and credit scoring — areas that can benefit from the ingestion of massive amounts of data in order to gain better insights into what might happen next: these sit either as a complement to what human analysts and data scientists might be able to unearth or potentially in some cases as a replacement for the more basic work they might do. In all there are currently some 45 applications in all.

The plan Ambati said is to over time build out more of these which will reside in “app stores” in specific verticals offering a range of its proprietary pre-built tools particular to the demands of each of them.

The trend fueling H2O.ai’s growth has been gaining momentum for several years now.

Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for the world of enterprise IT: used well tools like machine learning natural language processing and computer vision can speed up productivity or even open up completely new areas of opportunity for an organization. Over time it can save companies billions of dollars in operational and other costs.

One big issue however is that in many cases organizations might lack the internal teams to build or carry through projects that use AI and that’s before considering the fact that as needs and parameters evolve all of that infrastructure will need updating too. Technology touches everything in an enterprise these days but not every enterprise is a tech company.

H2O.ai is not the first or only startup that has aimed to fill this gap in the market although it seems to have managed its task a little more successfully than others.

Notably Element.AI out of Canada was built out on the back of a large amount of funding and buy-in from big tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia also to address the idea of democratizing AI for the wider world of enterprises that might lack the resources to build and run AI tools themselves but could very much benefit from them before their businesses simply get cannibalized by the many AI-fuelled tech companies moving into their spaces. It had a strong focus on integration (it was a little like an Accenture for AI services) but never managed to make a big enough jump from concept to business and was eventually acquired in 2020 by ServiceNow to complement its own efforts to build tools for businesses.

Ambati said that only about 10% of H2O.ai’s business is in the area of services with the remainder 90% coming from its products as an explanation for why one startup’s approach worked while another did not.

“It is easy to get lured by services in data science and AI” he said. “Being true to our product maker culture and yet building deep customer empathy and listening is critical to success. Customers experience our maker culture and become makers themselves. We are continuously making our software easier (democratizing) low-code reusable recipes and automation through AI Cloud and building data pipelines AI AppStores and delivering AI as a service that our customers can use to improve their customer experiences brands and communities.

“The big difference — we are raising a forest not just a tree. H2O AI Cloud H2O Wave our low-code Application Development H2O AI AppStores Marketplace and H2O-3 Open Source ML are at the core of AI Applications and software already and we are partnering with customers and their ecosystem of partners and developers.”

That’s a play and business resonating well with investors too

“Commonwealth Bank has a significant asset in the millions of data points collected every day. AI already has helped us to improve our customer experience however we know there is untapped potential to do more” said Matt Comyn CEO of CBA in a statement. “The investment in and strategic partnership with H2O.ai extends our leadership in artificial intelligence and ultimately boosts the bank’s ability to offer leading digital propositions and reimagined products and services to customers.” Dr. Andrew McMullan chief data and analytics officer at CBA will join the H2O.ai board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi90aGUtbmVlZC10by1oYXZlLXNraW4taW4tdGhlLWdhbWUtc2ViaXMtbmV3LXJ1bGUtZm9yLWFtY3MtMTA0ODIyNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The need to have skin in the game: Sebi's new rule for AMCs,It is a moot point whether the new rules were introduced as a fallout of the Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund saga which incurred the wrath of investors when it decided to shut down six of its debt schemes in April 2020. There were also allegations that some employees of Franklin Templeton AMC had redeemed their personal investments in these schemes before they were wound up. Way back in 2014 the SEBI had introduced the concept of seed capital by which all AMCs had to invest a minimum of 1% of the amount raised in their own schemes subject to a ceiling of Rs 50 lakh. The rationale was that when the fund house itself had a stake in its schemes it would feel the pain of investors when the fund didn’t do well and a stake in the schemes ensured that fund managers would manage the funds more responsibly. Subsequently in August 2021 the SEBI asked fund houses to invest amounts ranging from 0.03% to 0.13% in their own schemes depending on the risk level removing the ceiling of Rs 50 lakh which meant that AMCs had to increase the net worth beyond the requirement of Rs 50 crore. Though analysts and other players feel that the new rules may result in a flight of talent from AMCs to insurance companies or broking houses where these rules don’t apply SEBI’s move should be lauded as it aims to protect the interests of investors.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvZGFpbHkuY28udWsvMjAyMS8xMS9iaXR0b3JyZW50LWFuZC10cm9uLWFubm91bmNlLWJzYy1pbnRlZ3JhdGlvbi1mb3ItY3Jvc3MtY2hhaW4tc29sdXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BitTorrent And Tron Announce BSC Integration For Cross-Chain Solution,"Table of Contents

Tron and BitTorrent have announced the integration of the Binance Smart Chain to their cross-chain scaling solution BitTorrent Chain (BTTC). The Binance Smart Chain will be one of the first public chains in the BTTC ecosystem and will focus on bringing cross-chain features to users.

Facilitating The Exchange And Circulation Of Cross-Chain Assets

The integration of the Binance Smart Chain into BTTC will help to facilitate the exchange and circulation of cross-chain assets for users on both ecosystems. BTTC users will be able to transfer assets between the Binance Smart Chain and other public chains that have been integrated.

The integration of chains like the Binance Smart Chain into BTTC will also help to streamline the interaction between TRON and BTT users and the cross-chain DeFi ecosystem. This will facilitate a smoother exchange of data and value.

The BTTC Protocol

BTTC is the first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol in the industry today. The protocol has been developed by the core teams of TRON and BitTorrent and utilizes a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and multi-node validation. It also supports off-chain matching and extension of smart contracts through the use of smart chains.

BTTC boasts of features such as fast and cost-effective transfers asset security and a heterogeneous cross-chain structure. Speaking on the Integration between BTTC and the Binance Smart Chain TRON founder Justin Sun commented

“The BitTorrent Chain (BTTC) provides a scaling solution for mainstream blockchains around the world. This will enable heterogeneous cross-chain communication that is decentralized and free of trust. It is safe to say that the integration BTTC in the BSC ecosystem marks TRON’s first stride towards an era of cross-chain interoperability.”

An Impressive Surge

Data suggests that the TRON ecosystem has seen significant growth in recent times with the numbers backing the data. The public-chain users on TRON have exceeded 58 million users. This increase in users has pushed up total transactions beyond 2.5 billion with the total locked value (TVL) surging past $11.5 billion. TRON has also become a leading player in decentralized applications DeFi GameFi and NFTs and has the largest circulating supply of stablecoins globally.

Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem Lead Coordinator Samy Karim commented

“Tron and BitTorrent teams have a huge following from the crypto as well as mainstream tech/crypto audience. With this integration millions of BitTorrent and Tron users can access the NFT GameFi and Infra projects building on BSC while BSC users’ can interact with dApps building on top of the Tron network.

Well like your cell phone it’s packed with as many features as possible to manage a variety of data collection and information sharing tasks all while communicating with your pocket computer in almost any way you want it to. There are heaps of clever functions included in the Garmin Enduro and we will focus on the ones that affect trail riding herein.

Fit and tactile functionality

On the all-day fit front this watch is cozier than its large body might suggest. It weighs 71g with the feathery nylon band and there’s a titanium version that drops weight by 10g for an extra $100. The Garmin Enduro retails at $800 for the steel version I tested ( sold at REI and other online retailers) or $899 in titanium that weight savings better feel significant. It’s not far from the heft of the Polar Grit X we reviewed last season that hit the scale at 64g. When you chillin’ at home or walking about the size and feel of the watch is easy to get used to.

Out on the trail that added mass strapped to your wrist may require a longer adjustment period. I have dainty wrists and most larger watches end up bruising and cutting me while bouncing about on the trail. This one was no different. If I ride with gloves or put it under the cuff of a tight long sleeve jersey it’s usually okay. Without gloves the front of the watch will cut through and cause bleeding by the end of the first long descent no matter how tight I strap it. I tried it on the underside of my wrist as well to no avail. As long as I have gloves on the cuff keeps the watch from shimmying forward and cutting me rendering this a non-issue. The watch also stayed in one place better once there was sufficient sweat under it. I let a larger-boned friend borrow the Enduro to make sure this wasn’t just my issue and they also ended up with a bloody wrist at the end of the trail.

That little added weight makes for a tough watch that should outlast several bands and multiple software updates. The steel bezel and Power Glass lens are going to be hard to break. I didn’t manage to scratch them despite a few long slides down the trail. The display is easy to see under sunlight and there’s a button on the top left to light it up on night rides. The two buttons below that toggle through functions and there’s a main selector switch and backup button on the right side. The backside of the watch is smooth and clean and I haven’t had any issues with trail detritus becoming logged in the charging port. There’s a small solar panel that wraps close to the bezel to increase battery life and a larger one behind the display that also takes in a little light.

The ultralight strap can be swapped out for something more substantial if you prefer and a stickier material might help with the movement issue mentioned above. It’s comfortable and easy to put on and take off with velcro closures on either side that surprisingly stay closed on the trail.

Trail riding and training

Battery longevity is possibly the brightest shining corner of the Enduro. If you’re using it solely as a watch it will last between 50 and 65 days depending on solar conditions. Garmin says that number can bump up to 130 days in battery saver mode. The battery life stays high at 70 to 80 hours with all of the data reading meters turned up to ten and the saver mode will more than double that duration.

In addition to daily rides at home I took the Garmin Enduro on a few work trips to the Alps recording daily rides and didn’t plug it in once. In fact I didn’t even pay attention to the battery whereas I would have to charge most other devices almost daily. It also recorded a long slog over the Via del Sale route on the French/Italian border with a twelve-hour pedal followed by a ten-hour day and didn’t manage to dent the battery life. If you’re into massive bikepacking or adventure-racing sorts of fun this watch can record it for you.

Wayfinding on those long adventures is clearer and simpler with the Garmin Enduro than it has been with similarly capable and costly smartwatches I’ve tested. The easiest method I’ve found for loading a track is to download the file on a phone or computer slide it into the Garmin Connect software and then sync the watch. Bingo the file can then be selected and followed from start to finish.

Similar to Garmin’s handlebar-mounted computers the Enduro will share turn-by-turn directions along the route and sound an alarm if you take a trail that’s not part of the planned route. You can also route back to the start or stop using the file if you find a better direction to steer the ride. As ever the breadcrumb map display is tricky to follow if you’re in a tight knot of trails where one track may be too close to another to know if you’re in the correct spot. Fortunately those sorts of trail systems often braid back together at some point and it may not always matter if you’re on the correct singletrack. Outside of those trail-pretzels the watch is easy to follow and the audible alerts are helpful when you don’t want to look down to see if you’re on track.

The range of data you can view while riding with this watch is extensive and impressive. There are a number of metrics around elevation heart rate speed time power and HR data wayfinding temperature interval data heading and too many others to list. For general riding I find it helpful to keep one page with most of what I want to see: total ride time distance total ascent and current elevation. Those cover what I want to know while out on the trail and I can look at the other data when I arrive warm at home. I keep other pages that display the time of day heading and temperature but I only toggle between them when out on a longer exploration where I need to keep track of daylight and to see if the temp has changed or if it’s just my blood sugar level that’s creating cooler feelings.

All the typical sensors and trackers are included in the Enduro and you can connect any sort of power meter or egg-timer your heart desires. The pairing process is quick and simple with no need for a computer science degree to manage it. The built-in heart rate monitor (HRM) functions as well as most of them which is to say that it’s a bit spotty and takes some time to start displaying data. Part of the lag might be due to the dark tattoos on my wrist though my ink-free friend who tried the watch had a similar experience. It can take between five and fifteen minutes for the watch to start displaying beats and that could be frustrating if you’re on a quick lunch ride and need to do intervals at a specific heart rate. I did have better luck with the HRM once my wrist became sweaty and wetting it first seems to have some effect on the initial performance. Pairing the watch with a chest-strapped beat-meter may speed up the process which is the case with most smartwatch heart rate monitors. Garmin says that the Enduro also measures heart rate underwater though I didn’t get a chance to test this variable beyond a few fast dips in cold lakes.

Additional features

Apart from cycling the Enduro can track nearly any sport or activity you participate in or you can create a profile for whatever new game you’re into. There are heaps of built-in data tracking features for the usual suspects of running golf swimming lifting hiking and countless others. Need to track your stats for single-footed beer-pong jousting? You can likely find a way. You can also have a look at your sleep patterns and rest intervals both of which can make for a more effective training plan.

The altimeter can let you know how fast you’re ascending or descending and paired with a reading of your blood oxygen level you can calculate when you might want to rest during a high altitude hike or pedal. On the pressure side the barometer can also help with storm alerts which will come in handy during long backcountry excursions when you can’t check the forecast.

Of course you can pair the Enduro with your phone to receive all manner of text messages and calendar alerts if your life requires that. You can also change songs on your phone pay for things with GarminPay and use the “find my phone” or “find my watch” features to locate your stuff. I tested the alerts briefly and they all work great. I then promptly turned them off as my life allows for distraction-free time in the forest. I do leave the movement remainders turned on so I remember to throw some pushups between typing paragraphs. My colleagues might appreciate it if I set up some meeting reminders in there…

Data analysis software

Garmin Connect ride analysis software is well known by most riders so I won’t belabor the finer points. There are two cool elements for mountain biking that I occasionally enjoy perusing after that hot post-ride shower.

The Flow score tells you how well you maintained speed over a given section of trail. This can be a cool variable to compare across a few laps of the same track. If you’re working to improve braking or cornering technique or both the Flow score is there to evaluate just that. It uses a scale where a Flow score of 0-1 is considered a smooth ride 1-20 is within the moderate Flow scale and everything above 20 is a rough ride. This analysis can provide a cool way to get faster since you have to brake less and generally ride smoother to improve it. While your overall time may not be faster you will know where the lost time sits.

Another trail-specific analysis variable is the Grit score. This is a measure of how much climbing and undulation happens over a ride creating a metric for how difficult one trail is compared to another. This could help riders evaluate the most physically challenging trails in a given system and compare them. It could also help with recovery by allowing you to see if a trail is as difficult as it felt or if you are due for a rest.

As with any ride analysis software Garmin Connect allows you to link and share your ride files wherever you like or to load rides you would like to check out in the future. You can set the account public in case your coach or riding buddies need to see your data as soon as you hit save or you can keep it private and share a link with them when you wish.

Summation

The Garmin Enduro smartwatch fits under an umbrella that has the phrase “top-level trail tools” scrawled across its arched waterproof material. Apart from the initial skin abrasion it fits and functions exceedingly well and the few faults it has don’t entice me to swap it for another. Folks who are into other sports will likely love the versatility and functionality that goes beyond two wheels and trails and it works great for riding or racing mountain bikes. While it is an expensive piece of gear it’s also wicked tough and should last for a lot of years. If you crash with it on you don’t have to fret over breaking it or losing it in the bushes like a handlebar-mounted unit which might make the high cost a little more palatable. If you have the funds for a watch that will do it all this may be the one for your wrist.

Research shows that dips in temperature cause your body to make subtle adaptations; blood vessels and arteries narrow the heart and lungs work harder. An animal study from Northern Arizona University found this response helps to develop the muscles' aerobic function which in normal people's parlance means they're able to receive more oxygen during exercise.

Test subjects experienced a 34% increase in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and an impressive 29% increase in running speed over distance after sustained exposure to cold temperatures – a result the scientists expect could extend to your own cardio sessions too.

Which makes a winter spent braving dark mornings a worthwhile pursuit. Add to that the fact that training when it’s Baltic lightens the burden of seasonal affective disorder while also boosting your immune system to guard against colds and not only will you be training more effectively but more consistently too.

It's not cheap though for a non-smart offering and the resistance lever has a really plasticky cheap feel to it.

The Boost is the only non-smart turbo trainer in the Tacx lineup but should you have your own training plans to follow outside the online training apps – yes you can use this trainer on Zwift and so on but more about that in a minute – then you can't really go wrong with it. This is one very easy-to-use turbo with a stable footprint.

The setup is simple and takes about 10 minutes. All you have to do is fold out the legs to stand the frame up then locate the roller mechanism with one of three grooves on the frame – which one depends on your wheel size. Once everything is lined up all you have to do is fit two bolts using the included hex key.

In the box you'll find a specific quick release lever. Switch it for your standard one locate the bike between the mounting points and push the lever down to lock everything in place. Engage the roller and you are good to go.

When you're finished folding the legs down makes it quite a compact unit and at just over 9kg it's plenty light enough to place in the car for race day.

Also in the box is a front wheel riser to level your bike up which is good to see – it's often an added expense. One thing you will have to pay for is an adaptor if your bike uses thru-axles though which will set you back about £25.

For changing through the ten levels of resistance you get a cable-operated lever that clamps to your handlebar.

In use it feels really cheap and plasticky. It's not so bad when dropping to a higher resistance as it easily clicks into place but the force involved in shifting through to easier settings sees it flex a fair bit. It needs clamping tightly too or it keeps slipping round the bar.

The resistance levels give plenty of range up to 1050 Watts at an effective speed of 40km/h according to Tacx although I didn't use the upper levels that much unless I was planning some full-on efforts.

The magnetic brake and 1.6kg flywheel give a smooth feel and the Boost's secure stance means you can really crank things up in the saddle without it becoming overly jerky or feeling unnatural.

Like most turbos its rigid design means it isn't really suitable for hard out-of-the saddle efforts or sprints though.

It's reasonably quiet. There is the usual whine with everything spinning which gets louder the faster you're going but it is certainly not unbearable for people in nearby rooms unless you have wooden floors or similar surfaces that transmit the noise.

Bundle of fun

The Boost is also available as part of a £250 bundle which adds Garmin's Speed Sensor 2 – this attaches to your wheel hub to give you speed and distance for your workout.

When connecting to Zwift you can get it to search for the speed sensor and then when given the option of saying which trainer you're using you can select the Boost from the drop-down list. Zwift will recommend you use resistance level 2 on the trainer. This way it will work out a virtual power figure for your ride.

I personally don't have a power meter at the moment so I couldn't check out how well it works but various internet sources say it's relatively close to real power for steady-state efforts.

Value

The Boost on its own is £229.99. That's pricier than something like the Elite Novo Force turbo which is a magnetic unit though the Elite only offers five resistance settings and lacks a front wheel riser block.

Saris' Mag+ Trainer is closer to the Boost at £199.99 though again there is no front wheel riser.

If you're thinking about using the Boost for Zwift and so on it might be worth paying the extra £50 (just £30 over the bundle price) to get Tacx's own Flow Smart trainer. That's £279.99 and my review is coming soon.

Conclusion

If you want the versatility of a standard turbo trainer you can use away from the home/power supplies the Boost is a good choice – especially for those pre-race warm-ups.

It's not the cheapest but it is very well made – that lever aside – and delivers a stable platform and smooth operation. You also have the smart capability should you want to add it by way of the sensor.

Verdict

At the pricier end of the scale but worth it for the smooth road-like feel and stable platform",,,,,,

The 23-year-old was killed last week in a crash involving now ex-Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs III on Rainbow Boulevard.

Sunday’s gathering was held at St. Simeon Serbian Orthodox church on Jones Boulevard where a person close to the church says funds were collected for Tintor during a fundraiser to help with funeral costs.

Those who knew Tintor also held a candlelight vigil last week after Tuesday’s crash.

“She was only 23 years old” said Mary Vogle a former co-worker. “Didn’t even live half her life. And now it’s gone — taken away senselessly.”

Those who knew her say she was witty and always there with a joke to boost everyone’s mood.

“Every time I look back and think about her I just see her smile and I see good times” said Ryder Hankins who worked with Tintor in the past. “We would laugh in the check stands together. The unbearable eight-hour shifts — we would laugh and it would feel like nothing because she was there.”

According to a new Gartner report in fact 56 per cent of users said new software had made them wish management would bring the old system back.



The findings showed that 81 per cent of software users have taken some kind of action - positive or negative - after a notable experience with software.



""The democratisation and consumerisation of IT has resulted in employees who have more discretion over what software they use and how they use it"" said Craig Roth research vice president at market research firm Gartner.



""Software product leaders often focus on adding new features to keep up with competitors but this leads to overly complex products with poor user experience (UX)"" he noted in the report.

Nearly 40 per cent of users have resisted using applications after a negative experience by using minimal features avoiding or delaying use.

After a positive experience with an application however 41 per cent of users spent more time delving further into its features.

""Consumption of new features helps technology providers increase the stickiness of a product but when users ignore advanced features vendors have less influence to secure upsells or renewals and stay ahead of competition"" said Roth.

The report also found that users frequently share their opinions on software with peers with IT and with business leaders either proactively or in response to requests for input.



Social media is also becoming an important outlet for sharing opinions on software with 10 per cent of respondents indicating they had left reviews on social media or review websites after a negative experience with an application.



When users were asked what actions software vendors could take to make them more likely to recommend their products to peers IT or business leaders the top answer was to make products easier to use cited by 51 per cent of respondents.



The report also found that 34 per cent of users said their IT department allows them to choose most of the software they use.



""In some instances users may also self-acquire software through personal or business credit cards or users will be billed based on consumption although these arrangements are not yet commonplace"" it added.",,,,,,,,,

The 2016 U.S. Olympian typically a slick boxer outfought tough aggressive Maiva Hamadouche on the inside to win a unanimous decision and unify two junior lightweight titles Saturday in Las Vegas.

The scores in the 10-round bout — 100-90 99-91 and 98-92 — don’t tell the story of the entertaining battle. Mayer (16-0 5 KOs) had to dig deep.

“[I showed] I could bang it out on the inside” he said. “That wasn’t really the entire game plan. The game plan was to use my jab but in the back of my head I knew she was going to keep it close keep me on the inside. Even though we trained for that just being able to do that for 10 straight rounds taught me a lot.”

“This is everything I trained for. It really hasn’t even sunk in but I’m proud of what I did. I’m proud of my team. We’re going to celebrate this one for sure.”

Mayer said she also finds gratitude in proving her doubters wrong.

“I really wanted to show everyone in the division and the naysayers that I didn’t have the power and the grit to stay in there for 10 rounds with Hamadouche that I am the best in the division” she said.

Hamadouche (22-2 18 KOs) had won 13 consecutive fights since she lost a decision to Delfine Persoon in 2015. The Frenchwoman was making the seventh defense of her IBF belt.

Mayer was making the second defense of her WBO title. She is now setting her sights on the other 130 pound champions Terri Harper (WBC) and Choi Hyun-mi (WBA).

“I am coming to be undisputed” Mayer said “and I want the big fights. I’m definitely a threat.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL2d1bGZuZXdzLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydHMvZWxlY3RyaWMtcGxhbmVzLXRha2luZy1vZmYtZnJvbS0xLXNlYXRlci10by0xMDAtcGx1cy1wYXNzZW5nZXItcGxhbmVzLXdpdGgtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbnMtMS4xNjM2Mjc2OTk5MzMw0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZm5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydHMvZWxlY3RyaWMtcGxhbmVzLXRha2luZy1vZmYtZnJvbS0xLXNlYXRlci10by0xMDAtcGx1cy1wYXNzZW5nZXItcGxhbmVzLXdpdGgtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbnMtMS4xNjM2Mjc2OTk5MzMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric planes taking off: From 1-seater to 100-plus passenger planes with zero emissions,This website stores cookies on your computer.

He’s not a doctor; he’s an engineer. When he joined the company it was focused on developing a device to treat high blood pressure and later hypertension but those ideas have long since been thrown out the window.

But Yared has been a steady pilot for the company along the way. Its signature product is Barostim Neo an implantable device that uses neuromodulation to treat heart disease. When it was still private it raised approximately $400 million in equity and debt more than most other Minnesota startups.

Before joining CVRx Yared worked for Medtronic and GE Healthcare two of the largest players in the industry. He brings a global perspective to business. A native of Lebanon he grew up there during the nation’s civil war in the 1970s and ‘80s. He earned his engineering degree in France. And he speaks three languages: Arabic French and English.

In 2018 the company was on the brink of shutting down after disappointing clinical trial results. Yared and other company leaders didn’t see any other option at the time. While the company often drew headlines for its prolific fundraising the story of the company’s near-collapse is not well known.

“We had three plans: plans A B and C. All three plans were shutdown plans” recalls Yared.

Instead the company unexpectedly went with Plan D: It survived. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration received new clinical trial data on May 1 2019 and granted approval to the Barostim Neo System on Aug. 16. “The data basically spoke for itself” says Yared. The company went public in late June netting approximately $133.3 million in proceeds.

Looking back at the company’s long road to get where it is today Yared says “Medical discovery is not always a straight line.”

When the company pivoted from hypertension to heart disease did that concern your investors?

One of the things I learned is the importance in selecting the right investors in the company from the get-go. I think that’s the most important thing. The importance of the investors is often ignored. That money that you raise from the Series A or the seed money will influence the life of the company forever.

We were blessed at CVRx in having very solid investors. New Enterprise Associates [NEA] is a large venture fund and they actually invested in the incubator that started CVRx and led or co-led every single round of financing since the inception of the company over two decades.

In 2007 we added Johnson & Johnson Innovation—that’s the venture arm of J&J—to become an investor and they also were very solid backers of the company. They also led or co-led every single round of investment with NEA since 2007.

When we made that decision—which road do we take hypertension or heart failure?—the company was already well funded. In 2008 we raised $84 million and in 2007 we raised $65 million. By 2011 we still had a solid balance sheet.

Have you received any good advice that helped you run the company?

One of my board members early on was Dale Spencer. Dale is a legend in the cardiovascular space. He created SciMed [which] was sold to Boston Scientific. He was on the board of CVRx for many many years. He guided me along the way.

Plus John Nehra from NEA early on. He’s still on our board; he is our lead director. Those two influenced me a lot early on as a young CEO running CVRx.

What guidance did they offer?

Let me take the example of John Nehra. One of the [pieces] of advice he gave me early on as an entrepreneur is to raise the money when I don’t need it. When you need the money you go to raise it and you’re desperate. The investors know that. That’s a bad situation.

Plus the money goes through cycles. Sometimes there’s a lot of money sitting on the sidelines; sometimes there is not. That cycle could be very different than the cycle of your company whether you need the funding or not. Many CEOs worry about the dilution effect of raising money when you don’t need it. “What if I don’t need this money? Why would I raise it now?”

John Nehra’s advice for me was “Take the money when it’s available not when you need it.” That has helped and saved the company over the years multiple times. Not once or twice—multiple times.

How did that work for the company?

We had just raised the money in late 2007 from J&J—$65 million. In 2008 we had not yet started spending this money. We were still spending the money raised prior to that. Somebody knocked on our door and said “I would like to invest in CVRx.”

We still had $65 million that we had not spent. At the end of this exercise we end up raising $84 million closing that round in July 2008. In Minneapolis I was labeled as the “stupid CEO” who washes out and devalues everybody. August 2008: economic crisis. September 2008 everybody wanted me on a panel to talk about how smart I was to raise money in July when I did not need it.

In October 2008 it would have been impossible to raise the money.

Totally.

How about advice that you haven’t followed?

I got some bad advice over the years. The bad advice was “Never ask the FDA any questions because you may get the answer you don’t like.” That’s one of the worst [pieces] of advice I received over the years.

Not only ask the FDA but go and share your business plan with the FDA. Tell them where you’re strong tell them where you’re weak tell them your challenges tell them the constraints around which you are working because they will try to understand how the choices they are making on their end could make the difference between day and night for you as a CEO of the company.

By all means: Ask FDA ask FDA and ask FDA. If you don’t like the answer ask them again.

Was doing an IPO for the company always the plan?

It was always one of the plans for the company for sure because funding from private funds will become limited over time. There’s a finite amount of [venture fund] money available … for small companies medtech companies. And after a while you start building a commercial organization that requires a lot of funds. It’s harder and harder to do this from private funds.

Do you find Minnesotans wary of becoming investors?

I’ve seen many entrepreneurs based in Minnesota struggling much more than entrepreneurs based in the Bay Area and Boston. On one hand I look at it favorably that we’re able to raise money from outside of Minnesota to be invested mostly in Minnesota. But if you want the medtech industry to stay vital in Minnesota we need to have a stronger VC community in Minnesota—no question about it.

What is the hardest thing about being a startup CEO?

The hardest thing is always to say no. Your crew comes up with so many ideas yet your resources are so limited. You have to stay focused on what you can do.

That’s probably the hardest thing. Now along the way you will face some really gut-wrenching moments. Letting people go because you’re running out of money is very hard. But I think the hardest is still saying no because you are faced with that decision every single day.

It sounds like you’ve seen some challenges.

In the fall of 2018 we thought that we failed our clinical trial. We thought “This is it. This is the end of CVRx.” [We made] a decision to reduce our cash burn to be able to survive for a little longer to understand what was going on and we laid off about two-thirds of the company.

We also had to communicate to physicians and patients in the trial that the trial was unlikely to meet its end point. As a CEO I have a friend of mine that I just fired. … I have investors who trusted us and I’m telling them “Hey this is not working.” That is difficult but those situations happen maybe once in a lifetime.

As CEO you feel lonely and insufficient when this happens. You feel like an entire world is against you between the regulators and the customers and patients and employees and investors. And you’re trying to keep the lights on despite all of it.

Obviously you didn’t go out of business. What happened?

In 2018 … in the data there was one end point that was not going correctly so it was basically neutral not statistically significant. The FDA I informed them that this is basically a failure in the trial and we don’t have a choice other than shutting down the company.

To their credit the leadership of the FDA asked us to not rush. They said that they’ve seen situations like this in the past and there are ways that we could recover from it. That recovery was difficult because we had to figure out a way to do it without wasting too much time.

Luckily for us we had the second cohort of patients that was reaching maturity in six months that we could use as a second trial basically. That second set of data in April 2019 was very very good and that led to a very fast approval of our product in three and a half months.

How did you find the process of the IPO?

The process of going through an IPO is long and exciting and at the same time tiring. It goes from the due diligence working with a couple of law firms four banks and so forth to doing investor meetings day after day after day … it’s not easy.

It’s very exciting to see how many people are interested in our story and in the product and the company that we’ve built. I was actually happy with the process. Now we’ve raised the funds that we need to continue building the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvaHVkLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3dqbjE2MzQzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Caruso Obituary - The Journal News,"Give to a forest in need in their memory

GEN,Gen Digital,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvZGlnaXRhbGZvdW5kcnktMjAyMS1ob3ctd2VsbC1kb2VzLWd1YXJkaWFucy1vZi10aGUtZ2FsYXh5LWhvbGQtdXAtb24tbGFzdC1nZW4tY29uc29sZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How well does Guardians of the Galaxy hold up on last-gen consoles?,"Guardians of the Galaxy left a great impression after our tests on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The game itself is simply terrific and genuine highlight of 2021 - but equally obvious is that the Dawn Engine is demanding on console hardware. All of which raises the question: just how do the last-gen machines cope with the game? In a world where PS5 and Series X struggle to maintain 1080p60 in performance mode can any PS4 or Xbox One machine deliver a good experience?

Obviously there are going to changes from the current-gen console experience - so the option to choose between a 30fps quality mode and a 60fps performance alternative is off the table. It's 30fps and that's your lot similar to Xbox Series S. Reducing resolution as well as frame-rate is another obvious way that Guardians of the Galaxy can scale: so the base PS4 renders with a dynamic resolution range of around 900p to 972p while Xbox One drops down to 720p (DRS is a possibility here but all counts came in at 720p curiously). Owing to the temporal anti-aliasing in play the lower the resolution goes the less distinct the picture is but it's still a good-looking game: only hair and fur elements genuinely suffer.

Moving onto the enhanced last-gen machines Xbox One X is a genuine surprise with a huge increase in image quality - as you would expect from a 1440p-1890p dynamic resolution range. Image clarity is massively improved and those telltale hair and fur artefacts are far less of an issue. It was also good to see that texture quality anisotropic filtering shadows and even draw distance are improved over the base Xbox One. PS4 Pro also guns for 4K with a similar DRS range to Xbox One X the difference being that the dynamic pixel count is usually lower.

At this point it's worth updating our analysis on PS5 and Series X quality modes which also run at 30fps - it is indeed native 4K for the vast majority of play but DRS drops to 1800p can happen. More interesting is the developer's choice to peg Series S to 1080p30 - a curious choice bearing in mind that both PS4 Pro and Xbox One X look significantly cleaner owing to their higher pixel counts. Series S is a generation ahead and yet any close-up of hair or fur shows One X in particular delivering a huge advantage resolving sub-pixel detail. However perhaps predictably resolution isn't the whole story. In fact despite the lower pixel count Series S pushes higher visual settings. Shadow quality is marginally improved on the newer machine and most noticeable is a texture quality boost on Series S - a curious state of affairs bearing in mind the lower rendering resolution.

There are other questions to answer too - if we assume that PS5 and Series X offer two times (or more) more GPU power than the last-gen enhanced machines how come rendering resolutions are relatively close? The answer here is predictable: graphical quality is more impressive. Texture quality is greatly improved draw distances are pushed out shadow quality is better and geometric density is also greatly improved. Foliage physics are also included on the new consoles perhaps tapping into the extra CPU power available.

There's also the matter of performance to consider - there are genuine problem here on the base last-gen machines. Bottom of the barrel is the base PlayStation 4. Even with its 900p-972p dynamic resolution frame-rates struggle in cutscenes and combat where we can drop as low as 20 frames per second. Exploration is fine but any time the action heats up the game clearly has issues. Bearing in mind how each new battle introduces a new mechanic a new Guardian or more skills - like elemental rounds - it's sobering to see it gets progressively worse. Xbox One also has issues but it looks like its locked 720p resolution offers less aggressive drops to performance. All round Xbox One tackles most areas better than the vanilla PS4 but it is still far from ideal. The image quality the hitching the geometry pop-in - it's all still a serious blight on the experience.

However if you're gaming on Xbox One X Guardians of the Galaxy holds up admirably delivering performance similar to Series S overall - it's essentially a 30fps lock though there are some obvious streaming hitches from time to time when moving between areas or during camera changes in cutscenes. It has one-frame dips sporadically - while the worst cutscenes drop briefly into the high 20s. Again this is not ideal but it's a huge improvement over the other last-gen editions. There's not much more to say here except that it's impressive One X pulls this all off at a higher resolution than Series S. Insofar as the last-gen versions go this is the one to get and it's very playable.

PS4 Pro is a game of two halves: on the one hand it's an enjoyable 30fps experience in battle holding that performance level during most exploration stages too. On the other hand there are moments in play and cutscenes which inexplicably drop to the 20s. PS4 Pro is best described as a mixture: again it's very playable and image quality is creditable. You can think of it as a similar experience to Xbox One X only with a slightly less stable frame-rate in cutscenes and odd moments.

At this point we've covered all seven console versions of Guardians of the Galaxy and the bottom line is that PS4 Pro is the 'minimum console spec' we can recommend for playing the game smoothly with Xbox One X the preferable choice from all the last-gen machines. Both enhanced consoles get you a reasonable 30fps performance level with a crisp image that sits well on 4K displays. They both miss out on the higher-grade detail foliage textures shadows and physics of the PS5 and Series X - but they really do a decent job. With the base consoles you'll have to tolerate regular drops to 20fps - especially on PS4 - with a significant hit to resolution too where Xbox One comes out worst at 720p native.

Final thoughts: it's clear that Guardians of the Galaxy's engine is demanding on console hardware but bearing in mind the turnout on PS5 and Xbox Series X it was surprising to see how well Xbox One X and PS4 Pro handled the game. It's a brilliant release and if you're still gaming on either of those machines you'll still get a good experience. My last thought? Given the showing of Xbox One X hopefully the developers will offer up a higher resolution upgrade for Series S - it may not have the raw horsepower and bandwidth of the Scorpio Engine but 1080p30 does seem like a cut too deep for the junior Series console.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDY5MjU1MC90aW5kZXJzLW5ldy1zd2lwZS1uaWdodC13aG9kdW5pdC1wb2ludHMtdG8tdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1zaGFyZWQtZGlnaXRhbC1leHBlcmllbmNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tinder's new 'Swipe Night' whodunit points to the future of shared digital experiences,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90692550/tinders-new-swipe-night-whodunit-points-to-the-future-of-shared-digital-experiences/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDY5MjU1MC90aW5kZXJzLW5ldy1zd2lwZS1uaWdodC13aG9kdW5pdC1wb2ludHMtdG8tdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1zaGFyZWQtZGlnaXRhbC1leHBlcmllbmNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9za3lyaW0tYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktZWRpdGlvbi1wcmljZS1uZXh0LWdlbi11cGdyYWRlLWNvbmZpcm1lZC1iZXRoZXNkYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Skyrim: Anniversary Edition Pricing And Next-Gen Upgrade Confirmed By Bethesda,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9za3lyaW0tYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktZWRpdGlvbi1wcmljZS1uZXh0LWdlbi11cGdyYWRlLWNvbmZpcm1lZC1iZXRoZXNkYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvYmFua2luZy9maW5hbmNlL2EtdW5pcXVlLXNvbHV0aW9uLXdvbWVuLWxlZC1kaWdpdGFsLXBsYXRmb3Jtcy1sb29rLXRvLXRhcC1mZW1hbGUtaW52ZXN0b3JzL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg3NTU5MzQ3LmNtc9IBnAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvYmFua2luZy9maW5hbmNlL2EtdW5pcXVlLXNvbHV0aW9uLXdvbWVuLWxlZC1kaWdpdGFsLXBsYXRmb3Jtcy1sb29rLXRvLXRhcC1mZW1hbGUtaW52ZXN0b3JzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NzU1OTM0Ny5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A unique solution: Women-led digital platforms look to tap female investors,"A unique solution: Women-led digital platforms look to tap female investors

Demand for generators has soared as more people work from home. The crew from left are Ryan Ballinger Bryan Callaghan and John Phillips. Read more

Joseph Schwartz and his family live in a wooded part of Upper Providence Township near Ridley Creek State Park where they say power outages occur too frequently for comfort. Without power his family also loses water and sewer service because their private well and wastewater system rely on electric pumps.

So last winter Schwartz decided to install a standby generator that would automatically power up seconds after Peco Energy’s electric service cut out. The decision to buy an expensive generator system turned out to be the quickest part of the process.

The market for standby power generators has soared in the last year driven by the pandemic which suddenly made power interruptions more than a minor inconvenience for millions of families working from home. Severe storms such as Hurricane Isaias in 2020 also drove up demand. Manufacturers confronted with supply-chain disruptions were unable to keep up with orders. Schwartz was told that delivery of a new unit would take many months.

“The lead times are pretty shocking” said Schwartz a building contractor who is familiar with supply-chain interruptions that have also challenged his industry. “That’s really what’s happening right now. The whole supply chain is so spotty.”

Schwartz went ahead and put down a deposit on a 20-kilowatt Briggs & Stratton generator from All Phase Electric Co. a dealer in Upper Darby. The unit finally arrived and was installed seven months after he placed the order.

Such delays are par for the course these days said John Phillips a generator specialist for All Phase Electric. His firm sells Briggs & Stratton and two other generator brands -- Kohler and Generac. All manufacturers are experiencing delays in deliveries of new units he said. Some replacement parts are also back-ordered.

“We’ve been waiting for one particular item from one of those manufacturers for like eight or nine months now” said Phillips. “So if it’s not a high-volume product or they get some piece of that from some far-off land there’s no telling how long it will take to deliver.”

The story is the same with other dealers.

“If I was to place a new order for generators they’re shipping in August 2022 like 10 months out” said Sharon Torrisi president of Power Watch Systems Inc. a Montgomery County dealer of Generac units. Business is booked so solidly that Torrisi’s family-owned firm is now scheduling installations of in-stock generators for next April.

A standby generator is different from a portable power generator which is a smaller device that needs to be manually fueled and connected by an extension cord to electrical systems. A standby generator is an engine housed in a box about the size of an air-conditioner condenser permanently installed outside a house. They are linked to a fuel supply like natural gas or propane and wired directly into a house’s circuitry through a transfer switch. They turn on automatically in seconds if utility power cuts out and stay on until utility power is restored.

Customers who have installed standby generators say it gives them peace of mind when the power fails.

“Every time the generator comes on I want to go out and kiss it” said Diana Gross a retiree in Fort Washington who has multiple sclerosis. She and her husband John had a Cummins generator installed in June 2020 when the lead time for an installation was about a week.

Standby generators are not an inconsequential purchase. They often require a building permit. Because the engines emit deadly carbon monoxide they need to be positioned away from windows. The zoning in some towns requires them to be located away from property lines because they can be noisy.

Two years ago the price of a typical installation cost $10000 to $12000 said Torrisi whose firm is based in Eagleville. Those prices have increased about $2000 she said because manufacturers are charging more and the cost of installation has climbed driven by surging demand.

Higher prices do not seem to have deterred sales.

“The convergence of the heightened power outage activity broader electrification trends and people spending more time at home has driven unprecedented demand for home standby generators” Aaron P. Jagdfeld chief executive of Generac Holdings Inc. told investment analysts Tuesdayafter the Wisconsin company reported third-quarter earnings. Generac accounts for about 75% of standby home generator sales in the United States.

Jagdfeld said Generac sales were up 34% in the third quarter “in spite of significant operational obstacles faced across the supply chain environment.” He said Generac dealers are making three times more home sales calls this year than in 2019. The company which has two factories in Wisconsin just opened a third plant in South Carolina.

Last year Quality Electric Service a Generac dealer in Woodbine Cape May County installed 150 standby generators in its territory which ranges from Cherry Hill to the Jersey Shore said Brian Ploe a partner in the firm. The year before it did 90. It’s on pace this year to surpass its sales from last year.

“The lead time for installation was about 12 to 14 weeks for orders placed early last year” Ploe said. “The lead time today is 38 to 44 weeks for the same generator. I’m telling customers if you want one and you’re serious give us a deposit today and we’ll do everything we can to get you installed in about 10 to 12 months.”

Dealers say they received an influx of inquiries in September after Tropical Storm Ida as they always do after big storms though some prospective buyers had only seen infomercials that advertise standby generators starting at $1999 (that’s for a small unit uninstalled). One dealer said installation costs regardless of the generator size are about $6000.

“Well you definitely see an increase in call volumes when a storm hits” said Torrisi. “But the owner here used to say `If they call on a sunny day then they’re a real buyer.’”

Ploe the New Jersey dealer said the demographic of potential buyers has changed. Before the pandemic he said 95% of the firm’s customers were older than 55 and they were concerned about security and comfort.

“Midsummer of 2020 we started noticing it was families with young children who were buying which was always a really hard market for us to break into because of their incomes” Ploe said. Younger people working from home or teaching their children were worried about lost income and lost school days he said.

He said the long lead time for a dealer-installed unit has caused some buyers to order a standby generator delivered from home-improvement stores or online sellers which the dealers discourage. “Now you’re stuck with a 500-pound box in your driveway right?” said Ploe. “What are you gonna do with it?” If the unit is damaged or improperly installed the manufacturers will refer the owners to a qualified dealer for warranty work he said.

“It’s a dangerous thing to introduce generated power and utility power” said Chris Caniglia the owner of All Phase Electric. “We’ve done probably hundreds of thousands of dollars of repairs of work by unqualified contractors who went in and did a $10000 generator for eight grand.”

After exploring the costs many customers may find that the price of a standby generator is not justified by the frequency and duration of power outages.

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission says that the number of major storm events has been trending ever higher in recent decades -- three of the highest storm totals since 1993 have occurred in the last four years. The number of customers affected each year by the storms has increased over that time.

But the average American household experienced about 7.6 hours without power last year when major storm events were included according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In Pennsylvania the average was 5.9 hours and in New Jersey hit harder by summer storms interruptions averaged 15.7 hours per customer.

In the hardest-hit state hurricane-prone Louisiana customers averaged 72 hours without power last year -- three days.

Occasionally a generator’s return on investment is very quick.

Debbie Foster commissioned All Phase Electric to install a Kohler generator at her Bala Cynwyd home last summer less than a day before a massive storm swept through the area. “It was almost comical because they put in the generator and within 13 hours we had a power outage and the neighborhood was out for like three days” she said. Foster has referred so many friends to All Phase that the firm gave her a year’s service for free she said.

All utility customers do not experience outages equally. Many households in sparsely populated heavily wooded areas may find that they experience more outages and longer restoration times than the average customer. Other customers such as those with medical conditions have a low tolerance for even brief outages. Torrisi said her firm has installed generators for several physicians who practice telemedicine from home for whom every outage is a big imposition.

Torrisi believes that a standby generator elevates a house’s resale value and some developers are including them in new builds. “If the house has a backup power generator that makes it more appealing like a swimming pool” she said. Some customers have told her they got a discount on homeowner’s insurance because their sump pumps would keep their basements dry during an outage.

But many say the benefits are hard to measure in dollars and cents.

“We probably lost power last week twice just for no reason on a sunny day maybe for an hour” said Schwartz the Upper Providence builder who spent $16000 to install the propane-fueled generator at his home. “It’s definitely a First World problem. But if you have the ability it’s a great add-on.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Michael Wettlaufer Commander Military Sealift Command; Capt. James White Milk's civil service master; Todd Gloria Mayor San Diego Rep. Susan Davis (ret); Dr. Jen Campbell San Diego Council President; Anne Kronenberg activist and Milk’s former campaign manager; members of the Harvey Milk Foundation and members of the LGBTQ+ community.





The ship honors Navy veteran and LGBT activist Harvey Milk one of the first openly gay candidates elected to public office as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978. He was assassinated On November 10 1978 (10 months after he was sworn in) by fellow City Supervisor Dan White. Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 for his activism. USNS Harvey Milk is the first ship named for an openly gay person.“The secretary of the Navy needed to be here today not just to amend the wrongs of the past but to give inspiration to all of our LGBTQ community leaders who served in the Navy in uniform today and in the civilian workforce as well too and to tell them that we’re committed to them in the future” Del Toro said noting that Milk resigned his commission and discharged from the Navy for being gay. “For far too long sailors like Lt. j.g. Milk were forced into the shadows or worse yet forced out of our beloved Navy. That injustice is part of our Navy history but so is the perseverance of all who continue to serve in the face of injustice.”""My uncle never dreamed of having a ship or a street or a park or a school named after him"" said Stuart Milk Harvey's nephew and the keynote speaker at the ceremony. ""What we celebrate today is that the Navy honors the difference between tolerance and acceptance.""The 746 foot Milk is the second ship in the new John Lewis-class previously known as the TAO(X). This class of oilers has the ability to carry 162000 barrels of diesel ship fuel aviation fuel and dry stores cargo. The upgraded oiler is built with double hulls to protect against oil spills and strengthened cargo and ballast tanks and will be equipped with a basic self-defense capability including crew served weapons degaussing and Nixie Torpedo decoys and has space weight and power reservations for Close In Weapon Systems such as SeaRAMs and an Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System. The Lewis-class of oilers will replace the current Kaiser Class fleet replenishment oilers and they age out of the MSC fleet.“A Navy veteran and tireless advocate for equality and universal rights having Harvey Milk as the namesake for this ship as she adds to our Nation’s strategic advantage in agile logistics is absolutely awesome!” said Wettlaufer. “With enhanced capabilities in storage and delivery of fuel and cargo Harvey Milk will support our Navy in the away game as we keep our country safe far from home and protect the sea lines of communication. Important to our economic vitality and assuring allies and partners this ship will help promote freedom of access to international seas and the rules based international order that has sustained the peace over the last 70 years.”Speaking before breaking a bottle of champagne across the ship’s hull the ship’s sponsor Paula Neira Clinical Program Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender Health and a Navy veteran said ""When Harvey Milk sails she'll send a message both domestically and around the globe to everybody that believes in justice and freedom and liberty that there is a place for you in this family.""Following the traditional champagne christening Milk slid down into the water with its horn blowing streamers flying and music from the Navy Band Southwest playing.Five more Lewis-class oilers are on order for the Navy.

It is the second ship for the U.S. Navy’s John Lewis-class fleet oiler program.

General Dynamics NASSCO press release

Mr. Stuart Milk nephew of the ship’s namesake and Co-Founder and President of the Harvey Milk Foundation served as the principal speaker at the ceremony in addition to remarks from NASSCO and U.S. Navy representatives.

U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Paula Neira Navy Veteran and Clinical Program Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender Health were the ship’s sponsors. Prior to launching the 742-foot-long ship down the ways Ms. Neira christened the ship with the traditional champagne bottle break alongside the hull.

“We are justifiably proud of every ship we build but this one is special because of her namesake. Today we are honoring Stuart’s lifetime of selfless service his hope for equality and a world without hate” said David Carver president of General Dynamics NASSCO. “On behalf of the 35-hundred employees of General Dynamics NASSCO I am proud to present the future USNS Harvey Milk for christening.”

Former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus declared the John Lewis-class of oilers be named after leaders who fought for civil and human rights. The second of six ships honors Harvey Milk human and civil rights activist who dedicated his life advocating for equality.

“Leaders like Harvey Milk taught us that diversity of backgrounds and experiences help contribute to the strength and resolve of our nation” said Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro. “There is no doubt that the future Sailors aboard this ship will be inspired by Milk’s life and legacy.”

General Dynamics NASSCO picture.

In 2016 General Dynamics NASSCO was awarded the contract by the U.S. Navy for the detailed design and construction of the next generation of fleet oilers the John Lewis-class (T-AO 205). The contract calls for the design and construction of six 742-foot-long oilers with a full load displacement of 49850 tons. Designed to transfer fuel to U.S. Navy carrier strike group ships operating at sea the oilers have the capacity to carry 157000 barrels of oil a significant dry cargo capacity aviation capability and up to a speed of 20 knots. The John Lewis-class ships will replace the current T-AO 187-class fleet replacement oilers.

“The christening of the USNS Harvey Milk marks another historic milestone in the history of our Navy and our country. Harvey Milk’s words and actions brought hope and inspiration to many for whom our nation’s lofty rhetoric of equality and inclusion were not yet reality” said ship sponsor Paula Neira. “Today while we must continue to carry on his work and much work still needs to be done by christening and launching this ship we honor his legacy celebrate the progress that has been made in advancing diversity and inclusion for so many and we know that wherever the USNS Harvey Milk will sail she will bring that message of hope and inspiration to present and future generations.”

In addition to the christening of this ship two ships in the T-AO class fleet oiler program for the U.S. Navy –the future USNS Earl Warren (T-AO 207) and the future USNS Robert F. Kennedy (T-AO 208) – are currently under construction. The lead ship the future USNS John Lewis (T-AO 205) was launched earlier this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzA2L25hdnktbmFtZXMtc2hpcC1nYXktcmlnaHRzLWxlYWRlci1oYXJ2ZXktbWlsa9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Navy names ship in honor of gay rights leader Harvey Milk,"Share on email (opens in new window)

The Navy on Saturday christened and launched a ship named for slain gay rights leader Harvey Milk. Why it matters: Milk served four years in the Navy during the Korean War as a diving officer before he was forced out.

He went on to become one of the first openly gay candidates elected to public office when he joined the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. The following year he was assassinated alongside San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.

What they're saying: Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Milk's nephew Stuart Milk attended the ceremony in San Diego.

“For far too long sailors like Lt. Milk were forced into the shadows or worse yet forced out of our beloved Navy” said Del Toro per AP.

“That injustice is part of our Navy history but so is the perseverance of all who continue to serve in the face of injustice” Del Toro added.

The big picture: The Navy’s Military Sealift Command will operate the USNS Harvey Milk which is the second ship in the Navy's John Lewis class of fleet replenishment oilers which serve to refuel Navy ships at sea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL3N0dWRlbnRzLWFyZS1wdXNoaW5nLXVzLWNvbGxlZ2VzLXRvLXNldmVyLXRpZXMtd2l0aC1taWxpdGFyeS1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWNvbXBsZXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Students Are Pushing US Colleges to Sever Ties With Military-Industrial Complex,"The violence wreaked by U.S. wars since 9/11 has been immense — more than 929000 total deaths including an estimated 380000 civilian deaths. And the U.S. has spent a staggering $14 trillion in Pentagon expenditures since the Afghanistan War in 2001 up to one-half of which went directly to defense contractors like Boeing Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman General Dynamics and Raytheon.

While these facts are outrageous they aren’t surprising in a country built on colonial violence — a country whose power and expansion are derived from war-making with such militarism being grounded in every institution arising from the state including education.

Students and young people are witnesses to the ways in which the U.S. education system is deeply complicit with war and militarism and in increasing numbers we are demanding change. As student organizers with Dissenters — a national movement that is building local teams of young people across the country and mobilizing to reclaim our resources from the war industry reinvest in life-giving institutions and repair collaborative relationships with the earth and people around the world — we were part of a weeklong effort at the end of October in which students at 16 campuses across the country rose up to unite around three central demands: 1) Universities must divest all holdings and cut all ties from the top five U.S. war profiteers: Boeing Lockheed Martin Northrump Grumman Raytheon and General Dynamics; 2) All cops off of all campuses; 3) All recruiters off all campuses.

Such a statement lies at the heart of Dissenter’s organizing and the Dissenter’s overall “Divest from Death” campaign which helps students mobilize against any war-making institutions their schools may be invested in. In fact U.S. colleges and universities are complicit in lining the pockets of war profiteers and overall defense contractors. Colleges like American University award lucrative board positions to war profiteers like Wesley Bush the former CEO of Northrop Grumman; and just this February a $75 million donation from major shareholders of General Dynamics — the Crown Family — was approved by the University of Chicago’s newly renamed Crown Family School of Social Work Policy and Practice. Meanwhile hundreds of other U.S. universities continue to renew contracts with U.S. defense companies to fund and fuel internship programs arts and cultural buildings on campus and to maintain a steady STEM-to-war pipeline at the nation’s top engineering schools.

With the clear stake that U.S. institutions have in perpetuating endless war it’s no wonder that young people at colleges across the country are rising up to demand our schools sever ties with the military-industrial complex.

The rising momentum of antiwar organizing among students was especially apparent on Oct. 25-31 during the Dissenters Divest from Death Week of Action as young people from Chicago to Washington D.C to California to Hawaii explicitly centered humanity over profit by disrupting “business as usual” at their institutions through direct action.

Students Fight Investment in Militarism

On October 11 the University of California Berkeley (UC Berkeley) sent out an email to its student body proudly claiming that its city was one of the first to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day in the United States and asking students to research and acknowledge the land we are on to honor the day. All the while the University of California and CalTech have received upwards of $300 million to build the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project located on Mauna Kea Hawaii. – a project that has been actively opposed by Indigenous Hawaiian protesters. Mauna Kea is a sacred place and to build a large telescope on top of it would be a desecration. While protesting the construction of TMT on their land Indigenous Hawaiians including elders have been met with arrests by settler-state police and threats of even greater violence including the calling in of the National Guard. Where is the honor in ignoring and trampling over the calls being made by Indigenous Hawaiians to put a stop to the development?

Hawaii Dissenters (@hawaiidissenters)

Now more than ever UC Berkeley students are building coalitions with organizers throughout Hawaii as they fight to protect Mauna Kea from TMT. However they are not the only university contributing to the construction of TMT. In fact Punahele Kutzen a student organizer of Hawaii Dissenters in Manoa emphasizes that while the University of California is a full partner in the construction of TMT “so many universities are direct profiteers of this desecration” including the California Institute of Technology and Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) associate schools like Johns Hopkins Yale and more.

Student organizers involved with the Hawaii Dissenters in particular have continued to make their resistance to such funding and imperialism known against this construction as well as various other forms of desecration on Hawaiian land. During the Divest from Death Week of Action Hawaii Dissenters’ main focus was on highlighting the climate imperialism resulting from the U.S. military’s ongoing occupation of Hawaii.

Students and young people are witnesses to the ways in which the U.S. education system is deeply complicit with war and militarism and in increasing numbers we are demanding change.

Stressing the imminent threat to the water supply and ecosystem by the Navy’s underwater missile testing and fuel tanks Hawaii Dissenters directly confronted military officials and settler state politicians about their role in Red Hill — a military fuel storage facility in Hawaii.

Conducting a community teach-in titled “Red Hill 101” as part of a coalition of O’ahu-based Water Protectors Hawaii Dissenters also made public comments at last week’s Red Hill Task Force Meeting in which they challenged the military and state’s claims of national security as justification for poisoning O’ahu waters and overall Hawaiian land. Beyond their week of action Kutzen clarifies that Hawaii Dissenters are “continuing to plant pilina [relationship or union] and build connections with folks from the ground up connecting with ʻĀina [the land] as we fight for genuine security.”

In Chicago students at University of Chicago have been fighting a different battle against their institution’s direct investment within militarism and destruction. University of Chicago Dissenters spent their week of action partnering up with #CareNotCops and other student organizations to protest Paul Alivisatos’s inauguration as president of UChicago.

“President Alivisatos may be a new face but he is beholden to the same donors billionaire trustees” said a representative of #CareNotCops who wished to remain anonymous.

Alivisatos proposed 10 “vectors and culture of engagement” for his new direction of the University — but none of them promises true change.

“The vectors do not denounce UChicago’s active role in domestic militarism through CPD and the University of Chicago Police Department where ‘engagement’ is the harassment and surveillance of our Black neighbors and peers. Nor do they address UChicago’s role in international militarism — in fact these ‘vectors’ only mention an expansion of UChicago’s investment portfolio which currently includes four of the five largest weapons manufacturers in the country (Boeing Lockheed Martin General Dynamics and Raytheon) and other war profiteers” said the representative.

History shows us that “elite” U.S. schools like UChicago do and will — without apology — displace and demolish whole swaths of Black neighborhoods fund warfare and deforestation through investing multibillion-dollar endowments bust unions steal wages force out disabled students and sexual assault survivors send cops to shoot those in crisis harass Black neighbors with private police forces and more as it suits its financial interests.

“That’s why we want the university to divest precious money and resources from the UChicago Police Department and invest in funding #EthnicStudiesNow #CulturalCentersNow and #ReparationsNow for the South-Siders whose lives have been affected by university expansion” said Nico Emmanuel-Henderson a Dissenters organizer at UChicago.

Students Fight the Revolving Door Between the University and the Military

Besides direct investment in funding and research to war-making institutions universities have other insidious ways of ingraining militarism in the school structure. Most prominently these include recruitment to military and policing programs like the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) which often have a major presence on our campuses. Programs like the ROTC often offer students money in grants and scholarships — or even payment of future scholarly endeavors — if they were to sign up. Such promises ensure a steady stream of college students — who too often struggle to pay for outrageous tuition on top of the other crucial resources like books food rent and more — to participate in and perpetuate violent militarism and oppression.

Moreover recruitment looks like universities making space for weapons-manufacturing companies to scout out potential employees on campuses both formally and informally. At schools like Howard University (HU) Lockheed Martin is especially prominent and has been targeting Howard’s Black student population to “diversify” its own team and staff. In other words the company is searching for Black computer science engineering and business majors — science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) students — to contribute in doing the work of militarism and oppression.

We won’t stop until we turn the tide against war and militarism.

But when we consider this horrific STEM-to-militarism pipeline it leads us to the important question of who is behind such recruitment strategies and what stakes they have in militarism. Too often higher-ups at universities who approve or even advocate for programs that benefit militarism have a deep connection and thus fealty to war-making and militarism.

American University Dissenters (@audissenters)

American University (AU) most recently approved Wesley Bush — former CEO of the weapons-manufacturing company Northrop Grumman — to the Board of Trustees in January 2021 leading to a school-wide campaign against him. For their Divest from Death Week AU Dissenters organized a “trick or treat” canvassing event to garner more signatures on their petition to remove Bush from their Board and orchestrated a banner drop within the School of International Service — the most renowned department at American University. On top of on-campus organizing AU Dissenters dedicated this week and beyond to standing in solidarity with Howard University students organizing the Blackburn Takeover. In fact for almost a month now HU students have been protesting their hazardous dorm living conditions– including mold roaches and vermin– by occupying their Blackburn Student Center. Students’ list of demands include a meeting with the Howard administration full academic disciplinary and legal immunity that student rights to vote for the Board of Trustees be reinstated and a legitimate housing plan. As temperatures continue to drop and with the Howard administration continuing to antagonize them student protesters rely on outside sources for food encampment materials and things to keep warm. For the week of action AU Dissenters was able to raise enough money to purchase a generator for them and are making weekly supply runs for students at Blackburn “for however long it takes.”

AU students are making strides in their organizing and have even caught the attention of other administrative members. In fact in response to students sending letters for Bush’s removal American’s University’s current president (and former Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Obama administration) Sylvia Burwell sent an email to students about Bush’s presence on the board saying “Members of the Board of Trustees represent a wide range of backgrounds and experiences all of which are critically important for advancing the university’s mission. Wes Bush’s extensive experience in the corporate and philanthropic sectors will augment the board’s efforts and contribute to our work and our community.”

Burwell is right about one thing: Board of Trustees members play a crucial role in advancing the university’s missions. In fact the Board of Trustees is a critical structure in university administration as it controls the development of the school’s overall objective school policies and how money can be used to implement these programs and policies. In other words the Board of Trustees handles where students’ money goes and how that money is used. So when the board has vested interests in war and militarism we must recognize how this can and does take precedence over the needs of students attending the university.

Mya Franklin a member of Northwestern University’s chapter of Dissenters emphasized this in a statement made during the Divest from Death Week of Action: “Divesting from militarism is deeply personal because there are people on the Board of Trustees at Northwestern that have not only the power but the ability to provide services like stipends for low-income students expansion of CAPS [Counseling and Psychological Services the school’s primary mental health service] viable avenues to support survivors of [sexual assault] but they don’t. Instead they are actively fueling death and destruction.”

Northwestern University Dissenters / @wearenudissenters

The Board of Trustees members Franklin is talking about include Phebe Novakovic the former CEO of General Dynamics as well as Dennis Muilenburg whose developments as the former CEO of Boeing include creating weapons used by the Israeli military to massacre Palestinians. Northwestern Dissenters were quick to call this out in their week of action doing a banner drop and flyering their Research and Technology building with posters reminding students of how these board members and the institution as a whole are actively fueling death and destruction.

The work to purge university administrations of war criminals isn’t easy. After all these are powerful individuals whose connections and resources can be weaponized to terrorize all opposition — even if they are young students. And with these profiteers being well-integrated (and monetarily beneficial) to the internal administrative structure universities will do anything to protect them. Most of the time this includes harassing and surveilling students on campus.

As a member of the American University Dissenters I (Ngakiya Camara) personally recall instances of being surveilled on campus and have been agitating against AU’s practice of doing nothing to protect Black students on campus while simultaneously doing everything to protect Wes Bush.

Meanwhile Mya Franklin of Northwestern Dissenters recalls being harassed by Northwestern University Police Department (NUPD) officers while doing the banner drop and flyering stating “Someone ripped down one of our posters as it was drying. [A] NUPD pig pulled up and harassed us. That morning we all acutely experienced militarism as we were fighting for anti-militarism.”

So long as universities are prepared to prioritize the role of war criminals on our campus over the livelihood of their students these instances will persist. And as long as powerful war profiteers occupy crucial administrative positions like the Board of Trustees resources meant for students will be used to strengthen the lucrative ties that these profiteers have to the institutions they worked for and are invested in. But even in the face of powerful war profiteers we will not be silent.

Our universities which boast to be hubs of progressiveness and inclusivity partner with the very same death institutions that perpetuate imperialism and settler-colonialism. From their direct investments in research for colonial constructions like TMT in Hawaii or cops in Chicago to their approval of war profiteers to their Board of Trustees these instances too often happen behind closed doors beyond the watchful gaze of students whose lives are threatened by these systems of militarism. But we — students and folks impacted by U.S. militarization — are watching and recognize the power we have in faltering the systems of violence our universities strive to maintain.

It’s now time for universities to recognize us and our demands for them to divest from death. From Washington D.C. to California to Hawaii we are seeing other young people mobilizing on their campuses to call for their schools to sever ties with the military-industrial complex. We won’t stop until we turn the tide against war and militarism.

Fast-forward to the present and Ford wound up becoming one of Rivian’s biggest partners alongside Amazon. What most people may not realize however is that Ford nearly lost its spot to GM.

This Wall Street Journal report describes some of the clandestine dealings in cinematic detail and explores how Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe’s bond with Joe Hinrichs Ford’s former president of global operations became the foundation of Ford’s investment in the company.

According to the WSJ Hinrichs first met with Scaringe in 2018. But because Ford had just missed its earnings targets it wasn’t ready to invest in Rivian. This left room for GM which had already started working on its electric vehicles to slide in. However The WSJ says that leaders at Rivian remained skeptical of a deal with GM.

In 2019 Hinrichs met with Scaringe just after Amazon invested $700 million in Rivian. Hinrichs tried convincing him to reconsider a deal with Ford after Scaringe said his company was on the verge of a deal with GM.

Sensing hesitancy about GM Mr. Hinrichs said he urged the young executive to reconsider. ‘Just because you got engaged to someone doesn’t mean you need to marry them’ Mr. Hinrichs said he told Mr. Scaringe.

Hinrichs gave Scaringe yet another chance to talk — both of them happened to have meetings in Seattle and Hinrichs offered to give Scaringe a ride back to Detroit in Ford’s Gulfstream jet. Scaringe still had yet to seal a deal with GM and during the flight Hinrich and Scaringe laid out a deal. When they landed Hinrichs helped Scaringe stay out of sight of nearby GM executives:

As the plane taxied toward a hangar used by both Ford and GM executives on board spotted another jet outside the hangar with two GM-made black Cadillac Escalades waiting nearby. Mr. Hinrichs said he sensed Mr. Scaringe didn’t want to be seen by GM executives so Mr Hinrichs requested that a Lincoln Navigator be pulled alongside the plane. When the door opened Mr. Scaringe dashed down the plane’s steps and into the Navigator keeping his head down as Mr. Hinrichs loaded their luggage.

Ford and Rivian’s talks continued overnight and the two companies reached a deal at 4AM according to the WSJ. In April 2019 Ford announced that it would invest $500 million in the startup — it has since invested a total of $1.2 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9nbS10cnVja3MtYW5kLXN1dnMtZ2V0LXBvd2VyZnVsLWJyZW1iby1icmFrZS11cGdyYWRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Trucks And SUVs Get Powerful Brembo Brake Upgrades,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9nbS10cnVja3MtYW5kLXN1dnMtZ2V0LXBvd2VyZnVsLWJyZW1iby1icmFrZS11cGdyYWRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8xMS9yZWZyZXNoZWQtMjAyMi1jaGV2eS1zaWx2ZXJhZG8tdG8tb2ZmZXItcmVndWxhci1jYWItc3RhbmRhcmQtYm94LXZhcmlhbnQtaW4tdGhlLXUtcy_SAX1odHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjEvMTEvcmVmcmVzaGVkLTIwMjItY2hldnktc2lsdmVyYWRvLXRvLW9mZmVyLXJlZ3VsYXItY2FiLXN0YW5kYXJkLWJveC12YXJpYW50LWluLXRoZS11LXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Refreshed 2022 Chevy Silverado To Offer Regular Cab Standard Box Variant In The U.S.,"U.S.-based Chevy Silverado fans eager to get the Bow Tie brand’s iconic pickup truck with a Regular Cab Standard Box body style will be happy to learn that General Motors will offer that very soon with the refreshed 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500.

According to GM Authority sources General Motors will once again offer a Regular Cab Standard Box configuration of the Chevy Silverado in the U.S. with the launch of the fully refreshed 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500. However the Regular Cab Standard Box will only be available on the base-model 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Work Truck trim level also known as the WT.

Notably General Motors already sells Chevy Silverado Regular Cab Standard Box model variants in a number of markets around the world including in South America and the Middle East. Notably the Middle East also gets offers the Regular Cab Standard Box configuration in the RST and Trail Boss trims.

For those fans that have longed for the return of the Regular Cab Standard Box Silverado in the U.S. this no doubt comes as great news. That said the fact the body style will only be available with the base-model WT trim level may dampen the excitement a bit for some.

As a reminder General Motors unveiled the fully refreshed 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 pickup truck in September debuting a variety of changes and updates over the stop-gap 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Limited and pre-refresh 2021 Chevy Silverado 1500.

The refreshed 2022 model year is headlined by the introduction of a completely new interior which is offered on LT trims and above (LT LT Trail Boss RST ZR2 LTZ High Country).

Highlights inside include a revised cockpit including a new a digital 12.3-inch configurable instrument cluster a large 13.4-inch color touchscreen a range of new tech features plus a new console-style shifter (for models with the front bucket seats as the column shifter will remain available on trucks with the front bench seat). Additionally the range-topping High Country trim will offer the GM Super Cruise semi-autonomous driver assist system with towing capability.

The refreshed 2022 Chevy Silverado also includes revised exterior styling on all models more power and torque from the turbocharged 2.7L I4 L3B gasoline engine and greater towing capacity for the 3.0L I6 LM2 turbodiesel Duramax engine. Finally the refreshed Silverado also introduces the new ZR2 off-road trim level.

Editor’s note: an earlier version of this article referred to the body configuration in question as the Regular Cab Short Bed/Box which is technically not correct. First we should note that that the Silverado offers three box sizes:

Short: 70 inches long

Standard: 80 inches long

Long: 98 inches long

With that in mind the configuration that GM will add for the refreshed 2022 Silverado in the U.S. market is the Regular Cab with the Standard Bed (80 inches). This is where things get dicey: since the Standard Bed is the shortest available box for the Silverado Regular Cab it’s also sometimes referred to as the Short Bed. In any event the Regular Cab and the 80-inch-long Standard Bed is what’s being added for the 2022 model year. Meanwhile the Regular Cab Short Bed (70-inch-long box) configuration is not available in any market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcnZldHRlYmxvZ2dlci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNi9nbS1zaG93cy1vZmZpY2lhbC1xdWFydGVyLW1pbGUtdGltZS1vZi0xMC02LXNlY29uZHMtZm9yLXRoZS0yMDIzLWNvcnZldHRlLXowNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Shows Official Quarter Mile Time of 10.6 Seconds for the 2023 Corvette Z06 - Corvette: Sales News & Lifestyle,"Photo Credit: Chevrolet



Check out the picture of this promotion board standing next to the 2023 Corvette Z06 that was posted earlier today to the Corvette Forum by a member named Z0Sick6.

It shows the Z06 has 670 horsepower it goes 0-60 in 2.6 seconds and its official quarter-mile time is 10.6 seconds!

There was no trap speed listed for the Z06 so we’ll have to wait on that but this is an impressive improvement over the C7 Z06s official time of 10.95 at 127 mph. Not only that but it equals the 2019 Corvette ZR1’s time of 10.6 seconds at a trap speed of 134 MPH.



We also think that Chevy may be a little conservative here again as they have been in the past. Once owners start tracking and drag racing the car we will see improvements over the official stock times and we could even see some “hero runs” of 10.3 seconds or even better.

We’ll say this the 2023 Corvette Z06 just keeps on getting better and better the more we learn about it.

Can’t wait for the right-hand-drive Vauxhall version.

Advertisement - Page continues below

Ah sadly not. There won’t be one. There’s no RHD because this car began its dislocated life in America as the Pontiac Solstice roadster. Which was redesigned as a one-off Vauxhall concept the Lightning a shape that got manufactured as the Saturn Sky and is now rebadged an Opel for mainland Europe. Pontiac to Vauxhall to Saturn to Opel: General Motors will tell you this car is an exemplar of leveraging its global resources utilising synergies between divisions commonising architectures protecting brand-specific character. Watch out or you may well be sucked into the yadda yadda yadda of the management-speak vortex.

But good on GM for throwing off its stultifying corporate conservatism and launching a pure-bred sports-car platform. And at least the Opel GT’s gene pool has given it great looks. The Lightning was drawn in 2003 when GM’s British division Vauxhall was looking for a way to celebrate its centenary and GM’s advanced studio in Britain led by Simon Cox proposed this car based on the solstice platform. Well a sports car was always going to be preferable to the usual office party vibe of a birthday cake scorched by 100 candles and flat champagne-substitute in cheap plastic glasses. Back then in ’03 the Pontiac Solstice was still morphing secretly from a 2002 concept car to a 2005 production one. Still European sales numbers wouldn’t have justified production of a separate Opel/Vauxhall version like Cox was proposing. But then GM decided that Saturn in America would start sharing a design language – and in many cases entire cars – with Opel/Vauxhalls. And furthermore that Saturn deserved a version of the Pontiac Solstice.

Advertisement - Page continues below

So Cox’s design was dusted off and given a Saturn nose which happens to be an Opel nose. But in a final irony it will never be sold as a Vauxhall because a Vauxhall in left-handed form would sell in miniscule numbers so they won’t even be bothering with bringing it in officially as LHD. The GT looks quite the classic roadster but made modern with a strong stance and clean-cut edges distinctively crisp where the Pontiac is plump. The outside panels roll over into a sharp well-tailored dash design. The interior materials and finish are pretty good – probably better than an MX-5 which shows how far GM has come since the days when all its American interiors were made of throwaway plastics held together with spittle and hope. Up front is a four-cylinder 2.0-litre turbo engine kicking out a very spicy 260bhp and 260lb ft thanks to a twin-scroll turbo direct petrol injection and twin variable cam-phasing. It has two balancer shafts too. It’s hooked up to a five-speed manual – no need for six when the torque is spread this widely. A limited-slip diff takes care of traction and suspension is by double wishbones. It’s a pedigree spec and in Germany it costs only a few hundred euros more than a hot-hatch Astra. Most of the body’s strength comes from separate steel side structures plus cross-members – a bit like a Corvette understructure. You can feel the rigidity when you drive it: the body hardly quivers even over the lowest-budget American roads.

Improving cross-border payments with multi-CBDCs

Cross-border payments today can be slow and expensive. Unlike domestic payments where banks can pay each other directly on a single national payments platform there is no single international platform today for cross-border payments and settlements.

Instead the correspondent banking model is used where banks hold foreign currency accounts with each other. A single cross-border payment could pass through multiple correspondent banks using the foreign currencies held with them. Each leg of the overall transaction takes time and effort to process with fees levied that add up quickly and are passed on to customers resulting in slow and costly cross-border payments.

A multi-currency common settlement platform would enable transacting parties to pay each other in different currencies directly without the need for intermediaries such as correspondent banks.

A multi-CBDC shared platform will enable international settlements on a common platform streamlining the flow of cross-border payments and making payments faster cheaper and safer.

Designing and developing a multi-CBDC platform

Project Dunbar brings together the collective knowledge of central banks commercial banks and technology partners from earlier research and development work on digital currencies to design and develop a multi-CBDC platform. The primary work took place over nine weeks with three concurrent workstreams.

Challenges in implementing a multi-CBDC platform

A multi-CBDC platform for international settlements could significantly improve cross-border payments but there are challenges and questions regarding implementation that need to be addressed.

These critical challenges may have impeded the development of shared international settlement infrastructures previously but can now be resolved with modern technologies.

Addressing critical challenges

Distributed ledger technologies' decentralisation capabilities and the programmable nature of smart contracts and CBDCs tied together in a sophisticated platform design have produced an elegant solution for central banks to share a common settlement infrastructure for cross-border payments

Successful development of prototypes

Project Dunbar worked with R3 and Partior to successfully develop prototypes on the distributed ledger technologies of Corda and Quorum respectively. The prototypes proved the technical feasibility of implementing a shared multi-CBDC platform. While there are still further questions to be explored and challenges to be resolved the successful development is a first step towards the vision of a shared platform for international settlements using multi-CBDCs.

The details and conclusions of the project were published in a report that supports the efforts of the G20 roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments particularly in exploring an international dimension of CBDC design.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWF0dXJlcy8yMDIxLTExLTA4L2hvdy10b2dvLW1hZGUtYWxsLWRpZ2l0YWwtZ292ZXJubWVudC1zdGltdWx1cy1zeXN0ZW0taW4tdHdvLXdlZWtz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Togo Made All-Digital Government Stimulus System in Two Weeks,"Atani Bamaze was working his small plot of land scything weeds down to the rust-colored soil when he received a lifeline in the form of a text message.

A United Nations study shows that by achieving the SDGs the world could create at least US$ 12 trillion of market opportunities and 380 million new jobs with climate change efforts saving at least US$ 26 trillion by 2030. Big finance has renewed calls for a financial green revolution backed by global multilateral acting as insurers or first-loss absorbers to encourage the transition to sustainability for developing economies rather than awaiting new loans or debt write-offs.

A critical piece towards achieving the financing of the SDGs is the payment systems on which transaction settlement will be based. For example remittances by diaspora contributed 9% of GDP in 2015 and in many countries diaspora remittances equal or exceed Official Development Assistance (ODA) providing greater consistency compared to portfolio debt and equity flows. As part of the SDGs the United Nations has a target to reduce the costs associated with remittances through formal channels from an average of 6.5% in 2020 (lowest in history) to 3% by 2030.

There is thus a great need for faster cheaper and safer means for these remittances to reach the micro-beneficiaries to spur increased velocity of money enhanced activity and economic redistribution. Access to finance remains a pre-requisite for sustainable development. Financial inclusion efforts globally could address the financing gaps for the world’s poorest including women who own a growing number of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) yet possess relatively lower share of global wealth. Globally payments systems are often strictly supervised due to the systemic risks posed and thus have significantly higher entry barriers and global cooperation is needed to converge goals and make tangible progress.

In this piece we will explore possibilities for a blended approach in the financing of the payment’s architecture supporting the SDGs. The financing architecture for the SDGs are the “blood vessels” through which infrastructure projects are made sustainable e.g. the collection of taxes and payment for public goods are enhanced through digital collection tools. The SDG financing is also the mechanism through which aid cash transfers and remittances would facilitate increased benefits to the micro-population. This is the role played by Fintech companies which continue to pursue the digitization of money with the associated impact model of TechFin companies pursuing a strategy of monetizing data.

The investments needed in the payments industry to catalyze SDG benefits to citizens will definitely take the form of Impact Investments. To accomplish the objective of financial inclusion lower costs and enhance affordability of remittances Central banks would need adopt a hybrid digital currency model providing back-ups for intermediaries to prevent crowding-out of financial intermediaries. Interoperability must also be incorporated in initial design frameworks. Private capital deployed on these projects will provide expansion funds while still generating a reasonable return to shareholders. A combination of seignorage and philanthropy prevents cost transfer to public users with concessional funding acting as first loss pieces buoyed by limited government funding. Political risk insurance will be provided by multilaterals.

The race towards greener digital cleantech assets an end to poverty eradication of hunger good health for all clean energy clean water zero hunger and other SDG targets will not take a dash but rather could be described as a long marathon with SDG 17 “Partnership for the Goals” playing a most critical role with stakeholders acting as collaborators rather than competitors. The pandemic induced digitalization has enhanced the issuance of centralized central bank digital currency to advance cross border payments and enhance financial inclusion. These retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) have the potential to provide greater benefits to the payments system and for consumers and a hybrid model (facilitated by financial intermediaries) is advised rather than a direct model which would prevent disintermediation. Also limited anonymity with initial identification and its subsequent expiry would minimize privacy risks encourage private sector participation and build trust in the financial system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vbmlnZXJpYS11cmdlZC10by1pbnZlc3QtaW4tY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS1hZ2FpbnN0LXNwYXRlLW9mLWF0dGFja3Mv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9wdW5jaG5nLmNvbS9uaWdlcmlhLXVyZ2VkLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LWFnYWluc3Qtc3BhdGUtb2YtYXR0YWNrcy8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nigeria urged to invest in cybersecurity against spate of attacks,"The value of the Internet cannot be overemphasised. In fact its emergence made life easy and offered ample opportunities for many with just a push of buttons on laptops and phones. Many people with internet-enabled phones have wide-ranging things they do with them. Globally people connect and engage in business. But technological advancement brings about diverse challenges including cyber attacks.

Cyber attack has been roundly defined as an attempt by hackers or cybercriminals to disable or damage a computer network or system. It can be done through phishing ransomware malware man-in-the-middle or other ways.

An increase in cyber attacks has been reported globally. According to NEXUSGUARD a cybersecurity company in the first half of 2021 a distributed denial-of-service – a malicious and targeted attempt to disrupt traffic to a particular server service or network increased 233 per cent. It further reported that hackers used new attack patterns that can cripple communications service providers and internet service providers without being detected by signature-based methods.

Cybersecurity as IBM defined it “is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks.” However cyber attackers keep exploring new ways to sidestep defence measures and anti-cyberattack mechanisms.

Besides cyber security experts have noted that constant cyberattacks would lead to a state of chaos cause significant damage in the way businesses were done and erode the country’s reputation in the global space.

A Russian multinational cybersecurity and anti-virus provider Kaspersky reported that between January and June this year of the 206000 mobile malware detected and blocked by the company for the Middle East Turkey and Africa over 14071 of them originated from Nigeria.

The rate at which cybercriminals adopt quick methods and technologies to perpetrate cyberattack is alarming.

According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies “close to $600bn is lost to cybercrime each year.”

According to a 2020 report by the Global Cybersecurity Index on the snapshot of cybersecurity measures taken by countries Nigeria ranked 47th out of 182 countries globally and fourth in Africa after Mauritius Tanzania and Ghana in that order.

This significant increase in cyberattack is worrying and the Enterprise Sales Manager for Kaspersky Africa Bethwel Opil stated that “Mobile malware remains a significant threat for corporate and personal users across Africa.”

African cybersecurity study by Demadiur Systems Limited noted that N270.22m was spent by banks insurance companies and government institutions in Nigeria to prevent cyberattacks in 2018.

It noted in the report entitled ‘Cybersecurity skills gap’ that parts of the funds were expended for the purchase of hardware and software such as Antivirus load balancer network access controls among others.

In 2013 Nigerians lost about N159bn to cyber security threats according to global payment giant Paypal.com. Since 2014 the country is losing N90bn to cybercrime and in December 2015 it ranked 17th most attacked nation globally based on threat intelligence collated from Check Point Software Technologies

Using the pandemic as a bait to impersonate brands and mislead employees and customers cybercriminals have been able to gain access to technological devices of unsuspecting individuals and corporate organisations. The Institute for Security Studies also affirmed that Nigeria witnessed an increase in Cyberattacks at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns.

However though the COVID-19 curve appeared flattened cybercriminals continue to wreak havoc. Recently the Nigerian Communications Commission alerted Nigerians to a malware Flubot targeted at stealing banking details from Android users by requesting “fake security updates and app installations.”

It was reported that in 2018 commercial banks in the country lost about N15bn to electronic fraud and cybercrime while over 17600 bank customers lost N1.9bn to cyber fraud in the same year.

Meanwhile the Nigeria Consumer Awareness and Financial Enlightenment Initiative projected a $6trn loss to cybercrime within and outside Nigeria by 2030.

Commenting on how to curb cyberattacks in the country a software engineer and tech content creator Adora Nwodo said cyberattacks affected individuals and organisations using the internet stating that it could lead to personal security and financial threat.

Nwodo said “Many times when I hear people talk about cybersecurity in Nigeria they are usually talking about the banking sector. Cyberattacks can affect other organisations that do anything on the internet; from banks hospitals to government agencies. This can lead to personal security threats (people’s private information getting leaked) and threats in finance. Cyberattacks can also paralyse systems and make data inaccessible. This is bad for everybody.”

She called for cybersecurity training for every individual and corporate organisation to enable them recognise security threats in their different forms and learn how to tackle attendant issues.

Nwodo added “We also need to educate other Nigerian citizens through TV radio or social media communications about not sharing passwords using secured Wi-Fi controlling who has access to their computers and more.”

She emphasised that cybersecurity should be taken seriously adding “because it helps us protect all our data from theft and corruption. Our personal data medical data financial data (and more) getting into the wrong hands could be terrible for us as people. People have lost millions from scams people have put unsolicited information online that has made them get security threats and more. Cyber attacks also aid identity theft and internet fraud and as people we don’t want to fall victims to the scams.”

On his part the Acting Director Cybersecurity Department National Information Technology Development Agency Dr Ahmed Lawan stated that victims of successful cyberattacks would suffer substantial financial reputational and legal losses.

Lawan said “The reputational damage that cyberattacks can inflict on a country is enormous. Trust is an essential component of any customer relationship as it is in any business. Cyberattacks can devastate a company’s reputation and erode customers’ trust in a country or in businesses operating in one’s country.

“This in turn may result in a loss of customers a decrease in sales and a decrease in profits all of which will eventually result in a decrease in revenue generated by the Federal Government. Furthermore the reputational damage can have a significant impact on one’s suppliers as well as relationships with local and foreign investors. Lastly organisations or businesses that are victims of a cyberattack will incur costs associated with repairing affected systems networks and devices.”

Commenting on ways to achieve cybersecurity Lawan stated that security was a continuous effort and “having a solid incident response plan can help in case of attacks.”

He further called for an increase in raising awareness of cyberhygiene for every individual regardless of their status stating that this would help reduce the occurrences of cyberattacks.

Also a technology policy analyst data protection and cybersecurity lawyer Moses Faya said that the lack of trust reputational damage and financial loss were the effects of cyberattacks in Nigeria.

Faya said “Trust is the bedrock of everything so when there is a lack of trust customers become wary of continual usage of the platform. This then leads to reputational damage which costs organisations more money to reassure customers of their brand as well as repair the damage caused by the attacks.”

He noted that every individual should be aware of the activities of cybercriminals and ways to mitigate the attacks.

He stated “The cardinal aspect regardless of whatever is available and effective measures are awareness. No matter how secure one’s system is humans are still the ones who give access to the attacks to happen. There should be an increase in awareness for individuals. Institutions are also encouraged to alert relevant authorities whenever they experience cyber attacks.

“People need to be aware that they should not click on links sent to their email or social media accounts from addresses or accounts they do not trust. The best way is to copy the link and paste them into the address bar of one’s browser to check if it is genuine. One’s email password(s) should contain small and capital letters and other characters. Do not use your birthday or that of your loved ones in your passwords rather use something that is not known to the public. Do not access your social media accounts or bank application over public Wi-Fi.”

Faya also urged governments to put in place technical infrastructure and institutions that would enable quick response to cyberattacks adding that cybercriminals could rob individuals and organisations of their hard-earned money and private documents upon infiltration of gadgets.

He added that if Nigeria was able to improve its cybersecurity it would redeem its image in the global space.

He added “Data and one’s digital footprint is the new digital currency and people are hovering around the internet to find out how to get this information. But if we can put certain measures to protect such information from being used by the bad guys then it would redeem Nigeria’s image and reduce organisational cost.”"

Or something to that extent.

The first college football game hosted at Globe Life Field was a thriller as Army snapped a three-game losing streak in a 21-14 win over Air Force in the Commanders’ Classic Saturday afternoon.

Army quarterback Christian Anderson made his first big mistake of the game in overtime fumbling the ball a mere yard from the promised land. His left tackle Jordyn Law found the ball for the game-deciding touchdown.

“My heart dropped” Anderson said in a postgame news conference. “I felt the ball pop out and I was kind of lucky that [Law] was there. I didn’t know who came up with it first.”

Law was shocked by the elusive lineman touchdown in front of 32537 in attendance.

“It’s very surreal” Law said. “Never in my life would I have thought I’d pick up a fumble and score a game-winning touchdown. I was just fortunate I was in the right spot to make the play.”

This game wasn’t always spectacular. Army and Air Force’s 56th meeting and fourth at a neutral site wasn’t short of pregame highlights. Former Air Force defensive tackle and ex-Cowboys three-time Super Bowl champion Chad Hennings was featured on the big screen six Medal of Honor recipients were recognized and helicopters soared over the open dome.

That was followed by a big-play hiatus.

The first half was entirely sluggish. Army’s best play led to a missed field goal and Air Force never made it to the red zone.

Army won its first four games of the season but entered Saturday needing a spark. The initial defensive slugfest was the inverse of Army’s 70-56 barn-burner loss last week to CFP No. 9 Wake Forest.

Both offenses emerged in the second half.

Tyhier Tyler the companion to Anderson in Army’s interchanging quarterback attack was that spark. He broke the scoring silence with a 9-yard touchdown run on the opening drive of the third quarter. Anderson followed with a touchdown of his own a 62-yard pass to Tyrell Robinson.

Air Force quarterback Haaziq Daniels threw for over 200 yards with a touchdown but said he wished his last pass of the game was more on target.

The Commanders’ Classic which Hennings called a “sibling rivalry” in an interview with The Dallas Morning News in October isn’t a stranger to low-scoring affairs. Neither team ever scored more than 14 points in the previous three neutral site matchups and this was the third straight scoreless first quarter in the series.

The new site and fancy venue demanded a proper game.

“The game was a tremendous contest” Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said “but with everything else that was a part of it you just felt like this is the essence of who we are as a school and what we want to be a part of.”

While this won’t be the last college football game hosted at Globe Life Field it lived up as an exciting opener.

Trailing 21-14 Air Force was facing fourth down at the Army 6 yard line on its first-overtime possession. Army cornerback Jabari Moore said he liked the play call that was sent in from defensive coordinator Nate Woody. He was assigned single-man coverage on Dane Kinamon who lined up on the right side of the formation. The receiver took a short route into the end zone and veered to his right as quarterback Haaziq Daniels was flushed from the pocket by Andre Carter. Moore was practically draped on Kinamon all throughout the cut and when the pass was delivered on target Moore extended his left hand and knocked the ball away.

It was the biggest play of Moore’s career he said.

“I was blessed enough to be right there and make that play’’ Moore said.

A huge Army lineup rushed the field at Globe Life Stadium in Arlington Texas similar to when the Los Angeles Dodgers charged the same end of the neutral field with the final out of the 2020 COVID World Series over the Tampa Bay Rays. It was the first football game ever played at the stadium and an exciting precursor to the Army-Air Force matchup Nov. 5 2022 on the same field.

The unlikely Army hero was sophomore lineman Jordyn “Boobie’’ Law. Quarterback Christian Anderson was attempting to score from 6 yards out on the first overtime possession but had the ball popped free. Law recovered the ball as it bounded for the goal line and posted his first collegiate touchdown.

“It's very surreal’’ Law said. “Never in my life I would have thought I’d pick up a fumble and score the game-winning touchdown especially in a game (as big) as Army versus Air Force. “I'm just happy I was able to be in the right spot at the right time to help my team win.’’

The Army-Air Force game has been the most closely contested FBS series in the nation since 2014 with an average combined score of 27.7 so it’s no wonder the two service academy programs headed into overtime tied at 14 with the most coveted prize at stake.

Army could not hold the 14-3 lead it took into the fourth quarter. Kinamon caught a 4-yard pass for a score not even five minutes into the period. Fearing the limitation of future possessions Air Force coach Troy Calhoun called for a two-point conversion to make it a one-score game. DeAndre Hughes took a pitch to the right side and his dive caught the pylon to pull the Falcons within 14-11.

Air Force got the ball back with 5:03 remaining and 91 yards from goal. Daniels completed four consecutive throws to get to midfield. He also sprinted for a 13-yard gain on a fourth-and-10 call. An illegal block below the waist call pushed Air Force back 15 yards to the Army 26 and the Falcons had to settle for a game-tying 30-yard field goal by Matthew Dapore with 23 seconds remaining.

Air Force won the coin toss for overtime and deferred to Army. Wide receiver Isaiah Alston reached out for a 12-yard grab on a third-and-8 call down to the Falcon 11. Three snaps later Anderson went on a keeper from the 6 but Thadius Blackmon stripped him of the ball at the 4. The ball bounded forward toward the goal line and Law fell on it for the recovery and score.

The game was scoreless at halftime. “A slugfest’’ is how Army coach Jeff Monken described it. Quarterback Tyhier Tyler who got the start and alternated with Anderson directed a seven-play scoring drive out of the break. He found Tyrell Robinson on a 39-yard pass play to the Falcon 15. Four plays later Tyler stepped through a tackle at the line of scrimmage surged forward and dove across the line for a 9-yard score.

After Air Force stalled and settled for a 39-yard field goal Anderson found motion man Robinson on a 15-yard toss to the right at the 34 and Robinson sprinted the rest of the way for a 79-yard score and 14-3 lead.

The Army season could have spiraled out of control with a fourth consecutive loss something not seen since dropping five in a row in 2019. Instead the Black Knights (5-3) retain the CIC Trophy for the fourth year out of five and inch closer to the standard six wins required by pre-2000 NCAA rules for bowl participation.

“After our last loss we declared as a team that it’s a new season’’ Tyler said. “We’re looking to go undefeated in this new season so we put everything behind us: the wins the losses the ups and downs.’’

The Black Knights have an agreement to play in an ESPN-owned and operated bowl in 2021 2023 and 2025 or can accept a bid twice before 2025 to play in the Belk Bowl in Charlotte North Carolina.

Army can “win” the CIC Trophy outright with a win over Navy on Dec. 11 at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford New Jersey. A setback would forge a three-way tie at 1-1 and the previous winner keeps the trophy for another year.

“It’s been six weeks since our last win … that feels like forever’’ Monken said. “So it’s great to win and it’s particularly great to win a big rivalry game one that you’re playing for an incredibly coveted trophy and chance to go to the White House if we win the next one. That’s a big deal.’’

Army won the game of mirror-image option offenses despite a season low of 108 rushing yards and losing the time of possession 30:57 to 29:03. Anderson passed for 175 yards Tyler the one completion for 39. Tyler led with 39 rushing yards and Anthony Adkins added 21. Alston’s four grabs went for 79 yards and Robinson’s pair went for 118. Cam Jones hauled in an Andre Carter-tipped breakup for a back-breaking interception late in the third quarter.

Air Force (6-3) lost despite 401 total yards of offense with 175 on the ground and 13 completions for 226 yards.

After Law's game-saving recovery the Black Knights (5-3) denied the Falcons (6-3) the end zone when Jabari Moore broke up Haaziq Daniels' fourth-down pass.

''I got lucky'' Anderson said. ''We never stopped battling at the end. We just executed when we needed to. It feels really good. It's definitely nerve-wracking having it come down to the last drive.''

The victory means Army can do no worse than a tie for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy which goes to the service academy with the best record in round-robin competition. Army will retain the prize whether it wins or loses against Navy in December as Air Force defeated the Midshipmen earlier this season. Army came in having won three of the past four trophies.

''That trophy that we're fighting for every team is desperate to win it to get it in their trophy case'' Army coach Jeff Monken said. ''I am really proud of these guys.''

Air Force tied the game on Matthew Depore's second field goal of the game a 30-yarder with 23 seconds left in regulation. They had reached the Army 11 before a 15-yard chop-block penalty stalled the drive.

After a scoreless first half Army took the second-half kickoff and with the help of a 39-yard pass from Tyhier Tyler to Tyrell Robinson scored on Tyler's 9-yard run. Air Force responded with Dapore's 39-yard field goal and Army came right back with a 79-yard pass play from Christian Anderson to Robinson and a 13-3 lead after three quarters.

Air Force closed the gap to 14-9 early in the fourth on Daniels' 4-yard toss to Dane Kinamon with the key play on the drive a 31-yard completion to David Cormier.

Air Force and Army came in as the nation's top two rushing teams but turned to the pass in the second half. Air Force outgained Army 401-322 in total yards including 226-214 in the air. Robinson had 118 yards receiving for Army while Brandon Lewis had 106 for the Falcons.

''When we throw the ball and have to throw the ball it's usually not a great formula for us to win because we are a running football team'' Monken said. ''We try to control the clock and keep away from the other team. They were the same way. They went to the air and had a lot of success.''

Army snapped a three-game losing streak in the game that was played at the Texas Rangers' Globe Life Stadium the first time these teams have met at a neutral site since 1965.

After graduating West Point in 2006 Brown was commissioned as an infantry officer and says it was an honor and responsibility to lead troops deployed in 2008 to Kandahar Afghanistan: “One of the things that as I look back on that time– my position on our foreign policy and the way that we interact and use our military overseas has really shifted and changed a lot. You know I’ve been on other media outlets speaking about how I don’t believe that we should continue this sort of policing the world policy and using our military for nation building but at the time I was taught that that was a way that we ought to be using our military and counterinsurgency. Nation building was an appropriate use of that. And so that’s what I led my troops to do. And in fact in September 2008 that’s when we were on a mission specifically to deliver turbines to a dam on the Helmand River. This was supposed to be a great humanitarian project. We were providing security for it. It was a multinational mission. And so we assisted in making sure the turbines got delivered to the dam. And then on the extraction of the forces that were delivering them is when mine and another platoon for my company was ambushed. I was the closest friendly forces maneuvering to support them and that’s where our vehicle hit an IED and blew up killed one of my soldiers and left four of us wounded. Ultimately I had to be Medivac’ed to San Antonio to the Army Medical Center and started a three year journey in recovery. Which was as you can imagine a very pivotal moment in my life. Changed a lot of things… but started a whole new life.”

Captain Brown’s new life was shaped by over thirty surgeries years of rehabilitation and the most taxing part of it all according to Brown was being disfigured. “So much of our identity is tied up in our face and what we look like and that was that was very difficult. Going through this transformation was very emotionally taxing. But I got through it. And I attribute two things to that one just this was sort of a faith journey for me in in believing that something good can come out of trials in our life. And and I had my mother spent six months with me helping me recover and then she sort of handed the baton off to someone who was a lieutenant Amy Larsen at the time and she was a dietitian in the burn unit and ultimately became my wife and Amy has been by my since then. We were married in May 2009 so just about nine months after I was wounded” Brown said.

Brown says that he came out of his trauma and rehabilitation as a leader and a servant “without anyone to lead and no one to serve for while” and for a period of time was really lost as many in the military community are as they transition into civilian life. Transitioning for Brown was a very humbling experience due to the limitations from his injuries and recovery: “At 24 before I got blown up you think you know everything in the world. You think you’re bulletproof you’re invincible and so to to be reduced down physically the way I was to be laying in a bed not able to feed myself or even bathe myself was a very humbling experience and and so I think one of the best lessons I took out of this was just the mindset and the sort of the life philosophy that the life I live is not my own. [This philosophy] it’s just it’s just something that was impressed in my heart as I was recovering was I should not have survived what I went through in Afghanistan. And the fact that I’m alive means I have some other purpose in life and that is to serve others and I just needed to find how to do that.”

Brown believes that his advantage to beating both Adam Laxalt in the primary and Cortez Masto in the general is that he is chosen by the people rather than by Washington DC insiders.

As to why he chose a large race for his first political candidacy is because he wants to make a real difference and sees the Senate as a place where there is a need for change on behalf of the state of Nevada and the country. Brown stated “I think people are seeing that there can be candidates that aren’t necessarily grown up through the system who can still represent the needs of the people and who can be strong leaders who can be effective at fundraising and people have just attached themselves to this campaign. And when I say people have attached themselves this campaign I mean this is a grassroots campaign. At its core. We’ve had over 12000 donors in q3 and raised over a million dollars.”

In contrasting his policies to those of former Nevada AG Laxalt who spent five years in the Navy and was posted at naval air bases in Italy and Iraq Brown admits that in “broad strokes there is not a whole lot of difference.” He maintains that where they are different is based in who is going to work hard to meet the people of Nevada and who is gonna work just as hard to represent them. “I don’t come with the sort of the attachments of special interest money that Adam has.” Brown said. “My accountability is to the people that the people who fund this campaign an average of $75 at a time. So I’m answering to the people. Adam was recruited endorsed and funded by DC and I’m being supported by Nevadans.”"
GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vNi1yaXNpbmctc3RhcnMtZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1wcm9tb3RlZC1tYW5hZ2luZy1kaXJlY3Rvci1qdXN0aW4tdHVjay0yMDIxLTEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Rising Stars Recently Promoted to Managing Director at Goldman Sachs,"Now that the dust has settled and Goldman Sachs announced its largest managing director class in history this week — 643 new members in all — there's one question on every industry watcher's mind: Who made the cut?

Among the new designates is a group of thirty-somethings with killer resumes who are poised to lead the prestigious Wall Street bank into its next generation. They've conquered the big leagues in the NFL to the big leagues of global finance — and now we're revealing a few of their impressive backgrounds to you.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Those who managed to reach this point are rising stars in their respective fields with stellar credentials both in the office and away from work. One is former chief of staff to ex-Goldman President Gary Cohn a veteran of the Trump administration while another is a 30-year-old black belt. They've spoken openly about their views on leadership from confronting feelings of ""imposter syndrome"" at work to recognizing the responsibility of mentoring the next generation.

Victorious new MD promotes made their feelings of elation known this week after learning they'd landed the platinum title.

Take Jumi Barnes for instance. The global head of investment-banking digital platform engineering was among the newly-anointed MDs and took to LinkedIn to share that she was ""extremely grateful to God"" for having notched the achievement.

""Such an honor to be named Managing Director at Goldman Sachs... I'm grateful for the village that raised me and for all the support and opportunities along the way"" she wrote in a post that's been liked more than 15000 times.

At Goldman Sachs the managing director title is just one step below the firm's all-powerful partnership. The road up the mountain to MD is fraught with politics and power-brokering as Insider recently reported.

Here are a few young leaders who just scaled the summit.

Jemma Wolfe & Stephan Lambert

Jemma Wolfe 32 and Stephan Lambert 30 were appointed global co-heads of strategy for Goldman's consumer and wealth management arm earlier this year.

And that's a big deal because it puts them in charge of finding ways to grow Goldman's increasingly important consumer and wealth businesses such as through acquisitions.

One major purchase that Goldman announced earlier this year is GreenSky a home-improvement installment lender for which the bank will pay $2.2 billion entirely in stock. Upon the deal's closing Greensky is set to become part of consumer-banking service Marcus which itself is part of the CWM division.

""In their new roles Jemma and Stephan will work closely with many of you and Firmwide Strategy to evaluate growth opportunities whether through organic builds partnerships acquisitions or strategic investments"" Tucker York and Stephanie Cohen co-heads of consumer and wealth management wrote in an internal memo announcing the appointments in January which was viewed by Insider.

Wolfe joined Goldman Sachs in the firm's markets coverage group which sits within its investment-management division in 2012. As she rose through the ranks she eventually became a vice president on the firmwide strategy team in 2019 which at the time was led by Cohen.

In that role Wolfe spearheaded Launch With GS a brainchild of Cohen's which provides capital support to diverse entrepreneurs. Two former Goldman Sachs employees who declined to be identified but who knew Wolfe said the rising star and Cohen appeared to share a mentor-mentee relationship.

Lambert was previously an investment banker focusing on deals within the financial-services sector. He joined Goldman first as an intern in 2013 and then as a full-time analyst the following year according to his LinkedIn page. Forbes named him to the finance section of its annual ""30 Under 30"" list earlier this year.

He's worked on numerous acquisitions by Goldman over the past several years and participated in the debut of Marcus which has since grown through developments such as the rollout of the Apple Card.

Lambert was also an instructor and second-degree black belt at Yong-In Martial Arts located in Lake Bluff Illinois before he enrolled at Duke University in 2009 his LinkedIn page indicated.

In time for Black History Month last year Sean Legister a newly-promoted MD in the firm's alternatives capital markets and strategy group spoke to Jake Siewert Goldman's former global head of communications on the ""Exchanges at Goldman Sachs"" podcast.

In the course of the February 2020 interview Legister and Siewert shared an open dialogue about Legister's family history and how he's faced feelings of ""imposter syndrome"" at times throughout his career.

""When I got here from Amherst College I suffered from massive imposter syndrome"" said Legister now 32. ""I was this athlete from Amherst College who's Black who looked around and didn't necessarily see a ton of people like me and the ones who were went to Ivy League schools and studied finance or math or economics.""

""There was just this element of a fish out of water"" he added.

Legister started at Goldman Sachs in 2010 as a summer analyst in the securities division according to his LinkedIn page.

As an undergrad focusing on English and Black studies at Amherst Legister played football and ran track. A career in finance he said on the podcast was unexpected.

Legister also spoke about his family history with his parents having immigrated from Jamaica. Going back to the island nation over the years has served as a gut-check about the realities of life away from the prosperous nature of the global finance industry he said.

""Having worked on Wall Street for the last eight-and-a-half years I've seen exorbitant amounts of wealth"" he said.

""But going home and again seeing my family members — it's 2020 and my grandmother doesn't have running water. So there are elements of understanding my family's humble beginnings that kind of keeps me grounded and keeps me pretty humble.""

Justin Tuck

After sustaining an injury in 2015 Justin Tuck traded in his New York Giants jersey for a suit and tie.

Tuck a former NFL footballer and two-time Super Bowl champ joined Goldman Sachs' private wealth division in 2018 after obtaining an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

The 38-year-old father of two who has also played for the Oakland Raiders was born in Kellyton Alabama. He started down the path to becoming a professional football player while a student at the University of Notre Dame and his formidable game later helped propel the New York Giants to two Super Bowl victories against the New England Patriots in 2008 and 2012.

In a 2019 article posted to the Goldman Sachs website Tuck pointed to similarities between athletics and his newfound career in finance.

""It's all about relationships"" he said. ""Dealing with personalities in locker rooms helps. The correlation between an NFL locker room and a desk or client meeting is much higher than I would have anticipated.""

The former Goldman Sachs employee whom Insider spoke to described Tuck as magnanimous to junior staffers.

""JT's known that if you are near him — if you are in the cafeteria line and Justin's there he's going to buy your meal"" this person said. ""People would be like 'Oh JT's going to breakfast. Go down and grab a smoothie.'""

Lalit Gurnani 31 has been with Goldman Sachs full-time since 2011 first as an analyst within its firmwide strategy division and later as chief of staff to ex-Goldman President Gary Cohn a veteran of the Trump administration.

In 2014 Gurnani headed west joining the investment bank's storied technology media and telecommunications (TMT) team in the firm's San Francisco office. Ever since he's advised on deals like public offerings for Redfin and Twilio plus multi-billion-dollar SPAC mergers for businesses like Aurora a self-driving startup as well as lodging company Sonder and data and analytics firm Planet Labs.

Earlier this year Insider named Gurnani to our annual list of Rising Stars on Wall Street. In an interview in September tied to his Rising Stars selection Gurnani spoke about mentoring the next generation of talent — a hot topic on Wall Street after banks like Goldman came under fire tied to juniors' complaints of draconian working conditions.

""Giving these analysts these associates these junior VPs almost a platform to go and be their best selves is really exciting to see in person"" he told Insider.

Gurnani defined mentorship as being able to champion junior bankers in presenting at client meetings pitching for new business or delving into deal sectors they're personally interested in.

""If I hadn't been forced to almost step up a little bit earlier in my career I don't think I'd be where I am today"" he added citing mentors as being key to his own career development.

""To me it's been important because it's what kept me at Goldman for over a decade and it's really exciting seeing people grow up in their careers and be able to accomplish bigger and better things.""

Shireen Sharma an investment banker in the firm's TMT group teamed up with Goldman Sachs President John Waldron and partners Kurt Simon and David Dubner this year to advise AT&T on the spin-out of its WarnerMedia business to Discovery for roughly $130 billion including debt as Insider reported in May.

That deal is expected to close mid-2022 pending shareholder approval.

Sharma also advised AT&T on the formation of DIRECTV a joint venture with private-equity firm TPG to manage AT&T's US video business. That partnership which was announced in February was set to value the newly-formed business at roughly $16 billion according to a Bloomberg News report.

Prior to joining Goldman Sachs in 2015 Sharma was an associate in TMT investment banking at Barclays based in New York.

Now it has raised $100 million to fuel its growth a round of funding that values H2O.ai at $1.7 billion post-money ($1.6 billion pre-money).

This is a Series E round and it’s being led by a strategic backer the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) which has been a customer of the startup and will be using the backing to kick off a deeper partnership between the two to build new services. Others in the round include Goldman Sachs Pivot Investment Partners Crane Venture Partners and Celesta Capital. Further plans for the funding include building more products for H2O.ai as a whole and hiring more talent to continue expanding the company’s H2O AI Hybrid Cloud platform.

This is not the first time that a customer has led a round as a strategic backer: in 2019 Goldman Sachs led the company’s Series D of $72.5 million. As a sign of how the company has been growing and the general appetite for what it does H2O’s valuation has leapfrogged since that last round when it was valued at $400 million per PitchBook data. Mountain View-based H2O.ai has raised $246.5 million to date.

The fact that both of the last rounds have been led by big banks that are also customers of H2O.ai’s speaks a lot to where the opportunity has been for the startup. Sri Ambati the founder and CEO (who previously was also a co-founder of Platfora which was acquired by Workday) told me over email that about 40% of the company’s revenues currently come from the very wide and all-encompassing world of financial services.

“Retail banking credit cards payments — almost every payment system from PayPal to MasterCard are customers of H2O” he said. On the equities side companies power fixed income asset management and mortgage backed security services using H2O’s technology with MarketAxess Franklin Templeton and BNY Mellon also “strong” customers he said.

That is also seeing a growing complement of business from other verticals he added: Unilever Reckitt P&G are among those in consumer goods; UPS is one of its users in logistics and delivery; Chipotle is among those in food services; and he said that AT&T “is one of our largest customers.”

Covid-19 has had a role to play here too.

“Manufacturing became a fast-growing vertical due to supply chain disruption and demand sensing” he said of the pandemic. “We launched H2O AI Health to help our hospitals and providers payers like Aetna and pharma customers.”

Notably H2O.ai is also now breaking ground into working more with other tech companies that want to build more AI into their own workflows to in turn provide services to their own customers. “Our latest wins are in vertical clouds and SaaS ISVs” Ambati said.

The company has offered an open source component to its services which it calls simply H2O from its earliest days and that is now used by over 20000 enterprises. Part of the reason for that is its flexibility: H2O.ai says that its open source framework works both on top of existing big data infrastructure on bare metal or on top of existing Hadoop Spark or Kubernetes clusters and is able to ingest data directly from HDFS Spark S3 Azure Data Lake or any other data source into it’s in-memory distributed key-value store.

“Our open source platform gives freedom and ability for customers to build their own AI centers of competence and excellence” Ambati said of the open source tools. “We are like the Tenzing Sherpas of the AI mountains helping our customers to traverse and conquer AI peaks.”

That framework can be used by engineers to build customized applications while H2O.ai’s proprietary tools provide more completed applications in areas like fraud detection churn prediction anomaly detection price optimization and credit scoring — areas that can benefit from the ingestion of massive amounts of data in order to gain better insights into what might happen next: these sit either as a complement to what human analysts and data scientists might be able to unearth or potentially in some cases as a replacement for the more basic work they might do. In all there are currently some 45 applications in all.

The plan Ambati said is to over time build out more of these which will reside in “app stores” in specific verticals offering a range of its proprietary pre-built tools particular to the demands of each of them.

The trend fueling H2O.ai’s growth has been gaining momentum for several years now.

Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for the world of enterprise IT: used well tools like machine learning natural language processing and computer vision can speed up productivity or even open up completely new areas of opportunity for an organization. Over time it can save companies billions of dollars in operational and other costs.

One big issue however is that in many cases organizations might lack the internal teams to build or carry through projects that use AI and that’s before considering the fact that as needs and parameters evolve all of that infrastructure will need updating too. Technology touches everything in an enterprise these days but not every enterprise is a tech company.

H2O.ai is not the first or only startup that has aimed to fill this gap in the market although it seems to have managed its task a little more successfully than others.

Notably Element.AI out of Canada was built out on the back of a large amount of funding and buy-in from big tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia also to address the idea of democratizing AI for the wider world of enterprises that might lack the resources to build and run AI tools themselves but could very much benefit from them before their businesses simply get cannibalized by the many AI-fuelled tech companies moving into their spaces. It had a strong focus on integration (it was a little like an Accenture for AI services) but never managed to make a big enough jump from concept to business and was eventually acquired in 2020 by ServiceNow to complement its own efforts to build tools for businesses.

Ambati said that only about 10% of H2O.ai’s business is in the area of services with the remainder 90% coming from its products as an explanation for why one startup’s approach worked while another did not.

“It is easy to get lured by services in data science and AI” he said. “Being true to our product maker culture and yet building deep customer empathy and listening is critical to success. Customers experience our maker culture and become makers themselves. We are continuously making our software easier (democratizing) low-code reusable recipes and automation through AI Cloud and building data pipelines AI AppStores and delivering AI as a service that our customers can use to improve their customer experiences brands and communities.

“The big difference — we are raising a forest not just a tree. H2O AI Cloud H2O Wave our low-code Application Development H2O AI AppStores Marketplace and H2O-3 Open Source ML are at the core of AI Applications and software already and we are partnering with customers and their ecosystem of partners and developers.”

That’s a play and business resonating well with investors too

“Commonwealth Bank has a significant asset in the millions of data points collected every day. AI already has helped us to improve our customer experience however we know there is untapped potential to do more” said Matt Comyn CEO of CBA in a statement. “The investment in and strategic partnership with H2O.ai extends our leadership in artificial intelligence and ultimately boosts the bank’s ability to offer leading digital propositions and reimagined products and services to customers.” Dr. Andrew McMullan chief data and analytics officer at CBA will join the H2O.ai board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hY2Nlc3N3aXJlLmNvbS82NzE1MTUvaW52ZXN0b3ItYWxlcnQta2Vzc2xlci10b3Bhei1tZWx0emVyLWNoZWNrLWxscC1yZW1pbmRzLWdhb3R1LXRlY2hlZHUtaW5jLWdvdHUtaW52ZXN0b3JzLXdpdGgtc3Vic3RhbnRpYWwtbG9zc2VzLXRvLWNvbnRhY3QtdGhlLWZpcm3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investor Alert: Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP Reminds Gaotu Techedu Inc.

“We earned a shot to run another race together next week” said Vernon-Verona-Sherrill coach Mike Dunne whose squad previously won a sectional title in 2017.

New Hartford repeated as Class B champions from 2019 in the first race on a sunny day at Vernon-Verona-Sherrill High School. Led by Leah Hilton (21:53.2) Alexandria French (22:05.5) and Kaia Henderson (22:18) who ran fifth sixth and seventh respectively in a field of 77 runners and eight scoring teams the Spartans posted a score of 45 points against runner-up Whitesboro’s 71. Gabby Bashant and Tara Fobare were the other scoring runners for New Hartford and all placed among the first 23 finishers.

Whitesboro’s Caleigh McQueeney (22:41.8) and Emily Lamore (22:42.4) finished immediately behind New Hartford’s lead trio and McQueeney will join the Spartans at the state meet as the fifth and final individual qualifier among the Class B girls.

Camden senior Elizabeth Lucason (19:19.8) won the Class B race. She finished second as a freshman in 2018 and had two previous third-place finishes at sectional meets.

Class A Fayetteville-Manlius Class C South Jefferson and Class D South Lewis were the girls’ other team champions. Oriskany finished second behind South Lewis matching the teams’ top two state rankings and was awarded the Class D-2 championship in split scoring for the section’s largest class.

For the boys Class C Vernon-Verona-Sherrill was joined by Class A Fayetteville-Manlius Class B Jamesville-DeWitt and Class D Beaver River as champions with Fabius-Pompey earning the Class D-2 title.

Keegan Bauer (18:15.5) ran third for Vernon-Verona-Sherrill in a race won by Caeden Cox of Marcellus. The Red Devils had Xander Pelc (18:34.8) Ben Bellinger (18:39.1) and Jordan Wingert (18:48.6) finish seventh eighth and ninth with Joey Banks running 13th to complete the team scoring. Vernon-Verona-Sherrill finished with a team score of 40 easily outdistancing the 93 of No. 2 Skaneateles.

“To win two in five years is really special” Dunne said. “It says a lot about the culture laid down by previous teams.”

The Red Devils will be joined in the boys’ Class B field at states by Holland Patent teammates Richard Zielenski (18:22.3) and Charlie Howe (18:23) individual qualifiers who placed fourth and fifth in Saturday’s race.

Several other area runners were among the individual qualifiers. Oriskany’s Paris Welker (20:49.9) was recognized as the Class D-2 individual champion after running third overall in the Class D race behind South Lewis' Lexi and Brynn Bernard. Welker’s twin sister Gianna ran 10th among 135 finishers on an injured leg and missed out on joining her at states by one spot.

“I would rather (go to states) as a team” said Paris Welker who ran 23rd at the state meet as an individual qualifier as a sophomore two years ago “but it is what it is.

“The weather was really nice – perfect for me.”

Adirondack Wildcats Kaylee Mathis (21:27.6) and Cora Hinsdill (21:30.2) took the girls’ final two individual spots in Class D.

Emily Toth-Ratazzi a Rome Free Academy senior ran second (18:17.5) behind freshman Izzie Sullivan from Fayetteville-Manlius in the Class A race and had junior teammate Marlo Townsend (20:04.8) claim a second spot at the state meet.

Oneida junior Juliana Elberson (21:28.5) and Clinton senior Katherine Stockwell (22:15.7) were state meet qualifiers in Class B where South Jefferson had Alexa Doe and Karsyn Burnash finish 1-2 and three other runners place in the top 11.

Colton Kempney from Beaver River won the boys’ Class D race by 36 seconds and Sean Moran from Bishop Grimes of Syracuse ran 12th as the top Class D-2 finisher. Sauquoit Valley Indian Logan Houck earned a state bid as the fifth overall finisher while teammate Kole Owens finished 10th and missed out by three spots.

Michael McMahon from Syracuse’s Christian Brothers Academy won the boys’ individual competition in Class B. Jerome Seidl of Camden and Anthony Falvo of New Hartford finished sixth and seventh ahead of the top Jamesville-DeWitt finisher but outside the top five spots that go to states.

West Genesee’s Peter McMahon and Liverpool’s Ryan Hagan placed first and second among the Class A boys ahead of five Fayetteville-Manlius runners in the top 10.

Following the announcement of three such projects recently they’re ready to announce the first stretch goals on two of them. (The third — a G.I. Joe Skystriker — already revealed all its goals upfront.) Up first the Ghostbusters proton pack which actually met its 7000 backer goal already.

In the case of the proton pack the first stretch goal includes a part that ought to have been there from the getgo. Yes it’s a hose to connect the pack to a neutrona wand (sold separately). So when the project makes it to 9000 backers as it should easily nobody needs to worry about customizing that. The hose comes in a “classic bundle’ which also includes a sticker sheet specific to the first film. Expect a few of the other stretch goals to include different stickers so fans can pick one or mix and match.

As of this writing the Star Wars Rancor only looks half-funded. But if it gets to 11000 Hasbro will include a Black Series Gamorrean Guard. The figure saw release previously but never became the easiest to obtain. This version however comes with an exclusive collector coin on a special Power of the Force cardback. Sorry no detachable head feature on this one. Unless they’re holding that back for a later goal. The Rancor’s mouth design will allow it to fit the green porcine’s head in its mouth though.

Take a look through the gallery below for some new official images. Then let us know in comments if you’re backing either.

Here the focus stays on the toys which Hasbro basically made a year ago. Images leaked online ever since and now they’re finally here in stores. And for a movie wave of Marvel Legends they’re somewhat unprecedented. Because the film introduces ten new major characters we have one wave of entirely movie-based original sculpted figures seven in all. Collect them to build an eighth get nine and ten as retail exclusives and add one oversized enemy figure and that’s the Eternals Marvel Legends wave. No comics-based characters and no apparent shared body parts. Plus nearly every character features metallic paint.

The Eternals themselves as generic figures may not appeal to kids as much — they’re just people in shiny robes without any cool battle gear. But for collectors the shiny outfits and intricate costume details make this maybe the best Marvel Legends movie wave yet. Especially since it’s the only one in recent memory not to force movie fans to buy at least one unrelated comic figure to build the extra essential character. And toys are a great way to learn new character names. Certainly that’s how the first generation of Star Wars fans learned for example what Dengar and Nien Nunb were called.

Technically only six of the seven need be acquired to build Gilgamesh. Ikaris the most traditionally superheroic in style comes not with bonus parts of his pal but an extra head with laser eyes. And unlike a Cyclops figure with typical beams his laser eye effect manifests in a sort of geometrical emanating ray pattern. It’s more like a Jack Kirby rendering than any manifestation of it onscreen. At two per case Ikaris will be the most common figure on pegs as well.

Thena a Target exclusive also excludes anyone else’s parts instead coming with extra weapons. But while her likeness to Angelina Jolie works she falls victim to “Hasbro didn’t see a finished special effects cut” syndrome. Her weapons look generic rather than the “3-D printed out of thin air gold lattice” style seen onscreen. Gilgamesh also suffers from this — it might have been nice to see him with an energy punch effect. Maybe an add-on accessory kit can come later.

Also Thena’s outfit has a pearlescent effect rather than metallic. Other exceptions include Gilgamesh who’s just mildly shiny and Druig who’s glossy black. They’ll still stand out from other Marvel Legends but maybe not quite as much as the more metal Ikaris Sersi Sprite Phastos and Kingo.

The ninth figure Ajak (Salma Hayek) remained unavailable at press time. A Walmart exclusive she arrived in some physical stores already but online preorders expect to fulfill in December.

Figure ten however is a masterpiece. And significantly cooler than his film counterpart. Kro in his final evolved form as a humanoid Deviant gets maybe 2-3 scenes as such and he’s an obvious digital effect. The figure does an excellent job of making a tangible plastic figure look like CG somehow.

With purple and green iridescence he’s colored like a Japanese beetle unlike the darker version in the film. The forearms can swap out regular hands for essence-draining tendrils that help him evolve from the quadruped creature he portrays for most of the movie’s runtime.

The sculpt detail and paint here are impeccable. Though one wonders if he’d even have gotten a figure if the Hasbro folks had seen the finished film. In comics Kro more resembled a purple Hellboy and had an affair with Thena. Onscreen they fight…briefly.

Phastos and Sersi get longer-than-life necks which can look weird or natural depending on the pose.

Likenesses overall seem very good. Kingo may seem a tad exaggerated at first with his eyes looking extra white and slightly cartoonish. But up close the resemblance looks dead-on. Not quite as dead-on? His finger blasts which bend easily but can be swapped out for regular hands.

Now that this level of detail can be manifested in mass-marketed figures there’s really no excuse for less. Hasbro may have more resources than most but they didn’t up the price on these over the normal $22.99 despite all-individual sculpts and detailed face scans. The larger Kro goes for $31.99 generally. (There’s also a better than average chance Kro was directly made from the digital effects model as many movie-based Transformers toys are). Cynics one might say should eat Kro.

Entertainment Earth still has cases of eight (two Ikaris) for $183.99. As of this writing Target still has Thena in stock. Walmart online still has Ajak waiting for next month. Kro still shows up at Hasbro Pulse and other outlets. (Entertainment Earth is an affiliate partner with Superhero Hype. This site may earn fees based on purchases through site links.)

The smart thing in making Thena and Ajak separate from the rest of the wave is that they’re played by the most famous actresses and may have crossover appeal. With the rest consumers probably will want either all or none.

Except maybe Kro who again just looks cool as hell. Minor role onscreen notwithstanding.

But nearly two months after President Joe Biden initially announced mandates were coming some Palm Beach County hospitals have yet to formulate such rules.

Workers for hospitals participating in Medicaid or Medicare must get the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or both doses of the Moderna or Pfizer regimens by Jan. 4 the White House said. But only six of the 14 hospitals in Palm Beach County have rules mirroring the federal government’s mandate that staff be fully vaccinated or tested weekly for the coronavirus.

Vaccine-or-test requirements have already been in place at Boca Raton Regional Medical Center Bethesda Hospital East in Boynton Beach and Bethesda Hospital West. All three are run by Baptist Health.

The only publicly run hospital in Palm Beach County Lakeside Medical Center in Belle Glade has rules similar to the federal requirements. More than 78% of Lakeside's 285 workers are fully vaccinated spokeswoman Robin Kish said.

But the other eight hospitals have no vaccine mandates.

Jupiter Medical determining 'next steps'; no rules for Tenet hospitals

“We are currently analyzing the rule” Jupiter Medical Center spokeswoman Patti Patrick said in an email about the federal rules. “As we gain a greater understanding of its content we will be able to determine next steps.”

A human resources official for Tenet Healthcare said its hospitals in Palm Beach County — Delray Beach Palm Beach Gardens St. Mary’s West Boca and Good Samaritan medical centers — have no COVID-19 vaccine requirements. Tenet spokesman Ryan Liber has not responded to requests for comment.

Wellington Regional Medical Center would not reveal what percentage of its staff are vaccinated against the deadly airborne virus. “We consider all the information in the request as private and personal” spokesman Allen Poston said last month in an email. He did not respond Thursday to a request for comment on the federal government’s new rules. The hospital’s online job applications make no mention of COVID-19 vaccine requirements.

HCA Healthcare with runs JFK Medical Center and Palms West does not mandate the vaccine for employees. ""We are planning to comply with the federal COVID-19 vaccination requirements"" spokeswoman Kathryn Walton said.

Health-care workers union backs vaccine mandates

The biggest health care workers’ union in Florida now publicly supports the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

“I think after really intensive work by the union to provide education to folks and to answer their concerns as legitimate to try to get people effective information we’ve seen the limits of those voluntary efforts” Dale Ewart Florida executive vice president for United Healthcare Workers East said Thursday. “We believe this is a necessary step” he said.

If an employer fires any of the roughly 5000 union-represented health care workers in Palm Beach County over the mandate there’s little the union can do Ewart indicated. “If employers do those things follow the rules and the mandates from the federal government there really isn't much argument to be made if people choose not to comply.”

“We’d want to make sure that the employer operated within the limits of the (federal) regulations” Ewart said and “that employees who make good-faith medical or religious exemptions have those honored and that employees are given time to comply.

""We’d also expect employers … to make it easy for employees to get vaccinated” such as by giving workers time off to get the shot as stipulated by Biden’s mandate. The federal rules include nursing home workers who have some of the lowest rates of COVID-19 vaccination and lowest rates of pay in health care.

Nursing homes:Lake Worth Beach nursing home workers protest for higher wages

More:Florida records lowest ever COVID-19 positive test rate; death toll surpasses 60000

More than a dozen certified nursing assistants rallied Oct. 28 in Lake Worth Beach for higher pay from their employer Avante at Lake Worth nursing home. The unionized workers said low wages drive away skilled workers leaving remaining staff with workweeks of 100 hours or more.

But just 38% of Avante’s staff are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid reported. The nursing home has similar rules to the federal government: Get vaccinated or face weekly testing.

La Posada Senior Living in Palm Beach Gardens announced in August that it would require staff to get vaccinated. Since then the share of health-care personnel who are fully vaccinated has jumped to 99% from about 55%. Statewide an average of 58% of nursing home staff are inoculated as of Oct. 17 according to CMS.

Some never made it out,"KHN —

They went into hospitals with heart attacks kidney failure or in a psychiatric crisis.

They left with covid-19 — if they left at all.

More than 10000 patients were diagnosed with covid in a U.S. hospital last year after they were admitted for something else according to federal and state records analyzed exclusively for KHN. The number is certainly an undercount since it includes mostly patients 65 and older plus California and Florida patients of all ages.

Yet in the scheme of things that can go wrong in a hospital it is catastrophic: About 21% of the patients who contracted covid in the hospital from April to September last year died the data shows. In contrast nearly 8% of other Medicare patients died in the hospital at the time.

Steven Johnson 66 was expecting to get an infection cut out of his hip flesh and bone at Blake Medical Center in Bradenton Florida in November 2020.

Steven Johnson 66 was expecting to get an infection cut out of his hip flesh and bone at Blake Medical Center in Bradenton Florida last November. The retired pharmacist had survived colon cancer and was meticulous to avoid contracting covid. He could not have known that from April through September 8% of that hospital’s Medicare covid patients were diagnosed with the virus after they were admitted for another concern.

Johnson had tested negative for covid two days before he was admitted. After 13 days in the hospital he tested positive said his wife Cindy Johnson also a retired pharmacist.

Soon he was struggling to clear a glue-like phlegm from his lungs. A medical team could hardly control his pain. They prompted Cindy to share his final wishes. She asked: “Honey do you want to be intubated?” He responded with an emphatic “no.” He died three days later.

After her husband tested positive Cindy Johnson trained in contact tracing quickly got a covid test. She tested negative. Then she thought about the large number of hospital staffers flowing into and out of his room — where he was often unmasked — and suspected a staff member had infected him. That the hospital part of the HCA Healthcare chain still has not mandated staff vaccinations is “appalling” she said.

“I’m furious” she said.

“How can they say on their website” she asked “that the safety precautions ‘we’ve put into place make our facilities among the safest possible places to receive healthcare at this time’?”

Blake Medical Center spokesperson Lisa Kirkland said the hospital is “strongly encouraging vaccination” and noted that it follows Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and federal and state guidelines to protect patients. President Joe Biden has called for all hospital employees to be vaccinated but the requirement could face resistance in a dozen states including Florida that have banned vaccine mandates.

Overall the rate of in-hospital spread among Medicare and other patients was lower than in other countries including the United Kingdom which makes such data public and openly discusses it. On average about 1.7% of U.S. hospitalized covid patients were diagnosed with the virus in U.S. hospitals according to an analysis of Medicare records from April 1 to Sept. 30 2020 provided by Dr. James Kennedy founder of CDIMD a Nashville-based consulting and data analytics company.

Yet the rate of infection was far higher in 38 hospitals where 5% or more of the Medicare covid cases were documented as hospital-acquired. The data is from a challenging stretch last year when protective gear was in short supply and tests were scarce or slow to produce results. The Medicare data for the fourth quarter of 2020 and this year isn’t available yet and the state data reflects April 1 through Dec. 31 2020.

A KHN review of work-safety records medical literature and interviews with staff at high-spread hospitals points to why the virus took hold: Hospital leaders were slow to appreciate its airborne nature which made coughing patients hazardous to roommates and staff members who often wore less-protective surgical masks instead of N95s. Hospitals failed to test every admitted patient enabled by CDC guidance that leaves such testing to the “discretion of the facility.” Management often failed to inform workers when they’d been exposed to covid and so were at risk of spreading it themselves.

Spread among patients and staffers seemed to go hand in hand. At Beaumont Hospital Taylor in Michigan 139 employee covid infections were logged between April 6 to Oct. 20 last year a hospital inspection report shows. Nearly 7% of the Medicare patients with covid tested positive after they were admitted to that hospital for something else the federal data shows. A hospital spokesperson said tests were not available to screen all patients last year resulting in some late diagnoses. He said all incoming patients are tested now.

Tracking covid inside health facilities is no new task to federal officials who publicly report new staff and resident cases weekly for each U.S. nursing home. Yet the Department of Health and Human Services reports data on covid’s spread in hospitals only on a statewide basis so patients are in the dark about which facilities have cases.

KHN commissioned analyses of hospital billing records which are also used more broadly to spot various hospital-acquired infections. For covid the data has limitations. It can pick up some community-acquired cases that were slow to show up as it can take two to 14 days from exposure to the virus for symptoms to appear with the average being four to five days. The records do not account for cases picked up in an emergency room or diagnosed after a hospital patient was discharged.

Linda Moore 71 tested positive at least 15 days into a hospital stay for spinal surgery according to her daughter Trisha Tavolazzi. Her mother was at Havasu Regional Medical Center in Lake Havasu City Arizona which did not have a higher-than-average rate of internal spread last summer.

The hospital implemented “rigorous health and safety protocols to protect all of our patients” during the pandemic said hospital spokesperson Corey Santoriello who would not comment on Moore’s case citing privacy laws.

Moore was airlifted to another hospital where her condition only declined further her daughter said. After the ventilator was removed she clung to life fitfully for 5½ hours as her daughter prayed for her mother to find her way to heaven.

“I asked her mom and her dad and her family and prayed to God ‘Please just come show her the way’” Tavolazzi said. “I relive it every day.”

When Tavolazzi sought answers from the hospital about where her mom got the virus she said she got none: “No one ever called me back.”

Two Negative Covid Tests Then ‘Patient Zero’

As the second surge of covid subsided last September doctors from the prestigious Brigham and Women’s Hospital published a reassuring study: With careful infection control only two of 697 covid patients acquired the virus within the Boston hospital. That is about 0.3% of patients ― about six times lower than the overall Medicare rate. Brigham tested every patient it admitted exceeding CDC recommendations. It was transparent and open about safety concerns.

But the study published in the high-profile JAMA Network Open journal conveyed the wrong message according to Dr. Manoj Jain an infectious-disease physician and adjunct professor at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. Covid was spreading in hospitals he said and the study buried “the problem under the rug.”

Before the virtual ink on the study was dry the virus began a stealthy streak through the elite hospital. It slipped in with a patient who tested negative twice ― but turned out to be positive. She was “patient zero” in an outbreak affecting 38 staffers and 14 patients according to a study in Annals of Internal Medicine initially published Feb. 9.

That study’s authors sequenced the genome of the virus to confirm which cases were related ― and precisely how it traveled through the hospital.

As patients were moved from room to room in the early days of the outbreak covid spread among roommates 8 out of 9 times likely through aerosol transmission the study says. A survey of staff members revealed that those caring for coughing patients were more likely to get sick.

The virus also appeared to have breached the CDC-OK’d protective gear. Two staff members who had close patient contact while wearing a surgical mask and face shield still wound up infected. The findings suggested that more-protective N95 respirators could help safeguard staff.

Brigham and Women’s now tests every patient upon admission and again soon after. Nurses are encouraged to test again if they see a subtle sign of covid said Dr. Erica Shenoy associate chief of the Infection Control Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital who helped craft policy at Brigham.

She said nurses and environmental services workers are at the table for policymaking: “I personally make it a point to say ‘Tell me what you’re thinking’” Shenoy said. “‘There’s no retribution because we need to know.’”

CDC guidelines though left wide latitude on protective gear and testing. To this day Shenoy said hospitals employ a wide range of policies.

The CDC said in a statement that its guidelines “provide a comprehensive and layered approach to preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings” and include testing patients with “even mild symptoms” or recent exposure to someone with covid.

Infection control policies are rarely apparent to patients or visitors beyond whether they’re asked to wear a mask. But reviews of public records and interviews with more than a dozen people show that at hospitals with high rates of covid spread staff members were often alarmed by the lack of safety practices.

Nurses Sound the Alarm on Covid Spread

As covid crept into Florida in spring 2020 nurse Victoria Holland clashed with managers at Blake Medical Center in Bradenton where Steven Johnson died.

She said managers suspended her early in the pandemic after taking part in a protest and “having a hissy fit” when she was denied a new N95 respirator before an “aerosol-generating” procedure. The CDC warns that such procedures can spread the virus through the air. Before the pandemic nurses were trained to dispose of an N95 after each patient encounter.

When the suspension was over Holland said she felt unsafe. “They told us nothing” she said. “It was all a little whisper between the doctors. You had potential covids and you’d get a little surgical mask because [they didn’t] want to waste” an N95 unless they knew the patient was positive.

Holland said she quit in mid-April. Her nursing colleagues lodged a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in late June alleging that staff “working around possible Covid-19 positive cases” had been denied PPE. Staff members protested outside the hospital in July and filed another OSHA complaint that said the hospital was allowing covid-exposed employees to keep working.

Kirkland the Blake spokesperson said the hospital responded to OSHA and “no deficiencies were identified.”

The Medicare analysis shows that 22 of 273 patients with covid or 8% were diagnosed with the virus after they were admitted to Blake. That’s about five times as high as the national average.

Kirkland said “there is no standard way for measuring COVID-19 hospital-associated transmissions” and “there is no evidence to suggest the risk of transmission at Blake Medical Center is different than what you would find at other hospitals.”

In Washington D.C. 34 Medicare covid patients contracted the virus at MedStar Washington Hospital Center or nearly 6% of its total the analysis shows.

Unhappy with the safety practices ― which included gas sterilization and reuse of N95s — National Nurses United members protested on the hospital lawn in July 2020. At the protest nurse Zoe Bendixen said one nurse had died of the virus and 50 had gotten sick: “[Nurses] can become a source for spreading the disease to other patients co-workers and family members.”

Nurse Yuhana Gidey said she caught covid after treating a patient who turned out to be infected. Another nurse ― not managers doing contact tracing ― told her she’d been exposed she said.

Nurse Kimberly Walsh said in an interview there was an outbreak in a geriatric unit where she worked in September 2020. She said management blamed nurses for bringing the virus into the unit. But Walsh pointed to another problem: The hospital wasn’t covid-testing patients coming in from nursing homes where spread was rampant last year.

MedStar declined a request for an interview about its infection control practices and did not respond to specific questions.

While hospitals must track and publicly report rates of persistent infections like C. diff antibiotic-resistant staph and surgical site infections similar hospital-acquired covid rates are not reported.

KHN examined a different source of data that Congress required hospitals to document about “hospital-acquired conditions.” The Medicare data which notes whether each covid case was “present on admission” or not becomes available months after a hospitalization in obscure files that require a data-use agreement typically granted to researchers. KHN counted cases as federal officials do in some instances in which the documentation is deemed insufficient to categorize a case (see data methodology below).

For this data whether to deem a covid case hospital-acquired lies with medical coders who review doctors’ notes and discharge summaries and ask doctors questions if the status is unclear said Sue Bowman senior director of coding policy and compliance at American Health Information Management Association.

She said medical coders are aware that the data is used for hospital quality measures and would be careful to review the contract tracing or other information in the medical record.

If a case was in the data KHN used “that would mean it was acquired during the hospital stay either from a health care worker or another patient or maybe if a hospital allowed visitors from a visitor” Bowman said. “That would be a fair interpretation of the data.”

The high death rate for those diagnosed with covid during a hospital stay — about 21% — mirrors the death rate for other Medicare covid patients last year when doctors had few proven methods to help patients. It also highlights the hazard unvaccinated staffers pose to patients said Jain the infectious-disease doctor. The American Hospital Association estimates that about 42% of U.S. hospitals have mandated that all staff members be vaccinated.

“We don’t need [unvaccinated staff] to be a threat to patients” Jain said. “[Hospital] administration is too afraid to push the nursing staff and the general public is clueless at what a threat a non-vaccinated person poses to a vulnerable population.”

Cindy Johnson believes her husband Steven caught covid-19 from staff at Blake Medical Center in Bradenton Florida in November 2020. After his death she asked a doctor who sees patients at the hospital to take down the big ""OPEN & SAFE"" sign outside. (Cindy Johnson) Cindy Johnson/KHN

Cindy Johnson said the hospital where she believes her husband contracted covid faced minimal scrutiny in a state inspection even after she said she reported that he caught covid there. She explored suing but an attorney told her it would be nearly impossible to win such a case. A 2021 state law requires proof of “at least gross negligence” to prevail in court.

Johnson did ask a doctor who sees patients at the hospital for this: Please take down the big “OPEN & SAFE” sign outside.

Within days the sign was gone.",,,

The Washington Capitals announced Saturday afternoon that Aliaksei Protas has been re-assigned to Hershey. Protas 20 made his NHL debut on Monday in Tampa Bay. The Bears host the Providence Bruins tonight at Giant Center.

MORE FROM THE CAPITALS

ARLINGTON Va. – The Washington Capitals have re-assigned center Aliaksei Protas to the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL) senior vice president and general manager Brian MacLellan announced today.

Protas 20 made his NHL debut on Monday in Tampa Bay. Prior to his recall Protas recorded four points (1g 3a) in six games with Hershey this season.

The 6’6″ 225-pound center recorded 18 points (10g 8a) in 58 regular season games with Dinamo Minsk during the 2020-21 season.

The Washington Capitals recalled two-way forward Axel Jonsson-Fjallby from the AHL’s Hershey Bears on Sunday.

The move comes the day after the Capitals lost to the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1 and dropped to 5-2-4 on the season.

This marks Jonsson-Fjallby’s first NHL callup.

The Capitals are without top six talents Nicklas Backstrom (hip) TJ Oshie (foot) and Anthony Mantha (shoulder) and already sport three rookie forwards in the lineup currently: Connor McMichael Hendrix Lapierre and Brett Leason.

Jonsson-Fjallby a 2016 fifth-round pick has seven points (3g 4a) in nine games with Hershey this season as part of a talented third line with Leason (who is currently in Washington) and Aliaksei Protas (made NHL debut last week). According to the Bears Jonsson-Fjallby has scored two game-winning goals already in 2021-22 a mark tied for first in the AHL.

AJF initially was not slated to be on the Capitals this year. He was claimed on waivers by the Buffalo Sabres during the preseason when the Capitals tried to sneak him down to Hershey. The Capitals re-claimed the Swede back seven days later when the Sabres tried to send him to their own AHL team.

In other words certain elite members may be eligible for room upgrades but there’s not much published in terms of the order in which elite members are upgraded.

Along those lines here are some interesting insights regarding Hilton Honors elite upgrades…

Hilton upgrades award stays before elite members

Hilton Honors recently started rolling out automated elite upgrades in advance whereby elite members can be upgraded up to 72 hours prior to arrival. This is a cool feature especially since it’s automated so it takes some of the guessing out of the upgrade process.

Here’s an interesting twist though. LoyaltyLobby reports what the alleged upgrade priority is for these automated upgrades. Here’s the priority order according to this report:

Hilton Honors redemption stays costing more than 100000 points total are prioritized first; it doesn’t matter how long the stay is as long as more than 100000 points are redeemed

Lifetime Hilton Honors Diamond members are prioritized next

Non-lifetime Hilton Honors Diamond members are prioritized after that

Hilton Honors Gold members are prioritized after that

This seems to just apply to the automated upgrade process — it’s anyone’s guess the extent to which this is followed for upgrades on the day of arrival.

Those redeeming lots of points have the highest upgrade priority

Why this is so interesting and surprising

There are a couple of things about Hilton Honors’ automated upgrade priority that are noteworthy.

First of all lifetime Diamond members are upgraded ahead of non-lifetime Diamond members. Personally I think that’s how it should be — those members are as loyal as they get and they should be rewarded as such. Nonetheless programs like Marriott Bonvoy and World of Hyatt don’t prioritize upgrades for lifetime elite members (at least officially) even though I think they should. Kudos to Hilton for that.

The much more interesting thing here is that those redeeming more than 100000 Hilton Honors points are upgraded ahead of everyone else:

This only applies when redeeming more than 100000 Hilton Honors points for a stay which seems like a rather odd line to draw; so if you stay at a hotel costing 50000 points per night you’d be prioritized for upgrades if you stay two nights but not one night?

It also seems a bit odd to upgrade a non-elite member on an award stay over a lifetime Diamond member paying cash

Many hotels seem to treat those redeeming points as second class guests and that’s never a nice way to feel when redeeming your hard earned points; so I respect Hilton for the idea behind this which is to make those redeeming their points feel rewarded and valued

At the same time Hilton Honors is taking it to the extreme by upgrading non-elite members redeeming points ahead of elite members paying cash

Lifetime Diamond members have priority over other Diamond members

Bottom line

Hilton Honors recently rolled out automated elite upgrades whereby some upgrades start to clear 72 hours before a stay. This is an awesome feature since it takes the last minute guessing game out of upgrades.

What’s most noteworthy here is the order in which upgrades allegedly clear — not only are lifetime Diamond members upgraded ahead of other Diamond members but those redeeming 100K+ Hilton Honors points per stay are upgraded ahead of everyone else.

What do you make of Hilton Honors’ alleged automated upgrade order?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hhZWxhbHBpbmVyLzIwMjEvMTEvMDcvZmludGVjaC1leGVjLWFuZHJlYXMtdmV6b25pay1waWNrcy1oaWdoLXdvcnRoLWRlc3RpbmF0aW9ucy1mb3ItdHJhdmVsLXJlY292ZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fintech Exec Andreas Vezonik Picks High-Worth Destinations For Travel Recovery,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelalpiner/2021/11/07/fintech-exec-andreas-vezonik-picks-high-worth-destinations-for-travel-recovery/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hhZWxhbHBpbmVyLzIwMjEvMTEvMDcvZmludGVjaC1leGVjLWFuZHJlYXMtdmV6b25pay1waWNrcy1oaWdoLXdvcnRoLWRlc3RpbmF0aW9ucy1mb3ItdHJhdmVsLXJlY292ZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vaG9sbHl3b29kbGlmZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNi9wYXJpcy1oaWx0b24tY29uZmlybXMta2ltLWthcmRhc2hpYW4taW52aXRlZC13ZWRkaW5nLXZpZGVvL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vaG9sbHl3b29kbGlmZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNi9wYXJpcy1oaWx0b24tY29uZmlybXMta2ltLWthcmRhc2hpYW4taW52aXRlZC13ZWRkaW5nLXZpZGVvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paris Hilton Confirms Kim Kardashian’s Invited To Her Wedding — But Won’t Say If Pete Davidson’s Her Plus 1,"Paris Hilton confirmed that Kim Kardashian is on the guest list for her upcoming wedding to Carter Reum — but she had nothing to say about her friend’s rumored beau Pete Davidson. A TMZ photographer caught the TV personality 40 as she left clothing shop Alice + Olivia in Beverly Hills on Friday Nov. 5. When asked if Kim 41 received an invite Paris nodded yes; but when asked if Pete 27 would be her plus one she remained mum as seen in the video HERE.

The photographer proceeded to ask the hotel heiress what she thought about the rumored romance — and if she thought it was “just a fling” — but she paid no mind to the questions remaining quiet as she snapped selfies with fans outside of the store. She then got into the waiting SUV nearby no doubt to continue preparations for her upcoming nuptials to her venture capitalist fiancé 40.

Paris and Carter who got engaged in February after a year of dating will tie the knot on November 11. The couple will reportedly host the reception at the Bel Air estate of Paris’ late grandfather Barron Hilton the son of the late Conrad Hilton founder of the Hilton Hotels chain. The couple’s extravagant $60k+ wedding registry was made public last month. Paris and Carter are registered at Gearys Beverly Hills.

Among the luxe items on the list? A $500 Hermés platter $4885 Baccarat vase and $1000 William Yeoward Crystal caviar server. It is unclear which gift Kim fulfilled but of course her invitation to the opulent wedding comes as no surprise. The friends have known each other for decades: pre-Keeping Up With the Kardashians fame Kim famously worked as Paris’ assistant and stylist in the early 2000s.

While her longtime pal remained quiet about her plus one a source told Page Six that Kim will not be bringing the comedian. “She will be there solo” the source said. The two — who met when Kim hosted the October 9 episode of Saturday Night Live — first sparked romance rumors after they visited Knott’s Scary Farm with friends on October 29. Post-theme park outing the two reportedly had dinner multiple times in New York this week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vamV3aXNoam91cm5hbC5jb20vY29tbWVudGFyeS9ibG9ncy8zNDIxMzIvdGhhbmsteW91LWlwdy0yMDIxLXJlc29ydHMtd29ybGQtbGFzLXZlZ2FzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thank you IPW 2021 Resorts World Las Vegas,"Thank you USA Travel IPW 2021!

View the current offers here.

In case you missed it South Africa's borders are open to all travelers.

With most tourism in South Africa revolving around Cape Town Johannesburg (more commonly known as Jo'burg or Jozi) is an afterthought for many tourists. While it's still important for visitors to be mindful of their surroundings most of the neighborhoods you'd want to spend time in are typically safe and offer an experience as diverse as the city itself.

Home to emerging arts music culinary and fashion scenes it's hard to imagine ever getting bored in this vibrant destination.

Although there aren't necessarily as many options for getting there or staying there using points and miles as you might hope doing so is not impossible.

Here are three ways points and miles could help you see the city depending on your budget and your interests.

Getting there

With tickets from the U.S. to Johannesburg (JNB) regularly costing over $1000 round-trip even economy awards could get you serious value from your points. Regardless of your preferred transferable points currency or airline alliance you should be able to book your flights for 80000 miles or less round-trip.

Your best bet would usually be to fly United and book through its MileagePlus program which you can transfer points to from Chase Ultimate Rewards with a card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred. With South African Airways no longer flying to the U.S. United currently offers one of the only nonstop connections between the United States and South Africa.

Although the program technically doesn't publish award charts it usually charges just 80000 miles round-trip for its nonstop flights out of Newark (EWR). If there's no saver availability economy class awards on Turkish Lufthansa or Swiss are solid alternatives and typically cost a reasonable 88000 miles round-trip.

The second nonstop flight option is offered by Delta out of Atlanta (ATL). Although Delta also uses more variable award pricing you can often score economy awards for 70000 to 80000 SkyMiles round-trip — especially during the low season from March to May and September to November. Delta SkyMiles is a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards so you can transfer points earned with cards like The Platinum Card® from American Express.

Where to stay

While Johannesburg isn't home to as many points hotels from the major chains as let's say London or Dubai most of them can be booked for very low rates. One of the best neighborhoods in which you could stay is Melrose and Marriott Bonvoy a 1:1 transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards has three terrific low-cost properties you could choose from there.

If you're looking to minimize the number of points you need to spend then you'll want to stay at the Category 1 Protea Hotel Johannesburg Wanderers where award rooms are available for just 5000 to 10000 points per night.

If you'd like something a little nicer but still on a budget you could stay at the Category 2 Protea Hotel Fire & Ice Johannesburg Melrose Arch or Johannesburg Marriott Hotel Melrose Arch; both of these properties are just 10000 to 15000 points per night. Don't let their low price tags fool you — these hotels are much more glamorous than your run-of-the-mill low-category hotels in the U.S. And remember you could score even lower rates by leveraging Marriott's fifth night free benefit.

If it's properties under the IHG Rewards Club umbrella that you seek two solid picks would be the Holiday Inn

Johannesburg Sunnyside Park and the Holiday Inn Johannesburg Rosebank. Award nights at these properties are usually 13000 to 16000 points per night. That said if you want something a little nicer you might want to consider the soon-to-open voco Johannesburg Rosebank for 26000 points per night.

There are some other Holiday Inns further afield but the prices are comparable to the more central ones so you might want to skip those.

Moderate

While Johannesburg has some slightly nicer hotels at which you could stay the biggest difference a few more points can get you is a higher class of service for your flights. Since you're keeping some cash in your pocket by using points and miles you may also want to put some of those savings toward a day safari. The Dinokeng and Plumari game reserves have rich wildlife and are both just an hour's drive away from the city.

Getting there

As you might guess there are some fantastic business and first-class products you could fly to Africa. But before we dive into them let's take a look at an economic alternative that's frequently overlooked: premium economy. Although premium economy seats are far from lie-flat the few extra inches of space additional recline and improved service could help significantly on longer flights like those to Africa.

Related: Airlines that offer premium economy awards

We typically stray away from using points and miles for British Airways flights due to the outrageous surcharges the airline tacks onto award tickets but BA premium economy is likely Oneworld flyers' best option when it comes to flying premium economy to Africa.

However rather than book through BA itself you'll want to book through Cathay Pacific's Asia Miles program a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards Citi ThankYou Rewards and Capital One. A round-trip premium economy ticket on BA costs 130000 miles and best of all the surcharges can be roughly 50% less when using Asia Miles compared to booking with any other program.

Another option is premium economy on Virgin Atlantic which is best booked through the airline's own Flying Club mileage program. The program is a 1:1 transfer partner of several major transferable currencies so it's easy to stockpile a ton of miles.

It's also not uncommon for Amex and Citi to offer lucrative transfer bonuses to Virgin Atlantic. Awards from the U.S. cost between 85000-105000 miles round-trip but unfortunately you'll need to cough up around $1000 in surcharges. You could pay lower fees by booking your award through Delta but you'll probably spend far more miles.

Where to stay

A popular but more business-oriented neighborhood in which you could stay is Sandton. Between the Sandton City Shopping Mall and Nelson Mandela Square (a European-style piazza) this area is considered the fashion capital of the continent. As you'd expect from a business district Sandton is home to many of the city's major chain hotels.

IHG Rewards Club members can redeem around 37000 points per night to stay at the highly-rated InterContinental Johannesburg Sandton Towers. Unlike some other hotels in the area which only cater to business travelers leisure travelers will enjoy the hotel's full spa restaurant with nightly live jazz music and skybridge walkway to the Sandton City Shopping Mall.

Located just a few steps away is the Hilton Sandton. Rooms here go for 20000 to 25000 points per night which is reasonable but the rooms feel like they could be at any nice Hilton in the world — which isn't necessarily a bad thing for some people.

If you have some Radisson Rewards points to burn consider staying at the Radisson RED Johannesburg Rosebank where awards set you back 30000 points per night. The rooms are stylish and the hotel even has a rooftop pool and bar.

Alternatively you can book the Radisson Blu Hotel Sandton or Radisson Blu Gautrain Hotel which are each 45000 points per night. Although the two hotels are just down the street from each other they offer two very different experiences. The Radisson Blu Hotel Sandton is on the more traditional side and has a South African flair; meanwhile the Radisson Blu Gautrain Hotel sports a more modern look.

Luxury

While Johannesburg isn't known for being the most aspirational destination for your points and miles you can still use them for a lavish experience in the city. The best part is that you don't need to break the bank to stay in some of Jo'burg's best hotels so once again the biggest difference a few more points will get you is a more comfortable ride there and back.

Getting there

While premium economy is a big step up from economy unless you're flying nonstop you'll likely be spending at least 20 hours traveling to get to Johannesburg from the U.S. so it's an ideal time to splurge for business or first class if you can.

In the glory days Emirates first class was hands-down the best way to get to Africa on points. However Emirates started limiting first-class awards to partner airlines and charges exorbitant rates through its own program so that isn't really the case anymore. That said Lufthansa first class certainly isn't a bad alternative and the carrier recently started releasing this award space to partners up to 30 days before departure.

Lufthansa first class doesn't feature onboard showers or bars but it's consistently great and definitely ranks up there with some of the best in the world. Pro tip: During your layover in Frankfurt (FRA) you'll want to check out the famous First Class Terminal as opposed to the First Class Lounge.

If you know the tricks Lufthansa first class is surprisingly easy to book with miles -- when space is available. Air Canada's Aeroplan charges 180000 to 260000 miles for a round-trip award from North America while Avianca's LifeMiles program charges a flat 210000 miles. These redemptions are fantastic considering that cash rates often top $10000.

Aeroplan is a 1:1 transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards and Capital One. Meanwhile LifeMiles partners with American Express Capital One and Citi ThankYou Rewards. In other words racking up the miles you need with either program should be a breeze with cards like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card or the Citi Premier® Card (see rates and fees). Plus you'll regularly see lucrative bonuses for purchasing LifeMiles. Just remember that Lufthansa only releases first-class award space to partner programs 30 days before departure.

If you recently opened a Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® (see rates and fees) or have simply been stocking up on American miles all these years an alternative would be to book a Qatar Airways business class award through the AAdvantage program. Most long-haul aircraft feature the airline's top-notch Qsuite business class which is one of the world's best. A round-trip award will set you back 150000 miles and these awards can be booked directly through American's site.

Where to stay

If you've got Marriott Bonvoy points to burn the Ten Bompas Hotel is a perfect choice. The secluded all-suite hotel has just ten rooms each decorated by different Jozi designers. It's also home to Winehouse an intimate French restaurant with an extensive wine cellar. Rooms cost 30000 to 40000 Bonvoy points per night which feels like a steal.

For Hyatt loyalists there's the Hyatt Regency Johannesburg though it's temporarily closed until at least April 2022. As with many of Jo'burg's higher-end hotels the Hyatt Regency isn't overly luxurious but it's comfortable offers great amenities and is conveniently located in the upscale Rosebank suburb. At a mere 6500 to 9000 points per night you should have no trouble squeezing value from your points at this hotel.

Other considerations

If you don't want to stay at a major chain property and are willing to pay outright for part of your trip you could save considerable cash by leveraging Amex's Fine Hotels & Resorts collection or Chase's Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection program. By booking through these programs cardholders of premium Amex credit cards (like the Amex Platinum and The Business Platinum Card® from American Express) and premium Chase cards (like the Chase Sapphire Reserve and United Club Infinite Card) can score valuable on-property perks like room upgrades free daily breakfast late check-out credits for spa and dining and more.

If you're looking to stay at a hotel that participates in both programs such as the Saxon Hotel you'll typically want to book through FHR because it guarantees 4:00 p.m. check-out (as opposed to being subject to availability).

Bottom line

South Africa is probably high on many award travelers' bucket lists and while Cape Town and the country's numerous safaris get most of the attention Johannesburg is still well worth a visit.

Whether you're planning a bare-bones trip splurging for a luxury vacation or wanting something in the middle the city has something for all budgets using your hard-earned points and miles."

It tells the story of a woman (Alexis Martinez) from New York City who was on the verge of giving up dating until she met the 12 foot tall skeleton from Home Depot. It was love at first sight.

Dating in New York was never easy. after years rotating between finance bros tech guys and Bushwick dudes with no bed frame I was ready to give up. Then I finally met someone. He wasn’t like the others. He was different. He was tall. He had great bone structure. I was never much of a believer in love at first sight but when i first met the 12-foot skeleton from Home Depot it was like wow this might actually be the one.

Someone Out There Wants It. (Published 2021),"Many people might look at a vintage lilac-and-green bathroom and see a space begging to be gutted. But those people are not Emilie Carver a Cleveland lawyer who hopped on a plane last May and flew to Boston to retrieve 600 tiles from a bathroom that was being renovated.

Ms. Carver 40 had almost given up her dream of recreating a 1930s bathroom in the pale shade of purple when she spotted the tiles in the background of a Facebook Marketplace listing selling old fixtures. About a month later she was in Boston trying to find a rental car with a trunk big enough to haul her loot back to her house in Cleveland a 1930s Tudor revival.

“I was like ‘those are my tiles that’s my tile that’s what I want’” Ms. Carver said of her initial reaction to the listing. Now that the $1-a-piece tiles are in her garage Ms. Carver has to figure out how to scrape the old mortar off the backs so she can recreate a period-appropriate powder room in a space that had been updated by a previous owner.

“I am excited to get it done but I’m also a little nervous because I’ve been thinking about it for so long” she said of the room which will feature wallpaper in lilac and green a tropical print she chose for its unique ability to tie the tile colors together. “Of course it’s going to come out kitschy because that’s what it is.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd2bHQudHYvMjAyMS8xMS8wNy92ZXRlcmFucy1kYXktZnJlZWJpZXMtc3BlY2lhbC1kZWFscy1hcm91bmQtZWFzdC10ZW5uL9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd2bHQudHYvMjAyMS8xMS8wNy92ZXRlcmFucy1kYXktZnJlZWJpZXMtc3BlY2lhbC1kZWFscy1hcm91bmQtZWFzdC10ZW5uLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Veterans Day freebies and special deals around East Tenn.,"KNOXVILLE Tenn.

“It’s been a long a long time coming but I know a change gonna come” sang Robert Johnson at the end of Thursday night’s JustUs Monologues a soulful rendition of Sam Cooke’s song “A Change Is Gonna Come.”

The performance capped a night of vulnerability courage and honesty as formerly incarcerated community members gave accounts of life in the U.S. prison system. The performers spoke on a need for change in the justice system promoting restorative justice and compassion as a means to rehabilitation for those facing life-long consequences for poor choices.

Motus Theater’s JustUs Monologues present men who share autobiographical performances of their experience in the U.S. penal system. These men of color don’t shirk their own responsibility or deny their accountability — each one takes ownership of their mistakes their faults and the decisions that led them into the criminal justice system.

“I hope the stories of myself and my colleagues can become the impetus to affect positive change in the criminal justice system” said JustUS Monologist and Project Strategist Juaquin Mobley.

On the stage of the Longmont Museum’s Stewart Auditorium three men shared tragic tales of life in the criminal justice system. Stories of the lasting consequences of making the wrong decisions the psychological toll of incarceration and the ramifications of a rehabilitative system that dehumanizes its wards.

The performance at the museum brought monologists Dereck Bell and Daniel Guillory to share their stories of addiction incarceration and recidivism joined by Colorado jazz musicians Robert Johnson and Victor Mestas. Accompanying the two monologues two local leaders — NAACP Executive Committee Member Madelyn Strong Woodley and Boulder County Commissioner Marta Loachamin — read Mobley’s story “Unhireable.”

The JustUs Project is about vulnerability and finding the paths to reform a criminal justice system that dehumanizes inmates stripping them of a name and reducing them to a number. Instead of rehabilitation most residents of the Department of Corrections are confronted with more violence illicit behavior and increasingly poor living conditions and overcrowding.

Motus Theater’s Creative Director Kirsten Wilson started the JustUS Project as part of a 17-week workshop for formerly incarcerated people guiding them through story development public speaking and therapeutic catharsis so those men could share their stories from the frontlines of the penal system.

Guillory said when the project started each of the nine men involved were divided and guarded — defensive habits from experience in prison. The vulnerability and openness with each other helped break down the self-erected barriers and start to heal. Guillory Bell and Mobley laughed affectionately about Wilson “suckering them” into opening up.

“That’s where we get our power — in opening up to reveal our true selves and our hearts and hurts” Guillory said. “You’re not allowed to do that in the joint you can’t show any vulnerability.”

The rights of felons vary from state to state but in many states convicted felons lose their right to vote travel abroad and own firearms. Felons in Colorado cannot vote while incarcerated or on parole according to the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office. Felons also face hurdles when applying for housing and employment though the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against felons unrelated to the employment — a convicted child abuser could be barred from teaching a felony DUI could be barred from driving jobs.

According to the Center for American Progress 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. have some sort of criminal record while 9 in 10 employers and 4 in 5 landlords use background checks to bar applicants with criminal records.

Mobley’s story as read by Loachamin and Woodley recounts the struggle to find work and support a family while on probation from a felony drug conviction at the age of 18. Being on probation threatened access to public housing for him and his grandparents — with whom he lived. The struggles didn’t stop there as the felony kept Mobley from a job at Home Depot or finding any job due to the difficulties African-American men face finding work without a felony let alone with one.

The civic leaders read Mobley’s story as a way to model civic hospitality and speak with empathy and without judgement from another’s perspective. After the reading Loachamin and Woodley had an opportunity to comment on Mobley’s tale. Both civic leaders commended Mobley for the courage and bravery in not only writing down his story but making the vulnerability public. Mobley responded with honesty and gratitude for Loachamin and Woodley and their willingness to see beyond their own perspective.

“I think Juaquin is the example that so many of our young men need to see” Woodley said speaking of his vulnerability and personal responsibility.

Loachamin said she would take the experience of the JustUS stories and bring those conversations into her role as county commissioner in Boulder County to guide resource allocation and services offered in the county.

Guillory’s monologue “Truth Not Facts” recalled his struggle of addiction incarceration and the loss of hope. How his mother took out a loan to post bail only to find himself confronted with his own drug addiction hopelessness and the power of a mother’s love. When his mother caught him with narcotics Guillory remembered how his mother supported him unconditionally instead of rejecting him. In his monologue Guillory emphasized the vulnerability and defenselessness he felt in the face of love instead of admonishment.

“That’s the thing that we gotta convey to society. It’s when a person is broken messed up and deserves love the least that is exactly when they need it most” Guillory said.

Bell’s story “Belly of the Beast” is about the best of intentions leading to the worst of consequences and how misplaced loyalty landed him in a world of violence he was unprepared for. Bell took ownership of the actions that led him to incarceration while asking about the corrections officers judges and prosecutors complicitness and contribution to the violence of prisons.

While incarcerated Bell defended himself against an attack that would have killed him. If it weren’t for a corrections officer testifying that Bell acted in self-defense Bell would have faced life in prison for attempted murder.

“And even though I was determined not guilty the criminal justice system still took my innocence away because they put me in a position where to survive I had to stab a man in the neck. And his blood was just pouring out of his body all over me — all over me — and it should be all over the judge DA and prosecutors — them too! And that is not the worst of it” Bell said.

A running thread through all three monologues is how the criminal justice system takes one criminal action and turns it into an identity. Inmates under the ward of the Department of Corrections are referred to by a number instead of a name.

“The fact is all of us in prison are human beings who committed crimes but that is not our truth. We are not ontologically criminal. That is not our essence” Guillory said. “And instead of helping us return to the full truth of who we are the criminal justice system takes away our names gives us DOC numbers and robs of of our dignity freedom happiness and most of all the potential to be our best selves — who we could have been if someone had tried to nurture us instead of neuter us.”

Mobley called the work to reform the criminal justice system a community-saving mission. The path forward is through practices like restorative justice the monologists said and humanizing those people who enter into the criminal justice system.

“Restorative justice is the pathway to success in leading us out of the dark tunnel of criminal justice” Mobley said.

The JustUs Monologues will perform locally at Lafayette’s Arts HUB on Nov. 13. Motus Theater will return to the Stewart Auditorium on Nov. 14 with a screening of Rocks Karma Arrows a multimedia look at Boulder history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGVydG93bm1hbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNy9wb2xpY2UtbG9nLW1vbmV5LXNlbnQtaW4tc2NhbS1yZWNvdmVyZWQtc3V2LXN0b2xlbi1mcm9tLXdhdGVydG93bi1ob21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police Log: Money Sent in Scam Recovered SUV Stolen from Watertown Home,"The following information was provided by the Watertown Police Department.

The brand which is licensed by Resideo and spun off from Honeywell in 2018 already has support for Apple's smart home system in its T5 thermostat also known as the Lyric T5 but that device doesn't have external sensors. Sensors can help make sure you are comfortable in the room you are in rather than simply maintaining the desired temperature where the thermostat is.



As Verge editor Dan Seifert wrote in his Honeywell T9 review its sensors are very good and can measure humidity in addition to temperature something neither Nest nor Ecobee remote sensors can do. They can also detect movement and presence and will adjust the system to the rooms where it detects people. The T9 costs $ 199 and comes with a remote sensor in the box with support for up to 20.

As per Resideo with the HomeKit integration users can control their Honeywell Home T9 smart thermostat using Siri or with the Apple Home app. Once connected you can use automation to adjust the temperature or ask Siri to do it for you. Unlike the Ecobee Smart Thermostat there is no built-in voice assistant so you must use a HomePod Mini iPhone iPad or Apple Watch to invoke the assistant. Resideo did not specify whether it will be able to use temperature or sensor movement to trigger routines in the Home app. Honeywell Home T9 is already compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Home.

Whether this really matters remains to be seen considering that smart thermostats are in Matter's first specification (the new smart home standard that promises to unify connected devices in our home). Resideo is on the board of the Connectivity Standards Alliance which oversees Matter so it seems likely that its thermostats will be Matter-enabled when the standard is released next year. This should mean that users can control their thermostat with any smart home ecosystem of their choice as long as it is compatible with Matter. But in the meantime T9 owners will be able to keep their toes warm this holiday season with just a few words to their Apple voice assistant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2RlYWxzL25vdi02LWJpa2VzLXNjb290ZXJzLXNrYXRlYm9hcmRzLW9uLXNhbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,21 bikes scooters and skateboards on sale at Early Black Friday prices,"Remember when you were a kid and thought that electric bikes and scooters were the coolest things on earth?

It might just mean robots take their jobs instead.Labor shortages and rising wages are pushing U.S. business to invest in automation. A recent Federal Reserve survey of chief financial officers found that at firms with difficulty hiring one-third are implementing or exploring automation to replace workers. In earnings calls over the past month executives from a range of businesses confirmed the trend.Domino’s Pizza Inc. is “putting in place equipment and technology that reduce the amount of labor that is required to produce our dough balls” said Chief Executive Officer Ritch Allison.Mark Coffey a group vice president at Hormel Foods Corp. said the maker of Spam spread and Skippy peanut butter is “ramping up our investments in automation” because of the “tight labor supply.”The mechanizing of mundane tasks has been underway for generations. It’s made remarkable progress in the past decade: The number of industrial robots installed in the world’s factories more than doubled in that time to about 3 million. Automation has been spreading into service businesses too.The U.S. has lagged behind other economies especially Asian ones but the pandemic might trigger some catching up. With some 10.4 million open positions as of August and record numbers of Americans quitting their jobs the difficulty of finding staff is adding new incentives.Ametek Inc. makes automation equipment for industrial firms like motion trackers that are used from steel and lumber mills to packaging systems. Chief Executive Officer David A. Zapico says that part of the company is “firing on all cylinders.” That’s because “people want to remove labor from the processes” he said on an earnings call. “In some places you can’t hire labor.”Unions have long seen automation as a threat. At U.S. ports which lag their global peers in technology and are currently at the center of a major supply-chain crisis the International Longshoremen’s Association has vowed to fight it.Companies that say they want to automate “have one goal in mind: to eliminate your job and put more money in their pockets” ILA President Harold Daggett said in a video message to a June conference. “We’re going to fight this for 100 years.”Some economists have warned that automation could make America ’s income and wealth gaps worse.“If it continues labor demand will grow slowly inequality will increase and the prospects for many low-education workers will not be very good” says Daron Acemoglu a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who testified Wednesday at a Senate hearing on the issue.That’s not an inevitable outcome Acemoglu says: Scientific knowhow could be used “to develop technologies that are more complementary to workers.” But with research largely dominated by a handful of giant firms that spend the most money on it “this is not the direction the technology is going currently.”Knightscope makes security robots that look a bit like R2-D2 from Star Wars and can patrol sites such as factory perimeters. The company says it’s attracting new clients who are having trouble hiring workers to keep watch. Its robots cost from $3.50 to $7.50 an hour according to Chief Client Officer Stacy Stephens and can be installed a month after signing a contract.One new customer is the Los Angeles International Airport one of the busiest in the U.S. Soon Knightscope robots will be monitoring some of its parking lots.They are “supplementing what we have in place and are not replacing any human services” said Heath Montgomery the airport’s director of public relations. “It’s another way we are providing exceptional guest experiences.”,,,,,,,,,,,,

Find out more about how we test .

Remember the days when you couldn’t put magnets near your computer or else you would risk frying it for good? These days having cases that magnetically attach to phones and tablets is commonplace and in the case of the HP Chromebook x2 11 both the case and the keyboard utilize strong magnets for a clean seamless design.

And that’s not the only modern design HP has brought into their new Plus Chromebook. The addition of a beautiful 2K display in a 3:2 ratio means scrolling through media feeds is a breeze and the efficient Qualcomm 7C processor delivers good battery life.

Once you add the magnetic stylus that charges wirelessly into the mix you get a design that truly draws you in.

HP Chromebook x2 price and configuration

There are only a few configuration options available for the HP Chromebook x2 two at HP and one at Best Buy. The standard option is a Night Teal built with a Qualcomm SnapDragon 7C processor 4GB RAM 4GB eMMC and LTE capabilities for $569 . For an additional $90  you can upgrade to 8GB RAM and 128GB eMMC in the Shade Grey color. Be aware however that neither configuration from HP has the stylus included.

Best Buy’s only configuration is a bit different from the other two. You still get the same processor but with a combo of 8GB RAM and 64GB eMMC. Plus it offers these in either color instead of limiting the configurations to specific ones. And while LTE isn’t an option here you do get the stylus included. All this runs for $599 . And if you’re concerned about the lack of storage this configuration offers the SIM card slot can also be used as a microSD card reader for a little extra space.

HP Chromebook x2 design

HP really knocked it out of the park with the Chromebook x2. There are so many little details that when brought together make for a stylish device that you could easily show off to others. At only 9.9 x 4.6 x 0.3 inches it’s also portable but a bit too thick to use comfortably with one hand in tablet mode. The Chromebook itself is light at just 2.56 pounds yet it feels durable thanks to its aluminum unibody design.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Without the keyboard or kickstand case attached it looks like a standard tablet with only the webcam on the top HP logo and Chromebook logo in the middle interrupting the smooth aluminum casing. Once you pop on the magnetic casing you won’t be seeing much of the metal design. Both the back casing and the keyboard easily and securely snap onto the device with the help of magnets and both are made of a polyurethane-coated material with a nice textured feel. The back of the case is divided in half lengthwise and is designed so the bottom half folds out creating a quick and easy kickstand. The hinge is surprisingly steady and even holds up well to the pressure of taking notes or sketching.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Surrounded by half-inch bezels the 11-inch screen is the main feature on the front. But hidden in these bezels are a pair of speakers -- one on each side of the display -- and a webcam at the top. On the left edge of the Chromebook are the ports along with the volume rocker while the lock button/fingerprint scanner makes its home on the top edge. On the right edge is a spot to dock and charge the stylus and the bottom edge houses the pins for attaching and connecting the keyboard.

HP Chromebook x2 ports

The compact design of the HP Chromebook x2 doesn’t allow for many ports but the two USB 3.0 Type-C inputs on the left side let you charge the tablet while connected to a USB hub. The lack of a headphone jack is disappointing but it does still offer Bluetooth connectivity for those who need it.

HP Chromebook x2 display

“Perfect for entertainment” is how HP has been advertising the HP Chromebook x2 and with its 11-inch 2K 3:2 display the company is not exaggerating.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Aside from the thick-ish bezels I couldn’t find anything to complain about when it came to watching the Venom 2: Let There be Carnage trailer; the image was crisp enough to be able to read some of the product packaging in the cooking scene and you could still see the expression of dejected acceptance on Eddie’s face as he sat while the camera zoomed out showing a wide view of his apartment. Later in the trailer an aerial view over the city at night shows amazing detail without losing quality due to the lack of lighting. And I noticed the reds and greens amid the blue lighting in the scene with Carnage in front of the stained glass window.

Our colorimeter disputed my findings measuring only 71% of the DCI-P3 scale which is lower than the Pixelbook Go (76.7) and far below the laptop average (80.5). But boy can this screen get bright. We found that it could reach 25 nits past the advertised 400 nits. Not only does this knock the Asus Chromebook Flip C434 (286 nits) out of the ballpark it even beats the average laptop’s (360 nits) brightness.

The touchscreen is pleasantly responsive. It scrolls swipes and zooms with ease. However the on-screen keyboard is a pain to use. When typing normally there's a short delay between hitting the desired key and having it register on the screen. Thankfully you can slide (or swipe?) your finger across the digital keyboard to spell words and this reacts much quicker. Just don’t expect the computer to automatically add spaces between words when you type this way.

HP Chromebook x2 audio

HP has made it a habit recently to feature premium audio in their devices making sure to advertise that their speakers are produced by Bang and Olufsen. On the HP Chromebook x2 these speakers are inlaid in the bezels of the screen. They blend in flawlessly so they’re hard to see but easy to hear. And while the volume didn’t quite knock my socks off the quality of the audio at any volume was good.

While listening to ""Rosanna"" by Toto I could distinguish each instrument as well as each vocal harmony. The higher notes of the trumpets never sounded too brassy or tinny and the guitar and drums didn't have that crinkly rattle sound that cheaper speakers tend to struggle with. And in the trailer to the new Disney movie Encanto the upbeat music was never garbled or static-y. The speakers retained the integrity of the music without garbling what the characters were saying.

Try not to set your expectations too high on the bass of these speakers. While the intro for ""Seven Nation Army"" by The White Stripes sounded fine the familiar bass-line was weak even at full volume and was drowned out by the drums and vocals.

HP Chromebook x2 keyboard and touchpad

I was surprised by how durable the keyboard felt despite being lightweight. Sure there’s some give while typing thanks to the flexible nature of the plastic keyboard but it didn’t feel at risk of collapsing though the subtle bouncing combined with the lack of texture on the keys sometimes made me feel like I was playing a balancing game when typing on my lap.

More than anything the layout of the 11-inch keyboard took some getting used to. In order to fit all the keys comfortably on the device without shrinking them HP had to compromise the backspace enter and right shift buttons. The shift and enter buttons weren’t too hard to adjust to but the backspace ended up nearly the same size as the standard keys; as a result I ended up throwing in a few equals signs while trying to correct mistakes. I was able to swing 60 words per minute on 10FastFingers which is pretty average however my accuracy tanked from 92% to 81%.

Now the touchpad was a pleasant surprise. Typically smaller detachable keyboards have touchpads that scale such as the 2.8 x 1.9-inched touchpad of the similarly sized Asus Chromebook CM3 however the HP Chromebook x2 11’s touchpad is a generous 4.5 x 2.5-inches. It also happens to be the same size as the one on the HP Elitebook Aero G8. This gave me plenty of room to navigate smoothly without having to lift my hand. Plus clicking was smooth and responsive no matter where you tapped or pressed.

HP Chromebook x2 stylus

Any time I see a stylus with pressure sensitivity I get excited. I had high hopes for the USI Pen included as an option for the HP Chromebook x2. It’s light without feeling hollow and is really well balanced. The flat side of the Natural Silver pen magnetically attaches to the right side of the screen securely but also adds that variance in shape that makes the stylus easier to grip. The tip is a darker grey and also has a rougher texture to simulate writing on paper.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

I tested it out in the included note-taking software Cursive. For those who like jotting down quick notes the pen plus Cursive works great. Low latency means no lines dragging behind as you write but this particular app doesn’t support pressure sensitivity so while notes end up clean with even lines they lack a bit of personality. The Chrome Canvas app was a bit better though it never registered lighter strokes so there were constantly gaps while sketching. However there seems to be an issue with palm rejection. I constantly was having to erase little dots and lines produced by my hand resting against the screen while using the pen.

After discovering that the USI pen has 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity I downloaded Huion Sketch just to see if it was the apps limiting the pen’s capabilities. And lo and behold the little pen held strong! There was a good amount of line variance based on how hard or light I pressed. It still couldn’t catch my lightest strokes but had a good feeling nonetheless.

HP Chromebook x2 performance

I never expect much from Chromebooks especially when they sport a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and a 64GB eMMC instead of the speedier SSD options. Now don’t get me wrong the Qualcomm SnapDragon 7C has its advantages. One of them is the low power consumption contributing to the HP Chromebook x2’s energy efficiency. But the performance is lackluster.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

I opened 25 Google Chrome tabs threw some 1080p videos in a few of them and continued typing in Google docs. And while a few tabs took a second or two to think before loading I was able to type without hiccup or lag. After adding five more tabs and one more video I took to a drawing app and found that the previous high-latency pen was having some trouble keeping up with my strokes.

And in the more synthetic performance tests the HP Chromebook x2 scored 1691 in the Geekbench 5 overall performance. That is a poor score for a $600 laptop. Sure it beat the Google Pixelbook Go (1356) but the Chromebook average (2590) leaves me wanting a bit more.

Proving itself to be a device more for media consumption once more the HP Chromebook x2 scored a 63 in the Jetstream 2 benchmark which measures web-browsing performance. It's a nice upgrade compared to the similarly designed Asus Chromebook Detachable (33.2) but the Chromebook average (101.1) leaves you wanting.

HP Chromebook x2 battery life

HP’s benchmarks found that their Chromebook x2 had an average battery life of 10 hours.

We put that to the test with the grueling task of continuous web browsing over WiFi at a brightness of 150 nits and the results showed that it lasted 11 hours and 4 minutes! While not class-leading the Lenovo Chromebook Duet can last 12:46 it held strong against the Asus Chromebook Flip C434 (9:58).

HP Chromebook x2 webcam

There are two cameras on the HP Chromebook x2 an 8MP rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing camera.

What’s nice about the rear-facing camera is that it can also be used as a portable scanner for documents. As for image quality these are fine. The front-facing camera was a bit grainy but had good contrast and color and the rear-facing camera had similar results. No stunning images are going to be captured by this device but most Chromebooks are going to have similar webcams. If you need higher-quality calls an external webcam may just supplement your experience.

HP Chromebook x2 software and warranty

Being a Chromebook the HP Chromebook runs Chrome OS. It comes pre-installed with most of the standard apps including the Google Suite YouTube and the Google Play Store. It also comes installed with Cursive a note-taking app; Stadia Google’s gaming platform subscription service; and Chrome Canvas a drawing app that offers layers and pressure-sensitive sketching.

The HP Chromebook x2 comes with a one-year warranty.

Verdict

Entertainment is the HP Chromebook x2’s bread and butter. Rich speakers and a bright 11-inch 2K display offer quality experiences for both music listening and video viewing.

But for a device made with students in mind the HP Chromebook x2 offers a lackluster working experience. Web browsing may be smooth and snappy but other apps don’t have quite the same speed or performance. Also the detachable keyboard makes for a nice addition but it’s hard to keep your grip without it which made me hesitant to use it as a tablet instead.

If performance is what attracts you it might be worth your while to check out the $749 Asus Chromebook Cx9.

Tras la aglomeración 23 personas fueron trasladadas al hospital y otras 11 que fueron llevadas en ambulancia estaban en paro cardíaco según comunicaron las autoridades de Houston. Más de 300 personas fueron atendidas a lo largo del evento el viernes en un hospital de campaña en el lugar como reporta NBC News.

Alrededor de 50000 personas asistieron al evento que comenzó el viernes en el NRG Park y que fue organizado por el rapero y productor Travis Scott. Se esperaba que el festival que está en su tercer año fuera un evento de dos días pero las autoridades dijeron que las presentaciones del sábado habían sido canceladas.

Alrededor de las 9:15 pm “la multitud comenzó a comprimirse hacia la parte delantera del escenario” según explicó el jefe de bomberos Samuel Peña en una conferencia de prensa a primera hora del sábado. Agregó que aún no se conoce la causa de la muerte de las ocho víctimas pero que se determinará.

“Eso causó algo de pánico y empezó a provocar algunos heridos la gente empezó a caerse a quedar inconsciente y creó un pánico adicional” agregó el jefe de bomberos.

""Fue escalofriante... genuinamente"" dijo una asistente al festival Alleighya Odom de 21 años a NBC News y añadió que la multitud apretada ""era como esta fuerza en mi espalda esta fuerza continua"".

""Empecé a mirar a mi alrededor y había gente en el suelo. Había gente mirándome como asustada con los ojos desorbitados como diciendo 'Por favor ayúdenme'"" dijo. ""Había gente detrás de mí llorando porque los estaban pisando"".

Odom quien ha ido a Astroworld desde 2018 dijo que se ubicó en una zona menos concurrida porque tiene un tobillo roto y temía lesionarlo más.

Agregó que no se había dado cuenta de la gravedad de la situación hasta que vio mensajes angustiados de su madre preguntando si estaba a salvo.

[Mueren ocho personas durante concierto de Travis Scott y así reaccionó el rapero]

“Es una locura” dijo Odom.

Scott había detenido el espectáculo en múltiples ocasiones para pedir ayuda a los fans según la joven.

Otros usuarios en redes sociales dijeron lo mismo sobre el accionar del músico.

""Esta noche nuestros corazones están con la familia del festival Astroworld. Especialmente con aquellos que perdimos y sus seres queridos"" dijeron los organizadores del concierton en un comunicado breve compartido en redes sociales.

Travis Scott también acudió a su cuenta de Twitter para decir que está ""absolutamente devastado"" por lo que ocurrió durante su presentación.

""Estoy comprometido a trabajar con la comunidad de Houston para sanar y apoyar a las familias necesitadas"" dijo.

Una situación que escaló rápidamente

El teniente Larry Satterwhite subjefe de la policía de Houston que estaba cerca del lugar del suceso explicó que la situación se desarrolló rápidamente.

“Parece que ocurrió en el transcurso de unos pocos minutos: de repente teníamos a varias personas en el suelo experimentando algún tipo de paro cardíaco o algún tipo de episodio médico. Inmediatamente empezamos a hacer la reanimación cardiopulmonar” contó.

En una conferencia de prensa más tarde Troy Finner jefe de la policía de Houston dijo que había ""muchos rumores circulando"" sobre el incidente incluyendo uno ""de gente que se inyectaba drogas"".

Instando a la gente a no especular dijo que la policía estaba decidida a ""asegurarse"" de averiguar lo que pasó y agregó que Scott y los organizadores del festival estaban cooperando con la policía.

Más temprano en el día múltiples personas resultaron heridas cuando los asistentes al festival se apresuraron a una entrada frontal según informó la cadena local de noticias KPRC de Houston afiliada de nuestra cadena hermana NBC News.

“En cuanto la gente empezó a entrar pensé: ‘Oh no... esto va a ser una locura’” dijo. “La forma en la que la gente entraba era realmente violenta. Estaban arrancando las pulseras de la gente en la fila” agregó.

El jefe de la policía de Houston dijo que las muertes y lesiones no estaban relacionadas con esa entrada apresurada ya que la aglomeración en el concierto se produjo mucho más tarde.

Las autoridades se pronuncian sobre la tragedia

El gobernador de Texas Greg Abbott compartió un comunicado en la red social Twitter en el que calificó lo ocurrido como ""trágico"".

""Nuestros corazones están con aquellos que perdieron sus vidas y aquellos que resultaron heridos en esta aterradora oleada de gente"" dijo.

Agregó que ordenó al Departamento de Seguridad Pública de Texas que habiliten recursos para apoyar la investigación.

Por su parte la jueza del condado de Harris Lina Hidalgo dijo: “Nuestros corazones están rotos”. Y agregó: “La gente va a estos eventos en busca de un buen momento una oportunidad para relajarse y para generar buenos recuerdos”.

Según las autoridades en el lugar se estableció un centro de reunificación para cualquier persona que tenga amigos o familiares que asisitieron al concierto y que no hayan tenido noticias de ellos.

QUÉ PUDO CAUSAR LA TRAGEDIA

Los funcionarios de la ciudad de Texas dijeron el sábado que estaban en las primeras etapas de la investigación del pandemonio que se desarrolló el viernes por la noche en Astroworld un evento de dos días con entradas agotadas en el NRG Park con una asistencia estimada de 50000 personas.

Los fallecidos tenían entre 14 y 27 años y 13 personas seguían hospitalizadas el sábado informó el alcalde Sylvester Turner. Dijo que se trató de “una tragedia en muchos niveles” y que era demasiado pronto para sacar conclusiones sobre lo que salió mal. Decenas de personas resultaron heridas.

“Bien puede ser que esta tragedia sea el resultado de eventos impredecibles de circunstancias que se juntaron y que no podrían haberse evitado” expresó la jueza Lina Hidalgo la principal funcionaria electa del condado Harris. “Pero hasta que determinemos eso haré preguntas difíciles”.

Varios asistentes describieron como ""una locura"" la estampida humana que terminó en la muerte de ocho personas durante el festival Astroworld en Houston.

Expertos en muertes durante multitudes explican que a menudo son el resultado de la densidad: demasiadas personas apiñadas en un espacio pequeño. La multitud a menudo huye en avalancha de una amenaza percibida o hacia algo que quieren como un artista antes de chocar contra una barrera.

Uno de los asistentes narró que cuando el temporizador marcaba el inicio de la actuación de Scott la multitud comenzó a empujar hacia adelante.

“Tan pronto salió al escenario fue como si una energía surgiera y todo se volvió una locura” contó Niaara Goods una de las asistentes al concierto. “De repente te estaban aplastando las costillas. Tenías el brazo de alguien en el cuello. Intentabas respirar pero no podías”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lcy9vY2hvLWZhbGxlY2lkb3MtZW4tYXZhbGFuY2hhLWh1bWFuYS1kdXJhbnRlLWNvbmNpZXJ0by1lbi1ob3VzdG9uL2EtNTk3Mzk3OTfSAWFodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZXMvb2Noby1mYWxsZWNpZG9zLWVuLWF2YWxhbmNoYS1odW1hbmEtZHVyYW50ZS1jb25jaWVydG8tZW4taG91c3Rvbi9hLTU5NzM5Nzk3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ocho fallecidos en avalancha humana en concierto en Houston,"En el festival de música Astroworld con unos 50.000 espectadores y en el que actuaba el rapero Travis Scott en ese momento vivió escenas de pánico.

Al menos ocho personas murieron y varias resultaron heridas la noche del viernes (05.11.2021) en el festival de música Astroworld en Houston (sur de Estados Unidos) debido a una avalancha humana informaron las autoridades y los medios estadounidenses. El evento se celebraba en el Parque NRG donde se construyó un hospital de campaña improvisado.

""Tenemos ocho personas fallecidas esta noche y varios individuos más heridos"" dijo el responsable de los bomberos de Houston Samuel Peña. Su departamento explicó a través de Twitter que se ha establecido un punto de encuentro para familiares de los heridos en un hotel cercano.

El incidente cuyas circunstancias todavía no han sido completamente aclaradas sucedió pasadas las nueve de la noche hora local mientras el rapero Travis Scott hacía su actuación. ""La multitud empezó a empujar hacia el frente del escenario creando pánico y los primeros heridos (…). La gente empezó a caerse a quedar inconsciente y eso aumentó el pánico"" añadió.

Los servicios de rescate transportaron a 17 personas al hospital incluidos 11 en paro cardíaco explicó Peña. El jefe de los bomberos añadió que en el festival de música participaban unos 50.000 espectadores como se puede apreciar en los últimos tuits de la cuenta oficial del festival. Los organizadores detuvieron el concierto cuando fue evidente que varias personas habían resultaron heridas explicó por su parte el jefe de la policía de Houston Troy Finner.

The service formerly was provided to the county seat by TCF Bank which merged with Huntington this past summer.

“I think the treatment of the City of Mount Clemens by TCF/Huntington has been extremely unprofessional” Voorhess said at a commission meeting earlier this month.

The public criticism was the latest salvo fired by Mount Clemens leaders who say the bank merger has created a “slew of problems” for city departments.

Asked for a response by The Macomb Daily Huntington personnel said they are reviewing the situation.

“We are aware of the city’s frustration and are working with them on this and the overall transition to Huntington National Bank” spokesperson Randi Berris said in an email.

The issue came up during the Nov. 1 commission meeting as the administration reported ongoing difficulties with Huntington.

Commissioners found out a department head was on the phone for four hours with a call center trying to hammer out the coin situation a move Voorhess labeled as “totally inappropriate.”

Voorhess who retired after a 25-year career with the former First National Bank of Mount Clemens pointed out Mount Clemens represents a $25 million annual account to TCF/Huntington. He said the merger is proving that “bigger is not better” in some cases.

“When I was in the banking business we would give our eye teeth to have a $25 million account deposit at your branch” he said.

According to City Manager Don Johnson the city’s Finance Department was advised by Huntington to contract with an armored car service to pick up coins at City Hall count wrap and deposit the money into the city’s account.

The proposed process would take two to three days before the city accounts would be credited and could cost Mount Clemens as much as $5000 a year in additional service fees.

Instead the administration has arranged for Comerica Bank to process the coin deposits. City personnel

will deliver the coin bags to the Comerica Bank on Harrington Street and Groesbeck Highway and the bank will process the deposit within 36 hours. The city will transfer funds to Huntington prior to

the end of the month.

Johnson has said the city is actively looking at moving its banking elsewhere but so far hasn’t found much luck.

Mayor Laura Kropp also mentioned a thread on social media criticizing the city for not supporting a “local” business in Huntington due to a recent Macomb Daily article outlining Mount Clemens’ frustrations with the bank.

According to the bank’s website Columbus Ohio-based Huntington has 920 branches in seven Midwest states.

“Huntington is not a local business by any means” the mayor said. “It’s a very large company and we are a small insignificant piece to them.”

City boosters are still upset Huntington in November 2013 closed the branch on Main Street at Cass Avenue a prime intersection in the city right across the street from the Macomb County administration offices. At the time the bank said the closure was part of an effort to streamline operations noting Huntington was retaining another branch on Gratiot Avenue in Mount Clemens.

City officials said the move provided an opportunity for other companies to locate in a key spot but the building remains vacant some eight years later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rYXJlMTEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9rYXJlMTEtc2F0dXJkYXkvY2x1Yi1jYW1icmlhLW9mZmVycy1mYW5zLXByZW1pdW0tZ2FtZS1kYXktZXhwZXJpZW5jZS84OS05ZTUyM2IzMy03NTM5LTQxMWUtODNkYy0zNjU2MzgwNjFjMzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Club Cambria offers Gophers fans premium game day experience,"MINNEAPOLIS — A new lounge at Huntington Bank Stadium offers an elite game day experience even for the most casual of Minnesota Gophers fans.

Some time in October 2020 I decided it was time for me to begin a data science career. I have an economics background and taught myself coding during my Master’s thesis so I had absolutely no idea how to approach this field. After reading a bunch of Medium articles and other blog posts on how other people think one should kickstart his career in data science I ended up enrolling into IBM’s Data Science Professional Certificate. After a year of learning ranting and joy I ended my one year love-hate relationship with the course and got my certificate. This is my very subjective review of the course and why I would do it all over again — may it help you make a better informed decision!

Why did I choose this course?

Good question! There are tons of other courses like Harvard’s course for data science or John Hopkins program. Just browse Medium for “Data Science Course” and you will get thousands of articles about which course is the best for what. In the end they all tell you the same things: You gotta start somewhere and it will not be the last course you take. I decided to go for the IBM course because of two reasons:

I wanted the brand. At the time of writing IBM is on place 42 of the Fotune 500 companies. Most people on earth have heard of them and have a general idea of what they are doing. Having a certificate from IBM will make explanations with HR departments easier.

I read this article by Jeff Hale that featured an analysis of the most wanted skills for data scientists in the job market in 2019. It stated that Python and related libraries as well as SQL gain popularity while programming languages like R loose in demand. As the IBM certificate is primarily based on Python and SQL it was a natural fit for me.

How was the course structured?

When I started the course it was consisting out of 9 different modules. Something like two month down the road a pop up window appeared asking me if I would like to upgrade to the updated version of the course which has the following 10 modules:

Module 1: What is Data Science?

Well what can I say. It is a standard introduction course that does its job perfectly: It gives you a broad overview of the subject matter and helps to get rid of some initial question marks. My major takeaway was the distinguished definition of who a data scientist actually is. It also introduced me to this book about data science which I highly recommend reading.

Module 2: Tools for Data Science

For anyone who is a total beginner to this space like me — this one will blow your mind. The module bombards you with tools that you can use for all the different kinds of use cases you might come across in your data science career. It is not necessary you memorize them all but it is a great place to go back to in case you face a new challenge.

Module 3: Data Science Methodology

You will learn how to structure your work. Sounds boring because you finally want to code? Yeah… sounds familiar but trust me — you don’t want to miss it. When you analyze and code larger projects you will get lost easily. Knowing somewhat of framework to stick to is key to achieve your objective.

Module 4: Python for Data Science AI & Development

The title is more promising than the actual material. You will learn Python basics and how to handle standard data types. That is it no fancy AI no development experience just some more theory and simple coding.

Module 5: Python project for Data Science

Finally something to do! In this project you will apply the learned basics in a somewhat real-life scenario. I would say it is doable for everyone and gives you some confidence in your new skills — great module fun to do!

Module 6: Database and SQL for Data Science with Python

You never used SQL? Then this course is perfect for you. It provides a great introduction into the theory and will get you a lot of coding exposure.

Module 7: Data Analysis with Python

This module will feel like you go from 0 to 100. It teaches you data wrangling data analysis and model creation. If you have never done this before you might feel overwhelmed as module 5 and 6 are not preparing you for this. Take your time understand line by line visual by visual and digest it. You will need it later.

Module 8: Data Visualization with Python

Nothing is better than visualizing your data. It helps you to understand it and this module will teach you how to do it. I am not going to lie — I hate data visualization with Python. It takes forever but the insights you gain are priceless so better listen carefully.

Module 9: Machine learning with Python

Another fancy title that sounds more promising than it is. This module will give you an introduction into the most common and basic machine learning approaches you can do with Python. Don’t expect this to take you down the rabbit hole. However I think it is a great introduction to the matter if you have no prior experience.

Module 10: Applied Data Science Capstone

Now this was by far my most favorite module. You get to apply all your learned skills at one large project. First they show you how to do it then you have to replicate it. How difficult you make it for yourself is your own decision. You can either simply copy and paste the module’s code and apply it in a slightly different way or you can come up with somethin unique. Both ways will get you what you want: The final certificate. If you are interested how I did it feel free to read my article about my capstone project.

How much time did it take me?

I work full time in an investment firm and I try as much as I can to spend my free time with my fiance and our two dogs. This kind of routine does not allow much time to watch hours of learning material read documentation and spend hours to develop my code. So I ended up scheduling my day more efficiently. As a result I made time to spend one or two hours every day on the course. I did that by majorly waking up earlier every morning. Sometimes my worked interfered and I had to break with my schedule but in the end I managed to complete all modules within 11 months.

Is that how much it is going to take you? That depends. It depends on how much you already know how many commitments you have and how difficult your capstone project will be. I spend probably three month on mine. Judging from the other capstone projects I have reviewed most people spend two or three weeks on their projects. Also a lot of people who take the course are students and have much more free time than people who work. So if you have some experience with Python have a lot of free time and tend to solve things the easy way you will probably not need longer than 3 month to finish the entire certificate.

How much did it cost?

The subscription for the course cost me 39 US dollars per month. The quicker you are the cheaper it gets. However I found it extremely cheap compared to other courses or a university degree. Plus in Germany you can deduct the course from tax. So the final costs are even lower.

What is my final opinion?

Above I wrote about a love-hate relationship. I hated this course because I had to get up so early in the mornings. I didn’t like that you had to watch/read through so much theory before you finally reached the coding part. I hated that your assignments are graded by other people who often obviously do not take the time to read your documentation and in result grade you worse.

I loved the course because I had to develop a routine that made me more efficient. I later appreciated the fact that I had to watch hours of theory as it saved me more than once. And I found it extremely interesting to read the work of other people while grading them.

Every medal has two sides. Will this course make you a data scientist? No it won’t. But it will provide you with a solid understanding of the subject matter and kickstart your career. When you complete this course you are ready to dive into more complex topics and gain more skill.

Would I do it again?

Absolutely yes. In fact I just started another IBM course for data engineering. I started to like my early morning routine and found myself missing some knowledge about how to build ETL pipelines from scratch. My objective is to get this certificate done under 12 month and gain the skills to build myself some useful tools. So… challenge accepted! ;-)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL3RvcC10ZWNoLWNvbXBhbmllcy13b3JraW5nLW9uLWF1Z21lbnRlZC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtaW4tMjAyMdIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FtcC9zdG9yeS9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy90b3AtdGVjaC1jb21wYW5pZXMtd29ya2luZy1vbi1hdWdtZW50ZWQtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWluLTIwMjE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Tech Companies Working on Augmented Intelligence in 2021,IBM is one of the top tech companies that is working on augmented intelligence to improve lives and give hope through artificial intelligence.

In April 2015 researchers from the University of Birmingham in the UK arrived in Guinea during the Ebola outbreak with nothing but a few suitcases. In one was a mobile phone-sized device that would change the course of the epidemic — a portable DNA sequencer called the MinION.

The device along with laptops and accessories enabled the researchers to set up a self-contained laboratory. Instantly they could examine the evolving virus and its variants and help shape the development of a novel vaccine.

The sequencer was made by a small UK company called Oxford Nanopore Technologies which was spun out of the University of Oxford in 2005. In September 2021 in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic the company floated on the London Stock Exchange achieving a market capitalisation of £3.5bn which made it the third-largest biotechnology listing globally this year.

“Genome-sequencing information is crucial for researchers and epidemiologists during an epidemic” Nick Loman the University of Birmingham professor who led the Ebola team wrote in a report after the epidemic. “Yet generating such information is a laborious process typically performed in well-equipped laboratories using large delicate and expensive hardware.”

In Guinea the Birmingham team discovered that the MinION took less than an hour to sequence a sample of the Ebola virus meaning they could analyse specimens and produce usable information within 24 hours.

Months later the team travelled to Brazil to study the spread of the Zika virus using the same sequencers helping in the public health management of the outbreak. Nanopore sequencing had turned genomic sequencing into a real-time decentralised community effort that could save lives. So when the Covid-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic last year the Oxford-based company’s patented technology proved indispensable. The devices were essential in identifying and tracking the spread of Covid variants in 85 countries and have sequenced about 18 per cent of all coronavirus genomes globally.

“Oxford Nanopore is a frontrunner in the next generation of sequencing technologies” says Julian Roberts an equities analyst at Jefferies. “The last year changed Nanopore’s revenues completely. One contract alone from the UK government was £115m which was more than the company’s entire revenue for the previous year. The pandemic really put it on the map.”

Oxford Nanopore made a gross profit of £26.9m in the first half of 2021 with a gross margin of 51 per cent the company says. Revenues rose 22 per cent to £59m in the six months to June compared with the same period last year.

The $7bn market for DNA sequencing has so far been dominated by Illumina of the US. The company which has a market cap of $60bn entered the market by buying a UK start-up called Solexa in 2007. Devices such as Illumina’s can take days to produce sequencing information and are the size of a large filing cabinet and therefore not portable. Nanopore’s devices which are approaching Illumina’s for accuracy are cheaper quicker and have been used everywhere from country hospitals to city streets farms and oceans.

“I would have never imagined that a few years after it helped track the Ebola and Zika viruses we would be doing the same thing in the UK” says Matt Loose a developmental biologist at the University of Nottingham who led the Nottingham chapter of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK). “The pandemic was an exceptional event but we were able to start sequencing Sars-Cov-2 within a couple of weeks of patients appearing in Nottinghamshire hospitals. We took things developed in the field in west Africa and adapted them and scaled them up for use in the UK.”

Oxford Nanopore’s patented technology allows scientists to sequence DNA by creating pores in a synthetic material that are just small enough for a single DNA molecule to be passed through and identified by measuring changes in the electrical current.

During the pandemic COG-UK teams such as Loose’s used it to analyse the genomes of coronavirus samples in communities and sent the information to local hospitals. They also sent it centrally to Public Health England and other organisations that were analysing the data at scale looking at the spread of variants for instance.

“A group of people met early on and said we need to be running genetic epidemiology of this virus and understanding what is happening globally and the UK was world-leading” Loose says. “The impact of that has been that we were able to use nanopore sequencing to follow the variants see how the virus is changing and measure and understand its spread.”

Loose’s team of eight scientists received daily samples from patients in Nottinghamshire hospitals and were able to track hospital-acquired transmissions and identify the Delta variant early on from people who had recently returned from India or Bangladesh.

“We hadn’t even heard about epidemiological surveillance until Covid-19 and Oxford Nanopore was at the forefront of feeding into our understanding of how the virus evolved and where it was becoming more present and dangerous” says Julia Hawkins a general partner at early-stage investment firms LocalGlobe and Latitude which invested in Oxford Nanopore in 2019. “Epidemiological surveillance is here to stay. This is something countries everywhere working with scientists will be adopting as a matter of course in future.

MinION sequencers offer portability and fast results

“The life sciences tools market is made up of more than 1m life scientists and over 100000 labs globally. This provides a great foundation for both near- and medium-term growth for Oxford Nanopore.”

The company’s core customers are universities and laboratories conducting scientific research but it hopes the Covid-19 bump it experienced will help the industry move towards applied genomics or a “global Internet of Living Things” — real-time networks of biological sensors that can be used in hospitals pharmaceuticals food and water safety and agriculture — which it says could be valued in the tens of billions of pounds.

“Covid-19 is changing how broader communities think about infectious disease. With the spectre of microbial resistance approaching governments are now more aware of the health and economic threat of pathogens and taking pathogen surveillance much more seriously” says Gordon Sanghera Oxford Nanopore chief executive. “The challenge isn’t just understanding pathogens in humans; to have real visibility epidemiologists would like to build pathogen surveillance in animals and even waste water environments.”

An example of the move from lab to clinic is the UK government-funded project by Genomics England which is testing whether NHS hospitals can conduct accurate real-time sequencing tests for cancer diagnostics. The project which uses Oxford Nanopore sequencers has already been piloted for about 12 months and Genomics England hopes it will be able to roll it out nationally in the coming year.

“Cancer patients need to have very fast diagnostic turnround times because they have to be treated quickly” says Parker Moss chief commercial officer at Genomics England. “This means the sequencers can be in the hospitals closer to the patients and we don’t have to motorbike it into a national sequencing lab which is currently in Cambridge.”

He adds that the nanopore method is also able to read areas of the genome that are difficult to do so with “gold-standard” traditional sequencers such as Illumina’s. So it could identify new areas in the genome for drugs to bind to giving “new therapeutic options for patients”.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Of late the company has been unable to keep up with the pace of change that co-founder Gordon Moore forecast for the technology industry.

Moore's Law predicted that the density of transistors able to fit on a chip would double approximately every two years.

""Intel was the Moore's Law company and the undisputed leader"" said Christopher Rolland an analyst at Susquehanna. ""And something that was supposed to take them two years instead took them more than five. And they still struggle to get back on Moore's Law today.""

While Intel's newly released Alder Lake CPUs are packed with competitive features its chip technology is behind that of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung . Fifty years after Intel debuted the 4004 the world's first CPU it's been hindered by several production delays.

""We had some missteps"" said Pat Gelsinger who took over as Intel's CEO in February. ""The strategy had become a little bit confused on the role that we're going to play in manufacturing for the long term. And now we're leaning back into that with clarity with clear urgency.""

Gelsinger has an ambitious roadmap to catch and surpass Samsung and TSMC by 2025. Key to the plan is a series of massive new chip fabrication plants or fabs that Intel is building in the U.S. Europe and Israel. Combined they will cost more than $44 billion to build.

""I think I have more concrete trucks working for me today than any other human on the planet"" Gelsinger said. ""We have construction in Oregon New Mexico Arizona Ireland and Israel. And we expect to plant our next major fabs in the U.S. and Europe before the end of this year.""

Doubling down on manufacturing is one of the major moves Gelsinger has made since taking the helm. He also recently announced Intel Foundry Services a business that opens up Intel's fabs to make chips designed by Amazon  Qualcomm and other customers. For decades the markets have rewarded giants like Apple and Qualcomm for being fabless. But the chip shortage has made manufacturing chips a more attractive business allowing TSMC for example to raise chip prices as much as 20%.

""It takes time to build this infrastructure"" said Keyvan Esfarjani Intel's senior vice president of manufacturing supply chain and operations. ""But the good news is the world is rallying behind building additional capacity.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjd29ybGQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvNTQ4OTk5LzEydGgtZ2VuLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrLXJldmlldy1pbnRlbC1pcy1iYWNrLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-12900K review: Intel.

Everyone likes redemption stories and Intel’s 12th gen Core i9-12900K is a comeback story for the ages. The once mighty and complacent champ was defeated years ago forced through one humiliating loss after another at the hands of AMD’s resurgent Ryzen processors until finally somehow finding a way back to fighting form and claiming victory once again. Fade to black and cue credits.

Life (and technology) never has that Hollywood ending but Intel’s Core i9-12900K gets pretty damned close. After years of being pummeled by AMD processors the 12900K’s performance makes it the far better CPU for most people than its bitter rival the Ryzen 9 5950X. No it’s not a knock-out victory by any means but considering where it excels and the features it packs Intel’s 12th-gen “Alder Lake” processor is the CPU to buy today if you’re in the market for a high-end desktop processor.

What is 12th-gen Alder Lake?

You’ll want to read our coverage of Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake reveal for the full nitty-gritty details of the radical new architecture but it’s essentially a hybrid CPU design built on the Intel 7 process. That alone is a huge deal; after spending over half a decade mired on 14nm transistor technology Alder Lake finally leaps up a node. (Intel 7 used to be called 10nm before a rebrand.) It mixes newly designed high-performance CPU cores with smaller more efficient cores to achieve an optimal balance of performance-to-power ratios. Ever since rumors of Alder Lake first leaked people (including ourselves) have wondered just what Intel was thinking by mixing its long-anticipated upgraded cores with “Atom-like” efficiency cores. But a better way to think of Alder Lake is that it’s Intel’s first “Intel 7” process desktop CPU with a completely redesigned big core and for good measure a bunch of extra efficiency cores that can perform as well as its previous 10th-gen cores thrown in too. 12th-gen Alder Lake also ushers in a new era of features including PCIe 5.0 DDR5 memory and a new LGA1700 socket.

How we tested

For this review we’ll be focusing on the main event dialing in on the performance of Intel’s Core i9-12900K. Our review of the Core i5-12600K will soon follow. With the introduction of Windows 11 and its associated teething issues it’s been a bit of a messy review cycle. In the end though a new patch and drivers that have corrected Ryzen 5000’s issues on the new OS meant we conducted our tests only in Windows 11 today.

While we were testing popular Youtube channel Hardware Unboxed reported that it had run into an issue where AMD’s Windows 11 L3 cache bug returned if a processor swap was conducted with Ryzen. We fortunately didn’t run into it but it felt worth mentioning. And for those who would scream “testing should only be done on Windows 10 for Ryzen!” Hardware Unboxed also noted that Windows 11 performance is generally 5 percent better for Ryzen than Windows 10.

For the AMD Ryzen system we used an MSI MEG X570 Godlike board updated with latest BIOS and 64GB of DDR4/3600 Corsair Dominator dual-rank RAM. AMD’s Precision Boost Overdrive feature was set to auto and we selected the AMP memory overclocking profile.

For the Intel Core system we used an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero board outfitted with 64GB of DDR5/4800 Corsair Dominator dual-rank RAM. As it is DDR5 the RAM is technically quad-channel. The board was set to its default state with the Multi-Core Enhancement feature on auto and the XMP memory profile selected.

Both systems were cooled with Corsair H150i Pro Elite Capellix 360mm coolers with fan profiles manually set to 1800 RPM. LEDs were turned off on both systems during power consumption tests. For storage 1TB PCIe 4.0 Corsair MP600 Core SSDs were used. Both systems were powered with Corsair HX1000 Platinum power supplies.

For graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition cards were used.

CPU rendering performance

We’ll kick this off in an area that Intel rarely likes to talk about: 3D rendering and modeling. Intel’s rationale has long been that so few people actually use these applications on a PC that it’s silly to consider them as a meaningful measurement of performance for people. Many will note that Intel made this pivot away from rendering performance only when eclipsed by AMD’s stellar Ryzen CPUs. With that said we’ll start with Maxon’s Cinebench R23 which is a free test based on the rendering engine used in the company’s Cinema4D application which is also embedded in some Adobe applications.

The newest version adopts a 10-minute throttling test as its default. We’re not fans of it but many reviewers will publish this result. Although we don’t have a Windows 11 result for Intel’s 10th-gen and 11th-gen chips we do know under Windows 10 the 10-core Core i9-10900K scores 14336 while the 8-core Core i9-11900K scores 16264. Both in fact are easily knocked out of the ring by AMD’s 12-core Ryzen 9 5900X which is the 22168 range. It’s why we didn’t even bother to wake up the 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X for that fight since it wasn’t needed.

The eye-opener here though is that big long blue bar for the Core i9-12900K. There’s been a lot said about whether it even made sense for Intel to pursue a hybrid design on Alder Lake but for those who have been pounding the table for the last four years over Cinebench performance the 12900K makes no apologizes by slightly edging AMD’s best and brightest CPU in a benchmark where Ryzen has long held homefield advantage.

Intel is right though. Most PC users don’t run applications that can use every CPU core and thread available so it’s important to look at single-threaded performance using Cinebench too. While multi-core performance in Cinebench may give you an idea of how an all-core video encode or photo export in Lightroom Classic might end up the Cinebench R23 single-threaded performance gets you closer to what you might see in Office or Photoshop runs. Again we don’t have Windows 11 results for the Core i9-10900K or the Core i9-11900K but we can tell you the 10th-gen part pulls down a (relatively) dismal 1325 while the 11th-gen matches Ryzen at 1640.

Intel’s latest performance cores however offer up an impressive as hell 19 percent increase in performance over the Ryzen 9 5950X and embarrass the older 10th-gen chip to the tune of 31 percent. For Mac fans wondering how much the MacBook Pro’s M1 Max beats Alder Lake—it doesn’t. In single-threaded performance which is a fairer way to compare mobile chips with desktop chips the 12th-gen Alder Lake CPU is roughly 20 percent faster than Apple’s newest M1 chips. Sure Intel’s new chips aren’t built for laptops but when Intel’s 12th-gen-based laptops come out the MacBook Pro will have a fight on its hands too.

Moving on from Cinebench R23 our next test is the venerable POV-Ray benchmark that’s as old as the Amiga. The test has obviously been updated over the years but it’s a neat ray tracing technology that creates amazing images from simple text-based files. This leans a little more into the “who actually does this?’ argument that Intel makes but it’s still a useful benchmark comparison of raw CPU performance. Up first is the all-core benchmark between the chips. We again see these two monstrous CPUs battling it to a standstill.

Longer bars indicate better performance. Longer bars indicate better performance. IDG Longer bars indicate better performance. IDG IDG

Like Cinebench POV-Ray also offers a single-threaded mode which we run. The results mostly mirror the performance of Cinebench R23 but the 12th-gen Core i9 advantage is cut down to roughly 14 percent instead of 19 percent. It’s still a rock-solid win for the newest Intel CPU though and again probably a little more important to what most people do on their PC most of the time.

You might be wondering why Intel isn’t plastering the world with its performance lead over Ryzen 5000 in Cinebench. Well first that would pretty much invalidate what Intel has been preaching about using “real world” applications for the last few years and would be blatantly hypocritical. But multi-threaded performance isn’t the total lock for the Core i9-12900K either. For example up next you see the result of using the open source Blender 2.93 to render the Barbershop Interior Benchmark scene. The results are in seconds and we can see the Ryzen 9 5950X has the lead here by finishing the render in 20 percent less time than the 12th-gen Core i9. Some of this may be from the design of the Ryzen chip and Blender itself as well as the particulars of this benchmark scene—but some of it may simply be that 32 threads of all-big-core performance matters too. The Ryzen ultimately has 25 percent more threads to process the render vs. the 12900K’s 24 threads 8 of which come from the smaller higher-efficiency cores without Hyper-Threading.

Up next is the Corona benchmark that like Agent Johnson and Agent Johnson bears no relation to the beer or the virus. Instead it’s an unbiased photorealistic renderer. That doesn’t mean it’s a fair benchmark to chips it just means when it renders a scene it takes no visual shortcuts. We again see the Ryzen 9 chip get some payback on the 12th-gen Core i9 by rendering the scene 21 percent faster. The good news for Intel’s 12900K is that despite being unable to win this battle with the Ryzen 9 it’s still offering a significant performance increase over the previous generation. Again we didn’t have Windows 11-based results handy for the Core i9-11900K but that 11th-gen chip scores 5937670 in Windows 10 which gives the new Core i9-12900K a hefty 48 percent improvement over it.

Longer bars indicate better performance. Longer bars indicate better performance. IDG Longer bars indicate better performance. IDG IDG

Our final 3D rendering test uses Chaosgroup’s V-Ray 5 benchmark which is a professional rendering engine that has garnered enough Emmy and Academy awards that it’s practically on the way to an EGOT. The benchmark features GPU and CPU tests but we’re obviously only interested in the CPU results here. The 32 threads of the Ryzen 9 still put it ahead but the margin closes to 11 percent.

IDG IDG IDG

Compression performance

Moving on from 3D rendering we used the free popular and fast 7-Zip’s internal benchmark to gauge compression performance of the CPUs. The benchmark looks at how many threads a CPU has and spools up multiple iterations of itself during the test. The big winner here is Ryzen to the tune of 24 percent in compression performance and 35 percent in decompression performance when all cores are used.

On the compression side memory latency size of the data cache and translation look ahead buffer performance matters while on the decompression side integer as well as branch misprediction penalties matter according to 7-cpu.com‘s documents. In the end we’d say the multi-threaded performance is fairly academic since using the actual application to decompress or compress files typically relies on a single-thread.

The problem for 12th-gen Core i9 is even there it’s not spectacular either. In fact the 11th-gen Core i9 is slightly faster at 7916 in single-threaded performance under Windows 10. The simple answer is Ryzen 9 maintains the edge in compression performance in 7-zip period. Some of it may come from the memory latency of the nascent DDR5 memory and the fact that 7-Zip doesn’t make use of any special instructions but Ryzen wins here.

Encode performance

Our next test is a CPU encode test where we take the free open-source Handbrake transcoder/encoder and task it with converting the free open-source 4K Tears of Steel video to 1080p resolution using H.265. The Ryzen 9 again comes in first finishing the encode about 6 percent faster. That’s not a a huge victory but first is first.

Shorter bars indicate better performance. Shorter bars indicate better performance. IDG Shorter bars indicate better performance. IDG IDG

Synthetic performance

Our next test shifts from practical compression and encoding to Geekbench 5. The test is a synthetic benchmark made up of 21 separate small “loops” that its developer Primate Labs said are modelled on popular applications in everything from text rendering to HDR to machine language and encryption performance. The benchmark has been the subject of controversy in the past but it is hard to maintain any test today without sniping. It is stupidly popular however and no matter what you think of Geekbench 5 people want to see how a CPU performs on it. After a somewhat back and forth in 3D rendering compressing and encoding we see the Intel Core i9-12900K out pace the Ryzen 9 5950X by about 8 percent.

IDG IDG IDG

Geekbench 5 also reports single-threaded performance which is an easier way to make cross comparisons. You could for example compare the scores from the 16-core 12900K against a 10th-gen Core i5 or even a laptop since the core count advantage and thermal advantage of a desktop is less of a factor in this test. Against just the Ryzen 9 5950X though we see the 12th-gen Core i9 open its lead up by about 11 percent.

IDG IDG IDG

Content creation performance

Moving from synthetic tests to actual applications people use our first test is UL’s new Procyon 2.0. It’s a benchmark that requires you to install Adobe Photoshop (we used 22.5) and Adobe Lightroom Classic (we used version 10.4) on the PC. The test then tasks the computer with a set of scripts to determine performance. It’s about as real as you can get since you’re actually measuring Photoshop and Lightroom Classic performance.

The overall score gives the nod to the Core i9-12900K by 4 percent over the Ryzen 9 59050X. Procyon 2.0 breaks down its results two ways: image retouch and batch exports. In the image retouch it’s basically a tie between the 12th gen Core i9 and Ryzen 9 according to Procyon. In Batch Processing which is mostly Lightroom Classic photo export performance the Core i9 nudges the lead up to 5 percent. That last one surprised us a little because Lightroom Exports tend to lean very much on multi-core performance so we would have expected Ryzen 9 to win there. It didn’t.

With huge sprawling applications like Photshop and Lightoom Classic different actions and filters may actually give you different performance results so in addition to Procyon 2.0 we also run Puget System’s Pugetbench for Photoshop. It’s a free test that the custom workstation PC builder created to help inform its customer recommendations.

Unlike Procyon 2.0 Pugetbench for Photoshop focuses solely on Photoshop performance. While Procyon 2.0 gave the 12th-gen Core i9 a mere 4 percent lead Intel’s newest chip inks a far bigger win in Pugetbench with nearly a 15 percent advantage over the Ryzen 9. Diving into the subscores the benchmark produces we see that 12 percent of that comes from the GPU (yes the same GPU and drivers were used on both) 13.5 percent in general use and 15.1 percent in the filter test. This is a very solid win for the Core i9-12900K no matter how you cut it.

Longer bars indicate better performance. Longer bars indicate better performance. IDG Longer bars indicate better performance. IDG IDG

Pugetbench also includes a benchmark for Lightroom Classic. The result is another clear win for the 12th-gen Core i9 over Ryzen 9 with a score 14 percent faster than AMD’s mighty 5950X. Pugetbench breaks it down by active score (which is how responsive the system is while editing photos in Lightroom Classic) and passive score (which is speed during such actions as file exports). In active performance Pugetbench gives the Core i9-12900K about a 10 percent advantage while the passive score for exports generates a surprising 17 percent advantage. That’s two out of two for Intel in Pugetbench which are very very valuable wins to have.

Longer bars indicate better performance. Longer bars indicate better performance. IDG Longer bars indicate better performance. IDG IDG

Moving on to video editing our first test again reaches for Pugetbench’s Premiere Pro benchmark. Our results below are little different because we’ve added two more entries you didn’t see above. These are for the Intel CPUs with their integrated graphics cores off which limits Premiere’s ability to access the chip’s encode and decode engines. Puget Systems actually recommends that you leave the IGP on for video editing even if you have a fast GPU. We consider the official score to be with the IGP on but Intel also sells CPUs with the integrated graphics cores permanently switched off so just know what you’re buying.

With the IGP on the 12th-gen Core i9 is a monster compared to Ryzen 9 with its overall score nearly 37 percent faster. Much of that comes from the live playback score which gets a huge boost from having the integrated graphics cores. We’re not sure but we suspect Intel’s Quick Sync technology may be responsible for much of this. With the IGP off however it’s far closer but still a 6 percent advantage for the 12900K.

IDG IDG IDG

As we did with the image editors we backstop our Premiere testing by also running Procyon 2.0’s Video Editing module. It also relies on real-world applications and requires that Premiere Pro be installed. Unlike Pugetbench however which looks at performance while actively driving the application Procyon is mainly a measurement of how fast the system will export videos from the timeline with color correction and other effects and transitions applied. For these results we don’t have the CPU’s IGP on but in our testing it didn’t seem to matter either way.

The winner is again the Core i9-12900K which comes in about 14 percent faster than the Ryzen 9 5950X. It’s another solid victory for the 12th-gen Core i9 and frankly one in a very important category. People who drive Photoshop Lightroom Classic and Premiere Pro are probably one of the larger power users groups on a desktop PC besides gamers.

AI performance

Our next category is the fast moving field of AI in image processing. Our first test is something we’ve been playing with for a few generations of CPUs: Topaz Lab’s Gigapixel AI which uses AI to increase the resolution of an image with far more fidelity than simpler algorithms. For this work load we take an 8.2 megapixel image of an F-16 Falcon shot on a DSLR a decade ago and increase its resolution by 6x. We allow the application to download the latest AI models for the upsample. We then time how long it takes to perform the action three times. In the past we’ve seen Intel’s laptop chips lay waste to the competition here—Apple and AMD included. The results here however are a little puzzling to us and hard to parse. Like our previous tests we run it with the IGP switched off but even when switched on the Core i9-12900K is actually a little slower than the results shown below taking 57 seconds.

It doesn’t help that Topaz Labs rolls new versions of Gigapixel roughly every few weeks. Since this is a rapidly iterating technology we don’t feel it would have been right to use an older version either. In the end the Ryzen 9 5950X ends up taking 20 percent less time than the Core i9-12900K to finish the task at hand. That’s really all that matters to anyone who uses it.

Shorter bars indicate better performance. Shorter bars indicate better performance. IDG Shorter bars indicate better performance. IDG IDG

12th gen’s secret feature

That’s not the quite the end of the story though. After our reviewer we learned from Anandtech.com’s Dr. Ian Cutress that AVX512—which Intel reiterated was permanently switched off in Alder Lake—could actually be enabled if you turned off the CPU’s efficiency cores. Advanced Vector eXtensions 512 are 512-bit wide extensions that can be used to accelerate math often associated with AI. It’s one of the pieces under the umbrella of Intel’s DL Boost which we’ve frankly lost track of. As we previously said we were surprised the 12th gen Core i9-12900K lost this race to the Ryzen 9 5950X. After hearing that AVX512 could enabled we wondered if that was behind the Core i9’s loss so we disabled the e-cores on our Asus motherboard and selection the option to enable AVX512 in the UEFI.

The 12th gen CPUs appear to have AVX512 capability if you disable the chip’s e-cores in some motherboards. The 12th gen CPUs appear to have AVX512 capability if you disable the chip’s e-cores in some motherboards. IDG The 12th gen CPUs appear to have AVX512 capability if you disable the chip’s e-cores in some motherboards. IDG IDG

We then reran our Gigapixel AI test and both the Core i5 and Core i9 finished the image resize about 11 to 12 percent faster than with AVX512 disabled. It was enough in fact for the Core i9 to pull dead even with the Ryzen 9. So what does this mean? Obviously things are in flux in the rapidly move scene of AI performance. It’s entirely possible that Intel’s 12th gen chips will pull ahead as the applications are optimized for it. We are also rather confused by the presence of AVX512 after Intel again saying it would not be permanently turned off. One theory Cutress puts forward is that it’s a feature that wasn’t quite fully validated in time for the launch so rather than wait for AVX512 Intel opted to cauterize it to not delay getting its chip in front of consumers.

The thing is it’s not really cauterized as previous features that have been turned off are usually physically cut off. It’s also possible that Intel will leave it as a don’t ask don’t tell feature for adventurous people who may want AVX512 to run at their own risk. Another possibility is that someone at Intel may read yet more coverage of this and immediately reach for the phone to tell board vendors to remove the feature. We don’t know but it is a nice little bonus feature after so much back and forth over it.

IDG IDG IDG

Our next AI test uses Nero’s Score 3.0 benchmark to measure photo tagging performance. That’s essentially the same cool (or creepy) thing your smart phone does where it will automatically tag images for you. The good news is with Nero’s AI Photo Tagger (which is based on the same engine) it’s done on your PC where you maintain control. The application and benchmark are based on Intel’s OpenVINO framework.

Unlike Topaz we see Nero Score’s CPU AI tagging giving Intel’s parts a hefty 45 percent advantage over its Ryzen counterpart. Which number should believe to predict where AI is going to fall? Probably somewhere between them. Intel has poured much money and treasure into OpenVino that makes this advantage real after all. It should be tempered however with the reality that the only thing that matters is application support to make that a reality. And clearly sometimes it’s faster on AMD chips as Topaz showed.

Real world performance

People may fantasize about making a special effects for their indie movie or editing photos from exotic trips but the vast majority of the world is actually more concerned with the boring stuff that pays the bills. For that we have Microsoft Office performance which we measure using UL’s Procyon 2.0 Office Productivity test. Like the Adobe side it’s based on tasking Microsoft Word Excel PointPoint and Outlook with fairly advanced and media-rich work. It’s about as real as you can get because real means boring.

For those who drive Office and get off on crisp crisp Outlook performance the advantage goes to the Core i9-12900K which clocks in 16 percent faster than its Ryzen rival. Diving into each of the individual applications Procyon places the 12th-gen Core i9 at 14 percent faster in Word 19 percent faster in Excel 10 percent faster in PowerPoint and 19 percent faster in Outlook.

IDG IDG IDG

Our last real-world test uses Google Chrome 95 and runs three popular browser-based benchmarks: WebXprt 3.0 JetStream and Speedometer. WebXprt 3.0 simulates an array of browser-based tasks such as photo enhancement stock option pricing online homework and an OCR scan. The results are almost a wash with the 12th-gen Core i9 being about 3 percent faster than the Ryzen 9 5950X overall.

The Intel chip pulls in a better win in JetStream 2 though which measures JavaScript and WebAssembly peformance. The test actually combines portions of once popular but now abandoned tests such as SunSpider Octane 2 JetStream 1 and a few others. The good news for the Core i9-12900K is a clear performance edge of 15 percent which should lead to a little crisper performance over Ryzen.

The final browser test Speedometer 2.0 gives the 12th-gen Core i9 even more of an advantage. The test is fairly light weight and is designed to measure the responsiveness of a web app by “timing simulated user interactions.” The Intel chip has a 21 percent higher score which again should lead to slightly snappier feel in a browser over a Ryzen chip.

IDG IDG IDG

Gaming performance

We’ll close out our application performance testing in a category that is probably the most important to many but we frankly see as a little less grounded in actual reality: Gaming. It’s not that we don’t think gaming is important—because it is—it’s just that focusing on it sometimes ignores what’s going on. First for our game testing we stuck with a 1080p panel with a 240Hz refresh rate which is probably the optimal conditions where a faster CPU would matter.

Overall if we had to declare a winner it would be the Core i9-12900K. There were certainly a few ties in our results but by and large the wins lean towards the 12th-gen Core i9 over the Ryzen 9 5950X. We saw the 12900K with enough double-digit leads that to say otherwise would be wrong.

Does it really matter? No not really. Gaming is still largely bound by how fast of a GPU you have and worrying about a Core i9-12900K vs. a Ryzen 9 5950X probably doesn’t yield the return on investment you’d think it would. They’re both spectacular gaming options. Your time would be better spent trying to just score a fast graphics card.

With that said you just want to know what the best CPU is gaming is and we declare it to be the Intel Core i9-12900K.

IDG IDG IDG

Power consumption

Before we wrap this up we do want to dig into the power consumption of Intel’s 12th gen Core i9 chip. Rumors have been running rampant that the CPU would be a gas guzzler and it can be—but only when you mash the gas pedal to the floor on an all-core load. The actual answer is a lot more nuanced. To measure this we took our two systems outfitted with the same amount of RAM the same model coolers the same model GPUs the same model PSUs and the the same model SSDS and simultaneously measured how much power they consume at the wall. Sure you say you want to know how much the CPU alone consumes but that’s not how you pay your power bill.

We should note that the scale on the vertical axis of the first chart actually runs from 60 watts to 340 watts and the 0 is for the horizontal axis for time. We first run Cinenbench R20 using all cores and you can see the 12900K (red) pushes a total consumption of 320 watts—or nearly 100 more watts than the Ryzen 9 5950X (purple) pushed to the max. That’s about 45 percent more power. Once both chips are done with Cinebench on all cores we run the chips using a single-core or thread. We now see the total system power of the 12th-gen Core i9 in the 115 watt range while the Ryzen 9 consumes about 10 watts more. You can also see the Core i9 finishes the test faster and then idles using less power than the Ryzen 9 system.

IDG Total system power trace of the 12th gen Core i9-12900K and Ryzen 9 5950X while running Cinebench R20. IDG IDG

To see how it plays out in a more practical test we then simultaneously recorded the power consumption of both systems while Procyon 2.0 is running Photoshop and Lightroom Classic. You can see the Ryzen 9 is actually using more power than the 12th gen Core i9 in both applications. The upshot is that yes the 12th-gen Core i9 can indeed guzzle down the electricity but in actual practical use it tends to be fairly energy efficient.

Thread scaling

We’re going to close this out where we began: Cinebench. For this evaluation we run Cinebench R20 from one thread to the maximum number of threads each CPU has. We do this because not all applications use all cores nor a single core. You may find a mix so this lets us visualize where the advantage might be for a particular CPU.

We’re going to borrow from our 11th-gen Core i9-11900K review results. Even though they are on Windows 10 it shouldn’t change too much in a pure CPU Cinebench R20 test like this.

The generational performance change from Intel’s 11th-gen to the 12th-gen is nothing less than phenomenal. Using a single-thread the Core i9-12900K is 42 percent faster than its predecessor and just climbs from there. By the time we max out the last-gen Core i9 at its eight threads the 12th gen Core i9 is a jaw-dropping 82 percent faster. It’s an absolutely stunning change from the 11th-gen chip that was just introduced by Intel in March. While we don’t have have direct power traces we can tell you the older 11th-gen Core i9-11900K used nearly 380 watts to run Cinebench R20 while the 12th gen Core i9 is around 320 watts. So it is significantly faster while using far less power too.

IDG IDG IDG

While it comes as no surprise that Intel’s older 11th-gen Core gets utterly pummeled by the new 12th-gen chip what matters more is how the Intel Core i9-12900K compares against AMD’s mighty Ryzen 9 5950X. With 16-cores of Zen 3 goodness this is no pushover like 11th-gen Core i9. The results in fact are a lot closer when we run Cinebench R20 from a single-thread to the maximum amount of each chip but clearly one is generally better—and that’s the Core i9-12900K.

What’s really interesting is to see the 18 to 26 percent lead from one core to eight cores on the 12900K. At that point the 12th-gen Core i9 runs out of its high-performance cores and we presume Windows 11 begins throwing work at the efficiency cores. No matter: It’s enough to keep the 12900K ahead of the Ryzen 9 5950X. Both are dead even by the time the physical cores of both are reached at 16 threads. But then the 12th gen Core i9 gets a second wind and reaches its peak performance at its full 24 threads. The Ryzen 9 does ultimately end Cinebench R20 with the same score but for many of those lighter loads the 12th-gen Core i9-12900K should lead the way.

Intel Core i9-12900K conclusion

Here’s a secret: There is no such thing as the “best” CPU.

Instead it’s really about what the best CPU is for your particular needs. To parse that out of the thousands of words we’ve just written we’ll break it down into six categories that matter and which chip won each one. The good news for Intel is that it’s sitting pretty in just about every category.

Rendering / High-thread count

In the high-thread count applications and rendering the Core i9-12900K wrung out some impressive as hell wins such as Cinebench R23 but enough of the results we saw in other CPU-rendering results makes this far more nuanced. Frankly if we were picking a chip for a 90 percent rendering PC the Ryzen 9 5950X is probably the better choice. Winner: Ryzen 9 5950X.

Content creation

As we’ve seen content creation isn’t just about having the most threads and the 12th-gen Core i9 has everything from a fair to excellent performance bump over the Ryzen 9 5950X. If you mostly drive Photoshop Lightroom Classic or Premiere Pro the better choice is going to be Intel. Winner: Core i9-12900K.

Real-world

The benchmarks in both Office productivity and Chrome tell us the more responsive CPU will be Intel’s. We fully believe that but we also believe that a Ryzen 9 5950X can drive both use cases just fine. And well if you’re building a high-end desktop rig to run Outlook Word and browse the Internet as the number one thing—you could probably take it a few notches down. Winner: Core i9-12900K.

Gaming

We’ve said we think you should concentrate more on the GPU than the CPU for real-world gaming gains but in our gaming tests Intel’s 12th-gen Core i9 clearly notches more wins or matches than the Ryzen part. Yes it’s the “best gaming CPU” but you really can’t go wrong with either. “Winner”: Core i9-12900K.

Features

Intel’s 12th-gen platform ushers in the new world of PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 memory. It’s also more likely to get you Thunderbolt if you need it and even has integrated Wi-Fi 6E. Sure some will say DDR5 isn’t worth it today and that’s fair but there’s enough newness here that it would simply be wrong to not declare this one for Intel. Winner: Core i9-12900K.

Value

Some still think AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X wasn’t a great value while others think a $750 CPU that offered performance on par with a $2000 CPU from the year before was a steal. If you’re in the camp that thinks the Ryzen 9 price was a steal than Intel’s aggressive $589 pricing of the Core i9-12900K will have you screaming for the company to take your debit card. Yes the price is the bulk price but traditionally the 1000 unit “tray” pricing is within dollars of the street price once initial demand settles. So yes hell has frozen over because the value winner here is Intel. Winner: Core i9-12900K.

In the end the Core i9-12900K is a stunning return to greatness and one hell of an impressive CPU. Alder Lake was worth the wait. Bravo Intel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWk5LTEyOTAway12cy1yeXplbi05LTU5MDB4LTU5NTB40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X: Alder Lake and Ryzen 5000 Face Off,"The Intel Core i9-12900K vs AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 9 5950X rivalry is a heated battle for supremacy at the top of the mainstream desktop PC market. Make no mistake Alder Lake represents a cataclysmic shift in Intel's battle against AMD's potent Ryzen 5000 chips throwing the AMD vs Intel wars into a state of disarray. We've become accustomed to easy wins for the Ryzen chips — they've absolutely dominated our list of Best CPUs for gaming and our CPU Benchmark hierarchy for the last year — but Intel's new design philosophy is a game-changer.



Alder Lake's new hybrid x86 design represents Intel's most disruptive architectural shift in a decade. The chips combine big and fast Performance cores (P-cores) for latency-sensitive work with a smattering of small and powerful Efficiency cores (E-cores) that chew through background and multi-threaded workloads. Alder Lake's new next-gen connectivity technologies also bring big increases in throughput via DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 interfaces outstripping AMD's venerable AM4 platform.



But pricing trumps all. Intel has decided to be incredibly aggressive with its newest line of chips perhaps looking to smash the Ryzen revolt once and for all. As a result the $589 Core i9-12900K's pricing lands between the $799 Ryzen 9 5950X and the $549 Ryzen 9 5900X. Still it regularly trades blows and even beats the 5950X in many threaded applications that have become Ryzen's uncontested stomping grounds like Cinebench.



It isn't all sunshine and roses for Alder Lake though. Intel made a few decisions that impacted the value proposition like launching the chips without the affordable B- and H-series motherboards that tend to be the favorite for mainstream gamers. The new hybrid design also has a few early teething pains in Windows 10.



All of this means this is anything but the clear-cut victory it appears to be on the benchmark charts. Below we've put the Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 9 5590X in a six-round faceoff to see which chip takes the crown in our gaming and application benchmarks along with other key criteria like power consumption and pricing. Let's see how the chips stack up.

Features and Specifications: Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5950X and Ryzen 9 5900X

Swipe to scroll horizontally Intel 12th-Gen Core Alder Lake-S and Ryzen 5000 Specifications and Pricing Row 0 - Cell 0 U.S. Price Cores | Threads P-Core Base/Boost E-Core Base/Boost TDP / PBP / MTP DDR4-3200 L3 Cache Ryzen 9 5950X $799 16P | 32 threads 3.4 / 4.9 GHz - 105W DDR4-3200 64MB (2x32) Core i9-12900K / KF $589 (K) - $564 (KF) 8P + 8E | 16 Cores / 24 threads 3.2 / 5.2 GHz 2.4 / 3.9 GHz 125W / 241W DDR4-3200 / DDR5-4800 30MB Ryzen 9 5900X $549 12P | 24 threads 3.7 / 4.8 GHz - 105W DDR4-3200 32MB (1x32)

Intel's hybrid architecture brings what we would normally consider 'odd' thread arrangements. That's because the P-cores are hyper-threaded while the E-cores only have a single thread.



As a result Intel's $589 16-core Core i9-12900K comes with eight P-cores that support hyper-threading and eight single-threaded E-cores for a total of 24 threads. That's a 33% increase in thread count over the previous-gen Core i9-11900K. The P-cores have a 3.2 GHz base and peak frequencies reach 5.2 GHz with Turbo Boost Max 3.0 (this feature is only active on P-cores). Meanwhile the E-cores have a 2.4 GHz base and stretch up to 3.9 GHz via the standard Turbo Boost 2.0. The chip is also equipped with 30MB of L3 cache and 14MB of L2.



The 12900K comes with the integrated UHD Graphics 770 engine with 32 EUs that run at 1700 MHz. That's a big advantage over the graphics-less 5950X and 5900X so if you don't plan to use a discrete GPU Intel wins by default. Intel also has the Core i9-12900KF which is identical to the 12900K but lacks the Intel UHD Graphics 770 engine for $564.



Intel has replaced its old TDP rating and now uses a Processor Base Power (PBP) value (PL1) in place of TDP and a secondary Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) value that represents the highest power level during boost activity (PL2). You can read more about that change here.



The 12900K comes with 125W PBP (base) and 241W MTP (peak) power ratings but be aware that Intel changed its default boost duration for all K-series chips to an unlimited value. This means the chip can always operate at the 241W MTP when it is under load though the actual power use will vary with application intensity.



The 12900K faces off with the 12-core 24-thread Ryzen 9 5900X and the 16-core 32-thread Ryzen 9 5950X. These chips come with 32MB and 64MB of L3 cache respectively only have high-performance cores and have a 105W TDP rating. Both chips support DDR4-3200 memory and the PCIe 4.0 interface.



The Core i9-12900K has a big lead in terms of connectivity. All Alder Lake chips support DDR4-3200 or up to DDR5-4800 memory (odd DDR5 population rules apply). Alder Lake chips also expose up to 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and an additional four lanes of PCIe 4.0 from the chip for M.2 storage. These new technologies add cost to the Z690 motherboards that house the chips and the current pricing for DDR5 memory is eyewatering. However Intel's Z690 supports DDR4 too but it appears that you'll only find DDR4 support on lower-end Z690 boards. Intel hasn't launched the value-centric B- and H-series chipsets yet so platform pricing will be high for now.



Intel also added 12 lanes of PCIe 4.0 to its chipset (in addition to its 16 lanes of PCIe 3.0) and now offers a total of 28 lanes. Intel has also widened the DMI connection between the chip and the chipset which now serves up twice the throughput. The increased DMI throughput is also beneficial for Z690's bolstered connectivity options like the new second USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 20 Gbps connection (other new features are listed here).



Winner: Intel

AMD has earned plenty of kudos for supporting its AM4 platform for five years (and counting) largely because enthusiasts don't have to upgrade motherboards every time they get a new chip. But it has also restricted forward progress on the connectivity front. Intel's Z690 platform has a clear connectivity advantage: With DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 on the menu AMD's aging AM4 platform is simply outclassed. Those new features do make for more expensive motherboards from Team Blue but there are options for DDR4 variants to save you at least some coin.

Given its new hybrid architecture with two types of cores Intel's core counts aren't directly comparable to AMD's due to their different capabilities. Our performance results will dictate the value of the overall designs.

The Core i9-12900K comes with integrated graphics by default though you can sacrifice those for a slightly lower price point. Meanwhile AMD has no high-end options that come with integrated graphics so Intel wins by default if you need an iGPU. None of these chips come with a bundled cooler either.

Gaming Benchmarks and Performance: Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5950X and Ryzen 9 5900X

Remember this article is an overview of our much more in-depth testing in our Intel Core i9-12900K and Core i5-12600K review. We're focusing on our Windows 11 test results in this article but be aware that you could encounter odd performance in some cases with Windows 10. We have the full details and Windows 10 testing in our review.

Below you can see the geometric mean of our gaming tests with the Core i9-12900K vs the Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X at 1080p and 1440p with each resolution split into its own chart. As per usual we're testing with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 to reduce GPU-imposed bottlenecks as much as possible and differences between test subjects will shrink with lesser cards or higher resolutions.

The $549 12-core Ryzen 9 5900X is AMD's fastest gaming chip but the $589 Core i9-12900K is 8.7% faster in the cumulative 1080p gaming measurement across our entire test suite. And that's with both the DDR4 and DDR5 memory configurations so you won't have to drop serious cash on a DDR5 kit to get there.



Moving over to 1440p pushes the bottleneck to the GPU so the difference between the chips shrinks tremendously. At 1440p the 12900K is just 3.6% faster than the Ryzen 9 5950X meaning price could be a determining factor if you game at higher resolutions. Gamers with lower-resolution panels with high refresh rates will benefit more from the 12900K's faster frame rates.



Flipping through the 99th percentile charts shows larger deltas between the chips but we have to view those with caution. Windows 11 is still a bit raw and seems to suffer from more framerate variability than Windows 10. This could stem from yet-to-be-updated game code the relatively new GPU drivers for Windows 11 or some other combination of factors that could improve in the future.



Intel's Alder Lake takes a convincing lead in Windows 11 but the big wins in a few of the games can greatly impact these types of cumulative measurements. For instance Intel takes a big lead in Hitman 3 but that game is specifically tuned to leverage the E-cores by offloading low-priority tasks like audio and physics to the small cores. That type of arrangement could become more common though. For example Intel says that streaming your gaming session with OBS which now runs on the smaller E-cores can result in 84% more fps than its prior-gen chips. We're working on putting that to the test but it does show that the E-cores could have a big impact on gaming as more games and applications add support.



We also included our overall gaming results with Windows 10 at the end of the album. We generated these values with a different set of games from our previous Windows 10 test suite but they show that much of what we see in Windows 11 carries over to Windows 10 as well. Except for one thing: DDR4 memory yielded better gaming results than DDR5 in Windows 10. We expect that will change as DDR5 matures.



In Windows 10 the 12900K with DDR4 is 7% faster at 1080p than with DDR5 which naturally impacts its position relative to the Ryzen 5950X and 5900X. With DDR5 the 12900K is 2.4% faster than the Ryzen 9 5900X but that expands to a 9.5% advantage with DDR4 memory.



The AMD vs Intel gaming competition is closer now with some games favoring one architecture over the other. As such it's best to make an informed decision based on the types of games that you play frequently. Be sure to check out the individual tests in the above album. In either case Intel holds the lead.

Winner: Intel



The Core i9-12900K not only delivers a massive gen-on-gen gaming boost for Intel but it also accelerates past AMD's Ryzen 9 5900X and the Ryzen 9 5950X during all of our tests in both Windows 10 and 11. That lead also applies to both the DDR4 and DDR5 configurations — Alder Lake wins on all fronts.



Of note: The Denuvo DRM falsely identified Intel's E-cores as a separate system and thus 22 Denuvo-enabled game titles currently don't work with Alder Lake chips. Ten of those games are expected to be patched by the middle of November 2021 and Intel has issued guidance on a workaround that fixes the issue for all impacted titles. You can read about the simple fix and find the impacted games here. Denuvo says that all affected games will be patched soon.

Application Performance: Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5950X and Ryzen 9 5900X

We're focusing on Windows 11 application test results for this article but be aware that we encountered subpar performance in Windows 10 with some of the programs that worked perfectly in Windows 11. These problems arise due to a lack of software optimizations for hybrid architectures.

There are methods to correct those issues in Windows 10 but it could require some manual adjustment until more patches arrive from software vendors. Aside from the odd performance in the Handbrake x264 y-cruncher Corona and POV-Ray tests our comparative Windows 10 performance results largely mirrored what we see in Windows 11. Again head to our review for more detailed information.

Image 1 of 10 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. The first slide above shows the geometric mean of performance in several of our most important tests in each category but be sure to look at the expanded results below.

The deltas in favor of Alder Lake are very convincing in the overall measure — the Core i9-12900K is 20% faster than the Ryzen 9 5900X and 17% faster than the Ryzen 9 5950X in the single-threaded tasks listed in the chart title. That's impressive.

Naturally those big performance deltas won't carry over to every type of workload but flipping through the album of test results reveals that the Core i9-12900K does truly dominate in this type of work. In fact the Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X don't win in a single lightly-threaded test.

Image 1 of 20 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Intel held the single-threaded crown for years before the Ryzen 5000 chips arrived so it isn't entirely shocking to see it retake the crown. However the multi-threaded test results are a bit more surprising.

Alder Lake delivers a few stunning wins in the threaded workloads that Ryzen has dominated for so long highlighting the advantages of the x86 hybrid architecture. It's almost surreal to see the 24-thread Core i9-12900K with DDR5 memory tie the 32-thread Ryzen 9 5950X in the overall multi-threaded ranking but even more surprising to see it take a 3% lead with DDR4. That's pretty impressive in light of the 5950X's $800 price tag.

Flipping through the slides finds the 16-core 24-thread 12900K battling toe-to-toe with the Ryzen 9 5950X in what used to be its uncontested turf. The Core i9-12900K is 3.9% faster than the Ryzen 9 5950X in the threaded Cinebench test and 17% faster in POV-Ray showing that the hybrid architecture exposes exceptionally strong performance despite the lesser thread count. On the other hand the 5950X takes the lead in a few of the other threaded applications but by surprisingly slim deltas given its much higher price tag. Remember the 12900K's pricing is closer to the 5900X.

Meanwhile the Core i9-12900K simply outguns the Ryzen 9 5900X in these workloads. The 12900K also beats both Ryzen 9 chips in threaded encoding tasks like Handbrake x264 and x265 SVT-HEVC and SVT-AV1. Additionally from the exceedingly branchy code in the LLVM compilation workload to the massively parallel molecular dynamics simulation code in NAMD the 12900K impresses in heavily-parallelized high-throughput applications.

Winner: Intel

Performance values in a vacuum are meaningless: The true relevance of a benchmark result has to be taken in the context of pricing.



Intel's Core i9-12900K took a stunning lead in single-threaded workloads winning across the board. The 12900K also beat the Ryzen 9 5900X in every multi-threaded workload while beating the Ryzen 9 5950X in a surprising number of threaded benchmarks.



The 12900K suffered a few losses in heavily-threaded workloads to the Ryzen 9 5950X but those losses were slim considering the $210 difference between the chips. The 12900K's superior blend of both single-and multi-threaded performance not to mention its pricing easily throws the scales in its favor.

It is noteworthy that the Core i9-12900K can suffer in some multi-threaded workloads in Windows 10 due to difficulties with code that has certain prioritization settings. You can correct those issues either via command-line utilities or third-party software like Process Lasso and receive the full expected performance. Some vendors have already addressed these teething pains and we expect the industry to correct many of those issues over time. However it is important to know that Windows 10 could require additional handholding to extract the utmost performance from the Alder Lake processors.

Overclocking: Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5950X and Ryzen 9 5900X

We have long since reached the land of diminishing returns for overclocking the highest-end chips from both AMD and Intel and that includes the Ryzen 9 5900X Ryzen 5950X and Core i9-12900K. Because AMD has pulled Intel into a heated dogfight for performance superiority on the high end so much of the overclocking frequency headroom is rolled into standard stock performance. As a result you'll find larger overclocking gains with the downstream models.



Both Intel and AMD expose a wealth of tunable parameters along with sophisticated software overclocking utilities like XTU and Ryzen Master. They both also support per-core frequency and hyper-threading control (enable/disable) to help eke out more overclocking headroom.



With Rocket Lake Intel added support for real-time memory frequency adjustments though motherboard support will vary by model and vendor. This feature allows you to shift from say DDR4-2933 to DDR4-3200 from within Windows 10 without rebooting.

Now the company has expanded that with Dynamic Memory Boost. This new tech works with both DDR4 and DDR5 and allows the system to dynamically switch between standard memory frequencies and timings and an XMP profile meaning that it will auto-overclock the memory as needed based on the current usage pattern. And yes this occurs while the operating system is running and doesn't require a reboot — it's a real-time dynamic adjustment. Intel also continues to support its existing mechanism for live memory timing adjustments from within the operating system giving users a plethora of on-the-fly memory overclocking options.

Intel has long locked overclocking to its pricey K-series models while AMD freely allows overclocking with all SKUs on almost any platform. However we see signs of some improvement here from Intel as it has now enabled memory overclocking on its B- and H-series chipsets with the 500-series chipsets and it appears that the same policy will hold true with the 600 series.



AMD's Ryzen 5000 chips come with innovative boost technology that largely consumes most of the available frequency headroom so as we see with Intel's flagship there is precious little room for bleeding-edge clock rates. In fact all-core overclocking with AMD's chips is lackluster; you're often better off using its auto-overclocking Precision Boost Overdrive 2 (PBO2) feature that boosts multi-threaded performance. AMD also has plenty of Curve Optimization features that leverage undervolting to increase boost activity.



In contrast Intel's Alder Lake chips seem to be constrained by heat output — we obtained a 5.2-GHz overclock on the P-cores and a 4.0 GHz overclock on the E-cores with DDR5 locked in at DDR5-5200. We're sure a better cooler would allow us to push even further though it would come with an unacceptable increase in power consumption. However chip quality can vary for both vendors so these values should serve as a general indicator of possible overclocking headroom.

Winner: Tie

Both platforms have a wealth of tunable parameters for enthusiasts their respective overclocking advantages and a suite of both auto-overclocking and software utilities. There's also still room for a sizeable performance boost from overclocking the core fabric and memory meaning this contest will often boil down to personal preference.

Power Consumption Efficiency and Cooling: Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5950X and Ryzen 9 5900X

Intel's Core i9-12900K is far more power efficient meaning it draws less power for each unit of work done than its predecessor. Yes Alder Lake still sucks more power than AMD's Ryzen 5000 series chips but the Intel 7 process marks a big improvement over the old power-guzzling 14nm Rocket Lake chips — we measured a peak of 238W with the 12900K while the previous-gen 11900K drew nearly 100W more during the same Blender workload.

Alder Lake is also much faster than its predecessor earning it some leeway. As you can see in our renders-per-day measurements the Core i9-12900K and 12600K are both twice as efficient as their predecessors which is impressive.

Overall Intel has reduced its power consumption from meme-worthy to an acceptable level. The Core i9-12900K ran just fine with our 280mm liquid cooler so you should budget for an equivalent or better water or air cooler.



The last four slides in the above album tell quite a bit about Intel's improved power efficiency. In these charts we calculate the cumulative amount of energy required to perform the workloads. We plot this 'task energy' value in Kilojoules on the left side of the chart. These workloads are comprised of a fixed amount of work so we can plot the task energy against the time required to finish the job (bottom axis) thus generating a really useful power chart.

Bear in mind that faster compute times and lower task energy requirements are ideal. That means processors that fall the closest to the bottom left corner of those charts are best. It's easy to see that Intel has made a massive generational improvement here.



However AMD still holds the advantage in all of the key power criteria with the Ryzen 5000 models retaining the crown of the most efficient desktop CPUs that we've ever tested.



Winner: AMD



Intel has made plenty of progress but AMD still holds the crown of the most power-efficient chips. Not only do they suck less peak power but they also accomplish more work per unit of power consumed. That results in an across-the-board win in power consumption efficiency and thermal output so you'll end up with a cooler and quieter system. None of the chips in our faceoff come with a bundled cooler but you'll need a beefier cooler to contain the Core i9-12900K than you will for the Ryzen processors.

Pricing: Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5950X and Ryzen 9 5900X

The Core i9-12900K comes with a boatload of performance for its $598 price tag and you can even go graphics-less to save some coin with the $564 Core i9-12900KF model. That's exceptionally competitive pricing against AMD's ~$549 Ryzen 9 5900X that trails the 12900K in every meaningful benchmark and also against the $799 Ryzen 9 5950X that scores shockingly few (narrow) wins against the 12900K. (Notably you can find the 5900X on sale for around $524 at times and Microcenter has had sales for $499.)

Platform pricing comes into play though and there are a lot of caveats with a Core i9-12900K-powered system. Naturally DDR5 memory is the elephant in the room but that equation is pretty simple: You should expect to pay a massive early adopter premium for DDR5 memory and more for the higher-end DDR5 motherboards. As such if you're planning on going the DDR5 route you should plan to pay handsomely — DDR5 memory is mostly out of stock or up to 50% more expensive than DDR4. If you choose to build a DDR5-equipped system expect the extra costs to outweigh what you would pay for a 5900X-powered system and possibly a 5950X system too. If you're looking for bang-for-the-buck DDR5 is off the table for now (hopefully prices will recede soon).

Luckily DDR4 offers nearly the same performance in the majority of workloads. So if you aren't after professional-class (i.e. time equals money) performance in workloads that benefit from DDR5 like professional video editing applications and the like DDR4 will more than suffice for an Alder Lake system. These systems will be built on Z690 motherboards for now as Intel hasn't released the B- or H-series chipsets yet. However while plenty of high-end Z690 motherboards support DDR5 most (if not all) of the DDR4-compatible Z690 boards land in the lower- to mid-ranges of the Z690 stack.

It's still a bit early to get the complete picture on motherboard pricing Alder Lake launched just this week and we're seeing the normal spotty availability but here are a few like-for-like comparisons (pricing is valid only at the time of publication):

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Price MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 $154 MSI X570-A PRO $209 ASRock Z690 Phantom Gaming 4 $180 ASRock X570 PHANTOM GAMING 4 $154 ASUS Prime Z690-P D4 $220 ASUS PRIME X570-P $172

As you can see we're looking at price deltas that range from $26 to $55 between the X570 and Z690 DDR4 motherboards with the latter being more expensive. Of course you'll have to add in those costs if you plan to build around the 12900K. However given that AMD's AM4 ecosystem is more robust due to B- and H-series availability you can even step down a bit further for a 5900X or 5950X-based system.

However there are a lot of intangibles at play. Generally we would expect a Core i9-12900K chip and DDR4 motherboard to cost roughly $100 more than a Ryzen 9 5900X on a similar board and ~$75 to $100 less than a Ryzen 9 5950X combo with similar trimmings.

Winner: Tie

Intel Core i9-12900K systems outfitted with DDR5 memory will come at a big premium that might not be worth the slim performance gains over DDR4 in most applications. Given the early state of DDR5 availability it's hard to nail down firm estimates. However the high pricing of DDR5 isn't worth it for most users which removes one of the key reasons to go with an Alder Lake system.

Given the additional connectivity you gain with the Z690 platform not to mention the performance advantages of the chip Intel's Core i9-12900K comes out ahead if you're building around a DDR4-based system. Core i9-12900K platforms built around DDR4 memory should be more expensive than a similar system than a Ryzen 9 5900X and slightly less expensive than the Ryzen 9 5950X. Factoring in the Core i9-12900K's exceptional performance and more modern chipset with advanced connectivity options it wins the pricing war for DDR4-based systems. That yields a tie in this section.

Bottom Line

Swipe to scroll horizontally Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 9 5950X Row 0 - Cell 0 Intel Core i9-12900K AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X Features and Specifications X Row 1 - Cell 2 Gaming X Row 2 - Cell 2 Application Performance X Row 3 - Cell 2 Overclocking X X Power Consumption Efficiency and Cooling Row 5 - Cell 1 X Pricing X X Total 5 3

The Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X battle ends in a five to three win in Intel's favor. It might seem odd that we put the Core i9-12900K up against both the Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X especially with the latter being around $200 more expensive but that's because the 12900K has the performance chops to challenge both chips. As such we expect AMD to reduce pricing soon perhaps bringing 5950X pricing closer to the 12900K.



Software updates should help resolve many of the early issues in Windows 10 but you might need to engage in some manual tweaking for some specific programs. However despite those early hiccups with Windows 10 Intel's gamble to adopt a hybrid x86 architecture has clearly paid off.



The Core i9-12900K lands at $589 for the full-featured model and $564 for the graphics-less variant. The 12900K delivers incredible performance in threaded workloads often rivaling or beating the $799 Ryzen 9 5950X but at a much lower price point. Yes the Ryzen 9 5950X does beat the 12900K in some threaded work but by surprisingly slim deltas given its higher pricing. Additionally the 12900K beats the ~$499 to $549 Ryzen 9 5900X in all performance metrics. If you're looking for snappy performance in lighter fare the 12900K is also the uncontested leader in x86 single-threaded performance bar none.



The Core i9-12900K is the fastest gaming chip on the planet regardless of if you use Windows 10 or 11 or DDR4 or DDR5. AMD will fire back with its 3D V-Cache processors that will come with up to 192MB of L3 cache per chip which the company says imparts up to 15% more gaming performance. Those chips arrive next year but the impact on gaming beyond eSports titles is unknown.



Alder Lake's advantages also include platform connectivity but DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 interfaces will add some cost in the early days. Support for DDR4 can help reduce that overhead but we haven't seen any flagship DDR4 motherboards yet; the highest-end models appear to be confined to DDR5. Luckily you won't need expensive DDR5 memory to unlock the best gaming performance — unless you have a very specific need for DDR5 it's probably best to skip it until it matures further.



Intel's very aggressive pricing gives it the overall lead against AMD's competing Ryzen 5000 chips at least if you're building a DDR4 system. The competitive pricing could also take some of the sting out of the high platform costs associated with the Z690 motherboards that are currently the only option for Alder Lake systems. If you're going with a DDR5 build prepare yourself for eye-watering pricing at least until supply improves. Eventually we'll see B- and H-series motherboards come to market which should help reduce platform costs.



AMD still holds the power and efficiency crown but the 12900K's new 'Intel 7' process reduces power consumption by up to a third and nearly doubles power efficiency reducing AMD's massive advantage in that key area. Overall if we take performance into account Intel has reduced its power consumption from meme-worthy to an acceptable level.



Overall the Core i9-12900K marks a massive generational leap forward for Intel in nearly all facets including gaming performance in lightly- and heavily-threaded work power consumption and efficiency and platform connectivity options. Paired with aggressive pricing the Core i9-12900K wins the faceoff with the Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X in convincing fashion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vaW50ZWwtMTJ0aC1nZW4tYWxkZXItbGFrZS1jcHUtd2luZG93cy0xMC0xMS1zdHJlYW1lcnMtbXVsdGl0YXNraW5nLTA0NTcwMTkxOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Streamers beware: Intel's 12th Gen CPUs and Windows 10 aren't friends,"If you're looking to get the new 12th Gen Intel CPUs you might want to consider upgrading from Windows 10. (Photo: REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya)

When Intel officially announced Alder Lake to the media they had a slide stating that the 12th Gen processors would run best on Windows 11.

Even prior to the official announcement there were little tweets in the rumour mill that Microsoft and Intel have been collaborating behind the scenes to make Intel’s new big.LITTLE architecture run at its most optimal on Windows 11.

This piqued my curiosity about the performance differences of the new Intel chips between Windows 10 and Windows 11.

Initially I only intended to do a performance comparison test of games between Windows 10 and Windows 11 since Yahoo Gaming SEA focuses a lot on popular games and esports titles.

However I noticed an odd CPU behaviour during my testing of the 12th Gen CPUs on Windows 10 which prompted me to change my approach in reviewing the i9-12900K and the i5-12600K.

In fact if you are really interested to know about the raw performance that the 12th Gen CPUs are capable of there are reviews and comparisons already available to the public from various media outlets for your consumption.

Now let’s get to the meat of the article.

Intel's 12th Gen Alder Lake i9 and i5 CPUs (Photo: Yahoo Gaming SEA)

Two different types of CPU cores

Most of Intel’s 12th Gen models come with two different types of CPU cores the P-cores (Performance cores) and the E-cores (Efficiency cores).

Both the i9-12900K and the i5-12600K that were tested in this article contain a combination of these cores. The P-cores are the powerhouse of the chip being able to boost up pretty high in clocks while also having multithread enabled on them.

The E-cores however have low boost clocks with no multithreading enabled but are extremely power efficient.

To take advantage of these cores Intel has implemented something called the Thread Director. To explain it in the simplest way possible it is able to let the operating system know which are the P-cores and which are the E-cores and what each core’s individual load is.

It essentially “suggests” to the operating system on which core is free which thread can be used or freed up which core is able to handle the programmes that are running on the system etc be it a demanding programme or something as simple as a web browser.

The Thread Director essentially is the brain of the 12th Gen CPUs.

The Windows element

On Windows 11 this runs flawlessly for games and multitasking. Windows 11 is built with a scheduler that is able to recognise the information provided by the Thread Director and delegates the running programmes accordingly to the relevant CPU cores.

The 12th Gen CPUs run symbiotically with Windows 11 creating the ultimate OS and platform that can multitask and run several programmes at once without much flaws.

On Windows 10 however this isn’t present.

Instead of recognising the cores as performance vs efficiency Windows 10 just recognises the cores as high-performance vs low-performance.

This method of core recognition is fine on older CPUs because all cores are mostly equal with one or two cores being able to boost slightly higher than the average core clock present in the CPU (which will then be classified as the “high-performance” cores).

Windows 10 still thinks this is the case for the Intel 12th Gen CPUs and will sometimes send programmes that are in need of a powerful CPU core to an E-core leading to stunted performance due to the nature of the efficiency cores..

In my testing I noticed that this is more often than not detrimental to users that game and have other programmes running at the same time especially with a game capture or streaming software present.

The test bench is as follows:

Intel Core i9-12900K or Intel Core i5-12600K

2x 16GB TeamGroup T-Force Delta RGB 6000Mhz CL40 DDR5 RAM

Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero

Asus AMD Radeon 6900XT Strix

1TB Adata XPG GAMMIX S70 Blade PCIe Gen4 SSD

Seasonic Prime GX-1000 PSU

Asus Ryujin II 360mm CPU AIO Cooler with LGA 1700 bracket

Here are the graphs one running on Windows 11 and one on Windows 10. Both will have results with only the game running and a combination of the game + OBS. I will not put in the 1% low results for these graphs because that is not the main point of focus for this article.

Intel Alder Lake performance on Windows 11 (Image: Yahoo Gaming SEA)

Intel Alder Lake performance on Windows 10 (Image: Yahoo Gaming SEA)

As you can see from the graphs something is definitely up with how the chips are run on Windows 10.

Looking through the data from monitoring software like HWinfo and Rivatuner it is very clear that when Windows 10 decides that the E-cores should take over the workload of running the game the fps will dip significantly.

This mostly happens when there are multiple CPU intensive programmes running at the same time in this case OBS.

I also didn’t expect the programmes to remain running under the E-cores for that long. In older CPUs Windows would usually just delegate whichever core that is available to a programme. Depending on the priority of the programme Windows will attempt to push the more “important” programmes to the higher performance cores. So it is definitely a little weird that the games remain being run by the E-cores.

A not ideal solution

There is a solution for this anomaly — by manually assigning the programmes to run on specific cores of the CPU but that is unnecessary and tedious work especially for a PC user who is not into tweaking these things.

I have repeated the tests three times on three fresh installs of Windows 10 for the 12900K and the results still remains the same.

I have tried replacing OBS with XSplit and Streamlabs OBS and still face the same problem. I have also tried to open the usual programmes that a streamer would have like Discord Epic Games Store and Steam running in the background.

While it didn’t introduce any extra performance hit it didn’t really fix anything either so it was just for me to confirm it is a bad idea for a streamer to remain on Windows 10 if they want to upgrade to Intel’s 12th Gen CPUs.

The Windows 11 story

Performance on Windows 11 however is immaculate.

Running multiple programmes at the same time introduces very minimal performance hit and one could argue that the fps dips may be in the margin of error anyway.

You can clearly see the Thread Director and Windows 11 working in tandem here. Opening up more programmes also does not introduce any kind of performance degradation because of the way the OS delegates the tasks to the 12th Gen CPU cores.

To be fair the games tested here have generally high fps. Even with the performance hit from Windows 10 it is still in the playable range. The E-cores are strong enough to hold up the demands of high framerates.

If your games are GPU bound this shouldn’t be an issue too. But compromising like this definitely isn’t ideal especially when you’ve spent your hard-earned cash on Intel’s most capable consumer CPU up to date.

There is only one moral of today’s story:

If you want to use the 12th Gen CPUs to their fullest potential you have no choice; you must use Windows 11.

Or you can choose to wait till Windows 10 releases a fix for this but I highly doubt they will. Why allow users to use an old product when you can force them to use a newer one?

The Alder Lake processors managed to overcome the wall of Apple M1 chips that previously headed the table and both the power-hungry i9-12900K and i5-12600K reached scores of over 4000 points.

Alder Lake has shown some serious performance chops on PassMark with the Intel Core i9-12900K and Intel Core i5-12600K soaring to new heights on the CPU Mark desktop single-thread performance chart. For many months this table had been topped by the Apple M1 SoC which finally relinquished its position to fellow Apple Silicon recently in the forms of the M1 Pro (8-core and 10-core) and the M1 Max. We speculated how long the new M1 variants would last at the top of the CPU Mark chart opining that the i9-12900K and i5-12600K could do some damage…and they have.

The all-conquering single-core/single-thread speed demon that is the Intel Core i9-12900K has taken up the top position in the desktop chart with an astonishing score of 4255 points. This is only based on the testing of four samples so the margin for error is still high although that also means the score could even get higher which is what happened with the Apple M1 earlier this year. The i9-12900K’s score places it +9.69% ahead of the nearest Apple Silicon rival the 10-core M1 Pro.

Arguably the star of the show here is actually the Intel Core i5-12600K especially as its MSRP of US$289 is so much lower than the US$589 MSRP listed for the i9-12900K which is actually selling in some places for nearly US$900. The score for the i5-12600K is a very credible 4067 points although the margin for error here is even higher as it is based on a single sample appearance. The 10-core Alder Lake part has a significant turbo boost advantage over the Apple Silicon and can reach a 4.9 GHz clock rate.

While the chart looks very healthy for Alder Lake and it certainly seems like an incredible initial appearance by the Intel Core i9-12900K and i5-12600K on the surface there is one factor that cannot be ignored – power draw. Although the individual PassMark records for the M1 Pro and M1 Max don’t mention TDP (M1 is listed at 15.1 W) a thorough examination courtesy of AnandTech has shown that single-thread workloads don’t require much power at all and the highest draw was 92 W in a CPU/GPU stress test (M1 Max in MacBook Pro 16). The i5-12600K has a recorded typical TDP of 150 W and the i9-12900K hits 241 W according to their PassMark listings.

She decided to consider the pitch from venture capitalist Isabelle Freidheim for one reason.

“It took some convincing a little bit. I wasn’t sure if I had the right capabilities. I have always sat on the entrepreneur side. So to be on the acquiring/money side is a new perspective and vantage point for me” she said. “I don’t think I would have taken the call if it wasn’t the fact that it was an all-female SPAC.”

That’s how the Seattle entrepreneur ended up with Freidheim and the Athena team at the New York Stock Exchange this week as they rang the opening bell a week after raising $230 million in an initial public offering. Next on Athena’s agenda is the process of identifying and acquiring a consumer-oriented company leveraging those funds.

Park is believed to be the first Korean-American woman to take a company public as CEO on the NYSE.

A Yale Law School graduate and former Starbucks executive she went on to found and lead Julep Beauty a physical retail chain and e-commerce brand that was acquired by private equity giant Warburg Pincus. She went on to found sustainable gift-wrap company Tokki leading the company through a pivot during the pandemic.

She’s also a board member of the Washington State Opportunity Scholarship which holds its 2021 OpportunityTalks Breakfast at 8 a.m. on Tuesday Nov. 9.

On this episode of the GeekWire Podcast Park talks about the ambitions of Athena’s team the future of consumer brands in the Amazon era her own life story and her family’s experience as immigrants.

On the symbolic significance of her new role: “It’s super meaningful to have me ringing the bell to have that visual step. It’s another reason why I wanted to take on this role and this challenge. … My dad was an orphan. When all of the stuff was happening with our borders it really made me think about what it means to be separated. He was walking home from school one day and he was on the South side and his parents were on the North and he hasn’t seen them ever again since he was nine. He was taking care of his sister who was six. And she would cry at night and ask for her parents. He had to just figure things out. … So for somebody like that to see his daughter achieve something like this in just two generations it is really meaningful for him. And it took a lot of sacrifice and hard work on their part.”

On the immigrant ethos: “I think one of the most important constructs you have in your mind as an immigrant is that you can travel through different worlds. And once it’s possible for there to be more than one world then you can make up your own rules. … [Growing up] the rules inside my house were so different than the rules outside my house. I had to develop some translation muscles pretty early to say ‘Both of these worlds can be true both are valid both are amazing and flawed in their own ways.’ ”

Athena’s chances of acquiring a women-led company: “We’re looking for really great management teams. Look the truth of the matter is that it’s really unfortunate that there are not as many women-led companies in the unicorn billion-dollar ready to-go-public stage as there should be. Only 2% of venture funds go to women-led companies. … That’s what we’re dealing with. So yes we would love to work with a phenomenal team. It would be a huge bonus if it was run by a woman. And we would love to extend what we’re doing on gender equality and how we think about the world. But it that’s definitely not a defining characteristic [of the potential acquisition].”

Tokki’s gift bows and QR code adoption: “There has been obviously nothing good about the pandemic nobody would sign up for this. But one thing that has happened is that people are using QR codes. At the beginning half of our website was explaining how to use a QR code. … Now I am 100% sure that the answer would be 100% of the people who are scrolling Instagram know how to use the QR code. And only 10% of our audience did about a year and a half ago.”

Amazon third-party aggregators and consumer brands: “I can see the consolidators having a reasonable play. Where they are going to be strong is not with consumer brands that have the love of a consumer but around selling a widget more thoughtfully in a more operationally efficient way. .. It might be like the new CPG company like CPG back in the day consolidated brands and they consolidated operations and delivered to grocery stores in a more efficient way.”

When they get worried these days their concerns are about phenomena that are well-known at this point like the Delta variant and supply chain snags.

But Michael Wilson chief investment officer and chief US equity strategist for Morgan Stanley says there is still an economic slowdown coming — and investors who think it's going to be short-lived are missing the boat.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""We have been expecting a material slowdown in both economic and earnings growth amid a mid cycle transition"" he wrote in a recent note to clients. ""The Delta variant is not the primary reason why growth has slowed in our view. Instead we think it's simply a more dramatic mid cycle transition than normal given the speed and velocity of the recovery so far.""

He also writes that the supply chain problems will last longer than most traders expect and demand from consumers is going to be weaker than they believe.

""We think the growth slowdown will be worse and last longer than expected — i.e. well into the first half of 2022 as the payback in demand arrives with the sharp y/y decline in personal disposable income"" he said.

It's well-known that Americans built up a lot of savings during COVID thanks to stimulus payments and the absence of many forms of non-streaming entertainment and leisure. While some prognosticators think those savings will keep the economy afloat for a while Wilson says the money has been spent and consumers are roughly back to pre-pandemic savings levels now.

He added that a survey by National Public Radio and Harvard found that 59% of households with less than $50000 in annual income reported severe financial problems in the last few months while 38% of all households said the same.

That helps explain a recent dip in consumer confidence and it could mean people are about to spend far less than investors think they will. Wilson suggests that that's a setup for economic and stock market disappointment even before factoring in the supply chain issues and other problems.

""A key message from us over the next several weeks is to stay selective and to stay more defensive in terms of positioning"" Wilson wrote. ""We continue to like relatively reasonably priced Software over Hardware and Semis in Tech Services over Goods in Discretionary Financials and Healthcare.""

That creates a more defensive portfolio with less supply chain risk he said. At the same time he updated his firm's Fresh Money Buy List by removing tech giant Alphabet.

""GOOGL has been a top performer since the end of March.

The report calls on policy makers investors and forest product customers to leverage the potential of sustainable working forests and their products in the transition to a net-zero economy.

The report launched at COP26 in Glasgow was developed by FSG members in consultation with 21 key stakeholders and support from PwC Canada. It describes the role of forests and forest products in supporting the transition towards a net-zero nature positive and equitable future for 9+billion people to live well within planetary boundaries by 2050. The Roadmap focuses on three levers that constitute the unique potential of the forest sector to support the net-zero transition:

Reduce greenhouse gas emissions in operations and across the value chain;

Increase carbon removals through sequestration in sustainable working forests and storage in forest products;

Grow the circular bioeconomy through the substitution of non-renewable and fossil-based materials with forest products.

The climate change mitigation potential of all three levers is cumulative and forest companies are encouraged to act on all simultaneously while prioritizing emissions reductions. The report also supports forest companies in their decision-making by describing key opportunity spaces where business can take action to realize the potential of all three levers. As sustainable working forests and their products are often overlooked as a solution to reach net-zero to drive impact at scale policymakers investors and customers must recognize and leverage this potential.

A second report will follow in 2022 providing guidance for business in the forest sector to drive ambitious and science-based net-zero strategies based on global accounting frameworks and best practice examples.

FSG members include: BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group CMPC Drax Group Enviva Hancock Natural Resource Group International Paper Company Mondi Group New Forests Philip Morris International Sappi Limited Smurfit Kappa Group Stora Enso Sumitomo Forestry The Navigator Company Weyerhaeuser.

Annika Bresky President and CEO of Stora Enso and member of WBCSD’s Executive Committee highlighted that “The forest sector has the opportunity to become climate and nature positive. But the forest sector alone cannot bring to market the solutions the world needs to transition to a net-zero and nature-positive economy. It will require concerted and collaborative action across the full value chains and with investors civil society and governments.

Francisco Ruiz-Tagle CEO CMPC added that “As stewards of sustainable working forests and manufacturers of wood-based products the forest sector faces a unique opportunity to enable the global transition to a net-zero economy through the provision of scalable and cost-effective solutions for carbon capture and storage. A change in mindset within the sector and beyond will allow to unleash the full transformative potential of the forest sector.”

Diane Holdorf Executive Vice President WBCSD highlighted that: “It has been very encouraging to see so many big announcements in this Climate COP to address deforestation and land use change. But now is the time for urgent collective action. The Forest Sector Net-Zero Roadmap launched today by WBCSD members and partners delivers a blueprint to accelerate mobilization of the full forest sector value chain to drive the inclusive net-zero and nature positive future we urgently need.”

All they have gotten though is buzzwords that bring little change even after a new push from the city and business leaders said Sheldon Butts the four-year former city council member and West End native.

As redevelopment happens all around the historic Black neighborhood residents fear being priced out of their generational homes but the West End doesn’t need people to come in and tell them how to fix their issues Butts said.

A local Realtors association teamed up with the city and brought in a nonprofit partner Oct. 19 and 20 in attempts to find solutions to dilapidated structures. The nonprofit's representatives Frank Alexander and Jazz Watts suggested forming a community group — which the West End already formed years ago.

Butts was hoping these experts on neighborhood revitalization would spark real ideas for change in the West End but instead he and others in the community came away from the visit feeling let down once again.

“That's a shame on me I expected something different this time” Butts said.

A professor of economics at Columbia University from 1969 to 2013 he anchored the international economics group there for more than four decades. He will be remembered by colleagues and students for his brilliant intellect his encyclopaedic knowledge of theory and history and most of all for his modesty warmth and supportive friendship.

Findlay was born and raised in Burma but was forced to flee the country on foot during the Second World War.1 After the war he returned and later received an excellent education at the University of Rangoon. A precocious student Findlay was appointed as a teaching tutor at the age of 19 and he was giving economic advice to the Burmese government in his very early 20s.2

In 1957 Findlay went to graduate school at MIT where Robert Solow was his dissertation adviser. He was also deeply influenced by Charles Kindleberger and “the master” Paul Samuelson. As a graduate student Findlay published several papers including his 1959 classic with Harry Grubert “Factor Intensities Technological Progress and the Terms of Trade”. This paper examined the impact of Hicks-neutral and factor-biased technological change on production and factor allocation in a simple two-good two-factor model. This influential analysis illuminated some important features of that workhorse model and it continued to be influential when the issue of factor-biased technical change returned to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s.

Findlay completed his PhD in just three years and returned to Burma to teach at Rangoon.3 One early paper stepped into the minefield of the Cambridge versus Cambridge capital theory and sought to formalise Joan Robinson’s model of accumulation something that had to be done “due to the obscurity of Mrs. Robinson's literary presentation of what are fairly intricate quantitative relationships” (Findlay 1963). The paper not only elicited a reply from the formidable Cambridge economist she even made a special trip to Burma (detouring from India) just to “have it out with this young Findlay guy” as he later put it.

This paper and other early work displayed what was a trademark Findlay approach: to provide a formal model of what was implicit in the non-mathematical writings of economists such as Arthur Lewis and Ragnar Nurkse. The goal was to provide a check on the underlying logical structure of non-traditional approaches and see under what conditions the claims for them might hold. For example Findlay (1959) showed that a policy of “balanced growth” as advocated by Lewis and Nurkse would not solve the problem of increasing the returns to investment and could be counterproductive compared with international specialisation along lines of comparative advantage.

Burma’s future darkened after a 1962 military coup began the country’s slide into political repression and state socialism. In 1965 General Ne Win asked two competing groups of economists to propose an economic strategy for the military government. Findlay joined with colleagues in proposing an outward-oriented trade and foreign investment strategy with market prices for rice farmers and other agricultural producers. The alternative proposal from Marxist economists advocated tight government controls and inward-focused socialist development that would extract resources from agriculture.

A representative from each group met with the general but the debate was no contest: the plan endorsed by Findlay was swiftly rejected as “something the CIA would come up with”.4 The result was an “unmitigated economic disaster” as Findlay (2016) described it with the so-called Burmese Way to Socialism leading to a repressed and isolated economy that remained impoverished for decades.

The political situation in Burma made it difficult for him to remain there. Fortunately in an unsolicited act of generosity Harry Johnson the leading international economist of the day reached out to Findlay and helped him receive job offers at Princeton and Columbia. Findlay chose Columbia which he joined in 1969 and where he remained for the rest of his career.

Findlay was a Mozart of trade theory. He was enormously creative combining clean and elegant geometry with simple and uncluttered mathematics in his papers. His hallmark approach was to start with a simple small-scale general equilibrium model and modify some of the basic assumptions to yield fresh insights into some topical question. He brought his gifts to a wide range of topics including tariffs and trade policy; oil shocks and employment; capital time and trade; wage differentials and economic development; primary exports and industrialisation; and North-South models.

Many of his papers focused on the uneasy connections between trade and development. As he once put it: “In a sense I have been trying throughout most of my professional career to reconcile Haberler and Viner representing the great tradition of Ricardo Mill Marshall and Edgeworth on comparative advantage and the gains from trade with the insights and concerns of Lewis and Nurkse about development” (Findlay 1984b: 23).

He was a genius at modifying some of the basic assumptions of standard models to incorporate the apprehensions of some economists about the interchange between rich and poor countries. He seriously and respectfully considered the views of Lewis on unlimited supplies of labour Nurkse on balanced growth Prebisch on centre-periphery asymmetries Emmanuel on unequal exchange and many others. He did so in order to probe the conditions under which their unconventional conclusions would stay intact.5

He was particularly adept at integrating trade into basic growth models to address the complaint that standard theory was static and could not address issues of growth and dynamics. His 1970 Journal of Political Economy paper “Factor Proportions and Comparative Advantage in the Long Run” elegantly showed how comparative advantage would evolve according to the propensity to save and the growth rate of the labour force.

One of his most cited papers “Relative Backwardness Direct Foreign Investment and the Transfer of Technology: A Simple Dynamic Model” published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1978 examined how a country’s distance from the technological frontier would create the opportunity for foreign investment to close that gap. And he introduced Prebisch-style North-South asymmetries in his 1980 American Economic Review paper “The Terms of Trade and Equilibrium Growth in the World Economy”.6

If the 1970s was a trade and development decade for Findlay the 1980s saw him turn to the political economy of trade policy and the state. In papers written with his colleague Stanislaw Wellisz the goal was to “endogenise” policy – that is to have it become the outcome of a particular political process. The famous 1982 Findlay-Wellisz paper “Endogenous Tariffs the Political Economy of Trade Restrictions and Welfare” became a widely-cited starting point for later work on explaining protectionist policies across countries.

In the 1990s Findlay developed the field of “clio-theoretics” – the use of trade theory to illuminate economic history.7 He was a master practitioner of using small-scale general equilibrium models to analyse some of the biggest events in world economic history such as the Black Death the opening of trans-Atlantic trade the 18th century triangular trade and more.8 He would start as always with something like a two-factor two-good model but with deft skill he would modify it appropriately and extend it fruitfully. He would endogenise the frontier endogenise technological improvement endogenise capital accumulation endogenise fertility endogenise time preference and much more – all in the service of exploring some fascinating historical phenomenon.

This clio-theoretic work was backed by his encyclopaedic reading of political and economic history. His landmark 2006 book co-authored with Kevin O’Rourke Power versus Plenty: Trade War and the World Economy in the Second Millennium provides a masterly overview of world economic history from 1000 to 2000.

Findlay was a tremendous teacher and his impact in the classroom was as great as his influence as a researcher. At Columbia he taught international trade to hundreds of graduate students from around the world. Findlay’s clarity of expression deep knowledge and amazing insight and intuition made him an admired and memorable teacher.

I will never forget his vivid opening words on the first day of class. Unlike macroeconomists he told us trade economists “do not slit the throats of our ancestors” Instead trade economists respect tradition and build on the work of their predecessors from Smith and Ricardo to Heckscher and Ohlin Haberler and Viner down to the present age. He was an enthusiastic fan of Ricardo – less for his theory of comparative advantage than for his thinking about trade and growth (Findlay 1974). And he especially revered the Swedish dynamic duo of Heckscher and Ohlin whose rich insights on factor endowments he explored throughout his career (Findlay 1995).

His graduate trade course was a tour-de-force a beautiful blend of mathematical trade theory (as in Ron Jones) with geometrical trade theory (as in Max Corden).9 His mastery of all trade theory enabled him to lecture without any notes – a truly impressive performance. (I distinctly recall the one single class in which he brought a small index card with a few equations jotted down; it was memorable only because it was unusual.)

Of course the standard 2X2 model was the foundation but he considered all sorts of modifications and extensions to that foundation opening up a wealth of possible thesis topics that would draw students into the field. More than anything else he emphasised three things: general equilibrium general equilibrium general equilibrium. (Once that lesson was learned the next lesson was endogenise endogenise endogenise.)

As a lecturer he had a gift for simplifying the complex and clarifying the obscure without sacrificing rigour. His approach was simple but not simplistic and he presented sophisticated material without needless complication. He left students with an appreciation of the ability of simple trade models to shed light on all sorts of situations. His personal kindness and patience won him the affection of legions of students.

“I have always maintained that a good teacher is always more important than a good school” Findlay said perhaps reflecting his Rangoon undergraduate education (Turnell 2019: 154). Those of us fortunate enough to study with him encountered not just a good teacher but a great teacher. Moreover he worked hard to make Columbia a great school for international economics. He was a key figure in building the international group by recruiting Robert Mundell Guillermo Calvo Jagdish Bhagwati Carlos Diaz-Alejandro and many others to the faculty.

Findlay’s role in presiding over the weekly international seminar at Columbia was just as important to the educational process as his classroom instruction. At the seminar he would often leave the attendees in awe of his uncanny ability to make the paper comprehensible and point out its true contribution both of which often eluded the presenters themselves. Within the first ten minutes Findlay would see through the logical implications – and weaknesses – of the analysis faster and farther than anyone in the room. He did so with quiet and unassuming modesty. When he pointed out the flaws or shortcomings in the analysis which he did not hesitate to do for the benefit of the graduate students sitting along the wall he did so gently.

In a fitting arc to his career Findlay returned to economic policy in Burma as the prospects for economic and political change improved in the 2000s. In various reports and visits to the country Findlay argued that Burma had to make up for lost time by opening up to international trade and investment. “It is imperative not only for the regime but for the nation as a whole to single-mindedly focus on the need to catch up as rapidly as possible with the achievements of its Southeast Asian neighbors” Findlay (2012) insisted: “The key to this is an export-oriented development strategy” much as he had proposed about 50 years earlier.

Findlay was always a liberal in the best sense of the word. Although he was never dismissive of the development economists of the 1950s who believed that developing countries should turn inward to avoid being harmed by their engagement with the international economy Findlay (1984a: 24) said “my instincts were always more ‘outward looking’” – something he attributed to the insights of his compatriot Hla Myint. Having seen firsthand the tragic results of Burma’s closed economy approach with its extreme nationalism and xenophobia he could never truck with illiberal economic policies.10

His personal experience demonstrated to him the benefits of international openness to trade investment ideas and people. Yet he was never dogmatic about trade policy. Furthermore he believed open trade was not enough to satisfy standard conditions of justice; international labour mobility was essential too as he noted in his 1982 paper “International Distributive Justice” published in the Journal of International Economics.

Findlay’s colleagues and students will miss his warm and supporting friendship his laughter and his keen insights that went far beyond economics. As Kevin O’Rourke (2021) has so aptly put it: “Ron had the wisdom and knowledge that comes with age but retained a boyish enthusiasm and impishness that made him a joy to be with: the schoolboy was never very far from the surface.”

4 As Findlay (2014 106-7) noted the plan “called for a strong export-oriented approach revising the existing pricing system for paddy purchase to give more incentives to farmers and in general for Burma to follow its evolving comparative advantage in the world economy as the best path towards progress and prosperity.” The alternative proposal was for “nationalization and economic control along old-style Stalinist lines”. See also Brown (2013: 139ff).

5 In his collected papers he described his work as follows: “each paper develops a model derived from a rich tradition of classical and neoclassical trade theory and applies it to a relevant analytical or historical question... I hope these that these papers demonstrate the power of trade theory to illuminate issues not only within its conventional boundaries but especially outside them in the fields of development history and political economy” (Findlay 1993: xii)

7 The term was coined by Max Corden to describe Findlay’s work. His splendid 1998 address “A Plea for Trade Theory in Economic History” makes the case that “small-scale tractable general equilibrium models that are the workhorses of trade theory are also powerful engines of historical analysis and inquiry.”

Although recent clinical data continue to expand possible treatment options for lupus nephritis whether belimumab or voclosporin should be the first-line therapy remained hotly contested during the ACR’s annual Great Debate.

Michelle A. Petri MD MPH director of the Hopkins Lupus Center at Johns Hopkins University and Brad Rovin MD from the department of nephrology at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center weighed in on whether belimumab (Benlysta GlaxoSmithKline) or voclosporin (Lupkynis Aurinia) is the more attractive option for lupus nephritis.

“In patients with a bad biopsy with many bad prognostic markers I don’t think we should be using mycophenolate alone” Michelle Petri MD said in her presentation. “We should be very comfortable starting either a calcineurin inhibitor or belimumab right at the get-go.” Source: Adobe Stock

“We are all well aware of the huge unmet need of lupus nephritis” Petri said. “In my cohort in patients who develop nephritis in the first year 20 years later 20% are in end-stage renal disease.”

In her defense of belimumab Petri laid out several considerations including efficacy at 1 year and in the long-term; efficacy in class V disease; efficacy among Black patients in non-renal parameters in preventing organ damage and in preventing GFR reduction.

Michelle A. Petri

Regarding early outcomes Petri cited the pivotal phase 3 BLISS-LN trial investigating standard of care alone vs. standard of care plus belimumab in patients with lupus nephritis.

“The curves separate almost at the beginning of the trial” she noted regarding the primary endpoint of renal response as assessed by creatinine of less than 700 mg. “The delta is actually bigger just before and after the 52-week mark.”

While Petri stressed that comparing clinical trials with different study designs and outcome measures is “not fair” she highlighted a similar study investigating voclosporin. She noted that in comparing the two drugs all subsets favored belimumab except among patients with pure class V disease. While voclosporin demonstrated a stronger result belimumab was also effective. “In time to renal event or death by 8 weeks the curves separate in favor of belimumab with a very nice P value” she said.

In another comparison of outcomes for the two drugs Petri looked at time to first renal flare in Black patients. While the delta for this outcome failed to reach statistical significance in the belimumab study it did reach statistical significance among the 45 Black patients included in the voclosporin trial.

Turning to extra renal outcomes Petri noted that in the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Lupus Network study 30% of patients had these complications. “The benefit of belimumab beyond the kidney has been proven in the original phase 3 trials” she said.

If there was another important take-home message for Petri it pertains to the capacity of belimumab to stem the tide of organ damage. “It has been shown in novel analyses to prevent time to organ damage progression” she said highlighting findings from the BLISS trial.

Turning to GFR outcomes Petri once again compared belimumab and voclosporin trials. She noted that while the curve for voclosporin in this outcome runs slightly below the standard of care belimumab protected GFR “virtually from about 3-4 months.”

In defending voclosporin Rovin framed the discussion in terms of five key arguments. The first is that the two key clinical trials that led to the approval of voclosporin demonstrated one clear outcome: “The combination of voclosporin plus mycophenolate is more effective than mycophenolate alone” he said.

Brad Rovin

These studies also offered another critical consideration for rheumatologists treating lupus nephritis namely that patients treated with the combination of voclosporin and mycophenolate require “much less glucocorticoid” than those treated with mycophenolate alone. “This translates into fewer adverse events” he said. “And maybe more importantly adherence to these regimens. Certainly adherence to glucocorticoids is a big issue.”

For his third argument Rovin piggybacked off the point made by Petri that voclosporin has shown improved efficacy in Black patients. He added that the drug has demonstrated strong outcomes in patients of Hispanic and non-Hispanic ethnicity. “The third argument in favor of voclosporin is that the combination is effective in patients of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds” he said. “That is relevant to the treatment of lupus and lupus nephritis as you know.”

His fourth argument addressed the speed with which voclosporin can reduce proteinuria. “Rapid response is actually kidney protective overall” Rovin said. “Time is nephrons in these inflammatory diseases.”

The final point Rovin offered pertained to safety parameters. He noted that in the key trials that led to the approval of the drug pooled adverse event rates showed no difference between voclosporin and controls in terms of serious events or infections.

“There was an imbalance of deaths in the phase 2 trial but not in the phase 3 trial” he said noting that the increase was likely not dose related. However he suggested that “extraneous circumstances"" including drug adherence and access to care may have led to this outcome.

Ultimately both Petri and Rovin believe that while there are specific points that argue for belimumab or voclosporin there is room for both drugs in managing the diverse patient population of lupus nephritis.

“It is time to change our paradigm” Petri said. “In patients with a bad biopsy with many bad prognostic markers I don’t think we should be using mycophenolate alone. We should be very comfortable starting either a calcineurin inhibitor or belimumab right at the get-go.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Red Kettle campaign will kick off Friday and continues through Christmas Eve Dec. 24.

“A successful season is vital to ensure our agency is able to carry out our mission each year — especially during such trying and uncertain times” Director Tara Blagec said. “We have witnessed firsthand the impact the pandemic has had on our society sadly affecting many of our own community members.”

Blagec stressed that while society might be in the “post-pandemic” transition many individuals and families still face challenges.

“We will not allow COVID to stop us from doing what we need to do for the greater good of those we are called to serve” Blagec said. “With community support our boots will remain on the ground helping those in crisis.”

Volunteers are valuable assets in the effort to meet the seasonal fundraising goals she explained.

The campaign has more than 1400 two-hour spots to fill at the kettles which means they need a lot of bell ringers.

Volunteers are asked to do at least a two-hour shift between 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. at one of their kettle locations: both entrances of Walmart Super One Foods Tadych’s Family Market Kingsford Ace Hardware Pat’s Foods in Norway and Northwoods IGA in Niagara Wis.

Blagec said if they don’t have the ringers for time slots kettles will not be out. “We are different from other regions as we do not leave our kettles unattended” she said. “By just giving a couple hours of your time means hope for many.”

The LongRiders Motorcycle Club once again has stepped up to host kettles on the first day at both Walmart entrances.

“Jennifer and I will be at Walmart — providing cookies and donuts to kick this year off” Blagec said. “Council members will also be filling spots at other locations that day.”

They encourage friends groups or organizations to make it fun by setting challenges even singing or playing Christmas music.

Funds collected throughout the kettle season allows the Salvation Army to provide services all year — not only with short-term emergent needs such as food and clothing but social service program for 12 months.

“This type of support has allowed us to help individuals and families who have been homeless transition into stable housing and provide them with household items personal items phone minutes etc.” Blagec said. “Assistance may also be needed for utility hook-up as well as an array of other needs.”

In addition they assist with preventing individuals from becoming homeless due to unexpected circumstance or at risk of eviction or shut-off of utility service.

The Salvation Army continues to offer budgeting and do assessments to determine potential referral and linking of services to one of their many community partners such as for mental health substance abuse and more.

They need a bell ringer coordinator as well Blagec said. Anyone interested can contact the Salvation Army office at 906-779-5717.

Those interested in taking a turn as a bell ringer can call 906-239-6824.

Those unable to sign up for the kettle program can make a difference in other ways.

Community members can adopt a family or children from the Angel Tree Program.

Angel Tree tags will be available on the trees at Walmart or by contacting the office.

Shopping this year has been made easier with an online registry. Angel Tree donors can go to Walmart.com then press the three-line main menu in the upper right hand corner scroll down to registry and go to Registry For Good.

“Donors have the options of choosing a child family or just buy a toy to donate that can be used for the program.

“The online program works out great as they ship it free right to the office” case worker Jennifer Witte said.

They do ask that children’s gifts be donated unwrapped as they want to parents to be able to enjoy the wrapping.

“We provide them with gift wrap tape and tags” Witte said. “Those purchasing a gift for a parent are welcome to wrap those.”

The Salvation Army strives to be good stewards of its resources. “We continue our effort to ensure non-duplication of service” said Witte explaining that individuals who have signed up to received donations elsewhere will not be eligible for this Christmas program.

Those with questions about the program should reach out to the Salvation Army before making other commitments.

“We are offering a hand up rather than a hand out and we will continue to be here spiritually emotionally and financially for those we are called to serve” Blagec said.

Those wishing to make a monetary donation can mail checks to The Salvation Army 145 Roseland St. Kingsford MI 49802 or P.O. Box 218 Iron Mountain MI 49801.

“We are grateful for the support we receive each and every year — even last year with very limited kettle time donations came in because the community knows what ‘Doing the Most Good’ is all about” she said. “Our community has never let us down.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHBsb3JlamVmZmVyc29ucGEuY29tL2xvY2FsLzIwMjEvMTEvMDcvc3BvbnNvcmVkLXN1bmRheS1zcGVjaWFscy1hdC1jb3VzaW4tYmFzaWxzLXN0dWZmZWQtcG9yay1jaG9wLXR1cmtleS1kaW5uZXItMTAtMTIxNDYxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SPONSORED: Sunday Specials at Cousin Basils: Stuffed Pork Chop Turkey Dinner,"CLARINGTON Pa. – Unwind in the peaceful atmosphere at Cousin Basils located at the threshold of Cook Forest for one of their Sunday specials: Stuffed Pork Chop or Turkey Dinner — or order from their fine dining menu!

(NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Following on from that line of thought we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St we have a full range of analyst estimates for Jack Henry & Associates going out to 2026 and you can see them free on our platform here..

More prosecution testimony is expected in the early part of the week at the Boone County Courthouse but who is the man behind the bench?

Presiding Judge J. Hasbrouck Jacobs was selected as such for the 13th Judicial Circuit without opposition in January. He is serving a two-year term in the role.

He took over the presiding position from Boone County Circuit Court Judge Kevin Crane who was in the role for four years over two terms.

“I am honored to accept the role of presiding judge for the 13th Circuit” Jacobs said in January. “I appreciate Judge Crane’s leadership for the last few years. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues and agency partners on issues that impact our justice system.”

Jacobs received his law degree from Florida A&M in Tallahassee. He was an assistant state attorney in Florida. He also worked in private practice in North Carolina before coming to Missouri. He has previously served as an assistant prosecutor in St. Louis County and Boone County.

Jacobs was appointed to the bench in Boone County in 2017. He secured a full six-year term as circuit judge in 2018.

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcGdhLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvd2h5LWR1c3Rpbi1qb2huc29uLXNheXMtbGl2LXBsYXllcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLXJld2FyZGVkLWluLXBnYS10b3VyLW1lcmdlci83MzYyOTg3NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Dustin Johnson says LIV players should be rewarded in PGA Tour merger,"Dustin Johnson has a completely different take on those who shunned the PGA Tour for LIV Golf and those who are being hailed as loyalists for remaining on the tour.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

Johnson was placed on the 15-day injured list during the last road trip due to elbow inflammation.

Pierce Johnson is doing well Brian Snitker said. He was scheduled to throw a touch-and-feel off the bullpen mound today.



No update on Tyler Matzek. He’s been shut down from throwing for a brief period. — Justin Toscano (@JustinCToscano) May 10 2024

Brian Snitker had previously said that they didn’t think the situation with Johnson’s elbow was serious but they wanted to get ahead of it. Johnson has been a key piece of the Braves’ bullpen since he was acquired at the trade deadline last season. Johnson has appeared in 13 games and has a 3.00 ERA and a 2.83 FIP in 12 innings.

Per Toscano there was no update on Tyler Matzek who was also placed on the 15-day injured list with his own bout of elbow inflammation. Matzek has been shut down from throwing.

Matzek missed all of the 2022 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. There was initially talk of him beginning the season on the injured list but he showed enough during the spring to earn a spot on the Opening Day roster. Things haven’t gone well for Matzek though as he has allowed 11 runs in 10 innings across 11 appearances. He’s been hit particularly hard of late allowing six earned runs in his last three innings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2NoaWNhZ28uc3VudGltZXMuY29tL2JyYW5kb25qb2huc29uLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvbWF5b3ItYnJhbmRvbi1qb2huc29uLWZpcnN0LXllYXItaW4tb2ZmaWNlLW1pZ3JhbnRzLXNjaG9vbHMtYmVhcnMtc3RhZGl1bS1jcmltZS1wb2xpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mayor Brandon Johnson's roller-coaster first year in office,"When Chicagoans chose a paid organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union and rookie Cook County commissioner as their 57th mayor many knew Brandon Johnson would need to grow into the job.

They were right.

Johnson’s first year in office has been a roller-coaster ride filled with the ups of having delivered on a checklist of progressive promises — and the downs of managing contentious relationships with Gov. J.B. Pritzker the Illinois General Assembly the business community and police.

There’s even mounting tension with a City Council emboldened by Johnson’s failure to deliver on his signature promise to secure a new revenue source to combat homelessness.

In an interview with the Sun-Times and WBEZ Johnson reflected on his “remarkable journey” to the mayor’s office and the very “different trajectory” he followed to get there.

He said he’s proud of fulfilling so many items on his progressive to-do list and described a year of accomplishments tempered by impatience.

“There are frustrating moments that I do have where you … just wish you could address everything at the same time” Johnson said. “That’s just unfortunately not where we are — just because the damage has been so severe and it has been so widespread” especially in “historically marginalized” communities.

Johnson acknowledged he hasn’t made everybody happy but that comes with the turf.

“If the role of the mayor is to satisfy everyone then we would not have had 56 prior to me” he said.

Migrant crisis missteps

From the beginning Johnson has been dogged by the migrant crisis he inherited. One of his first Council meetings included a cathartic vote on $51 million in surplus funding for the crisis — after a contentious “us-versus-them” debate that reduced one alderperson to tears.

Johnson’s handling of the crisis telegraphed the freshman mayor’s growing pains. He unveiled plans for a winterized camp at a contaminated Southwest Side industrial site only to have Pritzker reject the idea amid environmental concerns.

The local alderperson a progressive ally felt blindsided by the mayor’s plan and was subsequently physically accosted by furious constituents.

The abandoned plan ended up costing Chicago taxpayers nearly $1 million.

But Johnson succeeded in emptying Chicago police station lobbies filled with migrants and returning Chicago Park District field houses to their intended use. He did that by opening brick-and-mortar shelters at a furious pace. At its peak 27 shelters held more than 14600 migrants.

“When I stepped into office … you had contracts that were bloated and it was costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of dollars. ... We’ve transformed all of that. … We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million” Johnson said.

But the biggest shelter in Pilsen was crowded and unsanitary. A 5-year-old boy there died of sepsis and it later was the epicenter of a measles outbreak.

Alderpersons are now pushing back on the mayor’s 60-day eviction policy — which was delayed three times and already has forced more than 650 people from shelters.

Johnson also stumbled by initially reneging on a deal with Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle one of his political patrons to provide $70 million in additional city funding to support migrants through 2024.

His first budget included just $150 million in funding he knew would last only until April 1. He deliberately lowballed the figure to put pressure on the federal government but the tactic failed. At one point he used $95 million in federal stimulus money to slap an end-of-year Band-Aid on the migrant crisis. But that alienated some alderpersons who control spending and were not consulted.

Johnson’s hand-picked chair of the Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee has frequently complained about being shut out of conversations about the migrant crisis including about the mayor’s eviction policy. Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) eventually strong-armed the administration into publishing regular data on evictions.

“There needs to be some work done as it relates to transparency and accountability as well as cooperation and engagement and dialogue with the alders” Vasquez said. “It’s about figuring out how to engage with everybody.”

Alderpersons’ grievances with Johnson were on full display at the last Council meeting where they called for the mayor to be more forthright about migrant funding and equal spending on long disinvested communities.

Even after the griping the Council ultimately passed two of Johnson’s top spending priorities including $70 million from city reserves for migrant spending to honor the deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle.

“I know how to count and both those votes received more than 30 votes from City Council” said Workforce Development Chair Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd). “That sounds like a win to me.”

After closing nearly a dozen shelters amid declining numbers Johnson said he’s “preparing” for a possible influx of migrants in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. But there are “limitations to what we can do” without more federal help he said.

Progress on progressive wish list

Johnson’s legislative successes have been impressive.

In the first year alone he has phased out the subminimum wage for tipped workers; pushed through the most generous paid leave policy in the country; reinstated the city’s Department of Environment; and laid the groundwork to reopen two shuttered mental health clinics.

The mayor has also begun to ease the pressure on Chicago police officers by expanding a plan to send mental health providers instead of police to nonviolent mental health emergencies.

Johnson kept his promise to put a binding referendum on the ballot that would have authorized the Council to increase the real estate transfer tax to create a dedicated funding source for homelessness prevention. But Chicago voters rejected it a major defeat widely viewed as a referendum on the mayor’s first year in office.

Mayoral allies in the Council’s Progressive Caucus heard the message loud and clear and vowed to work harder to win voters’ trust and simplify a complicated referendum that many voters didn’t understand.

“Ignoring what those critiques are and thinking that we’re just morally right isn’t going to lead to future wins” Vasquez said.

At the time Johnson responded to the defeat with bravado warning anyone who might assume one defeat would make him put the brakes on his progressive agenda to “buckle up.”

More recently the mayor won Council approval for a $1.25 billion bond issue devised by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fund housing and economic development programs. The same goes for Lightfoot’s plan which Johnson expanded to transform nearly vacant buildings along La Salle Street into more affordable residential units.

Canceling the city’s contract with the gunshot detection technology company known as ShotSpotter also delivered on a progressive promise. Johnson and his base have long viewed ShotSpotter as a surveillance tool that leads to overpolicing in Black and Brown communities.

But Johnson’s decision was somewhat overshadowed by his delivery. He announced it just days before the contract was to expire then scrambled to negotiate an extension through the historically violent summer months and the Democratic National Convention.

ShotSpotter and the broken migrant funding promise with Pritzker and Preckwinkle were the subject of a disastrous Feb. 15 news conference showcasing a communication problem dominating Johnson’s first year in office.

He evaded some questions answered in platitudes and declined to say if he’d walked away from a migrant funding deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle or nailed down the ShotSpotter extension before announcing a phase-out.

That defining moment in his relationship with the media seems to have led to a course correction. Johnson finally named a permanent communications director in Ronnie Reese who had essentially filled the role since Johnson took office. Johnson also hired a chief strategy officer Joe Calvello who learned the art of being “radically open and honest” while guiding U.S. Sen. John Fetterman D-Pa. through a difficult campaign dominated by health issues.

The changes appear to have made an impact already with Johnson taking media questions more often and answering those questions a bit more directly.

Mixed bag for business

Johnson’s aggressive agenda such as costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage put him at odds with the business community.

But labor leaders said Johnson also had displayed a willingness to compromise on both issues even as business groups kept “moving the goalposts.”

“They were looking not to compromise. They’re just looking to stop the policy. And that’s not realistic” said Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter noting similar policies have been adopted by other major cities.

Johnson also appeared to extend an olive branch with recent rollouts of pro-development policies. And his choice of seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright as commissioner of Planning and Development also was applauded by the business community.

Besides the La Salle Street plan the mayor proposed recommendations to cut bureaucratic red tape on business development and revived the long-stalled O’Hare expansion project by hammering out a cost-cutting deal with the major airlines.

Johnson also held the line on city property taxes — though he allowed Chicago Public Schools to boost property taxes to the limit two years in a row.

“It’s been a little bit up and down. Some positives. Some negatives” Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin said of Johnson’s first year adding there’s “a lot of work to be done to improve communication” and trust between the mayor and the business community.

“He has a tax agenda. We have ideas on how we can grow the economy. And we’re going to have to come together because federal money is drying up. There’s lots of fiscal cliffs and fiscal challenges coming up” Lavin said. “He’s the mayor. We’ve all got to work together. If the mayor is not successful Chicago’s not going to be successful.”

With two of four city employee pension funds hovering perilously close to insolvency Johnson has displayed some financial acumen by continuing a Lightfoot policy of making additional payments. He also appointed a working group to study the $35 billion crisis — which has yet to produce any ideas on solving it.

Goodwill from police is short-lived

Johnson’s choice of Larry Snelling as police superintendent played to rave reviews. A commanding and reassuring presence he’s already won the support of the demoralized rank and file.

The mayor also extended the police contract and sweetened police raises. But the feel-good period was somewhat short-lived.

He infuriated officers by twice asking Council members to reject an arbitrator’s ruling allowing officers accused of the most serious wrongdoing to bypass the Police Board taking their cases to arbitration.

“For a Democratic mayor to be so anti-union it’s pretty breathtaking” said Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

As expected a judge sided with the union — but agreed to make the arbitration process more public and that meant the back-to-back Council votes were more than “symbolic” Johnson said.

Johnson did keep a campaign promise to hire 200 new detectives and free officers for street duty by hiring civilians to perform office jobs. And to the consternation of some progressive allies he increased the police budget to nearly $1.99 billion.

Still Snelling told a town hall in Jefferson Park recently that Chicago remains down about 2000 officers citywide and struggles with low recruitment.

Like Lightfoot Johnson has devised a plan to get at the root causes of crime. His hyperlocal version focuses on 10 multiblock areas in four neighborhoods: Englewood Austin Little Village and West Garfield Park.

Those neighborhoods — plagued by school closings and high dropout rates while lacking public amenities like parks and libraries — will receive an array of services including priority in another round of the city’s guaranteed minimum income program.

Johnson has also put a heavy focus on creating more summer jobs and neighborhood recreational opportunities for young people to give them alternatives to a trend of mass downtown gatherings that have turned violent.

Shootings and homicides are down slightly but robberies remain stubbornly high. In neighborhoods citywide Chicagoans continue to feel unsafe waking up to reports of another wave of strong-armed robberies store break-ins and carjackings.

Reducing violent crime remains such a priority alderpersons who believe ShotSpotter is an effective prevention tool have vowed to perhaps symbolically defy the mayor and tie his hands on ending the contract.

Johnson plays Council tie-breaker

Twice in the first year Johnson was forced to cast tie-breaking Council votes: To save his now-ousted Zoning chair and floor leader Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) from censure; and to approve a nonbinding resolution for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The cease-fire resolution strained Johnson’s relationship with many Jewish leaders and the only Jewish alderperson Debra Silverstein (50th). Some Jewish elected officials and civic leaders — including the Anti-Defamation League Midwest state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz and state Rep. Bob Morgan — later declined the mayor’s invitation to a recent meeting meant to ease the tension.

But not supporting the resolution would have diminished his relationships with progressives and Arab Americans. He noted that calling for a cease-fire is in line with his values and several progressive pro-Palestinian Jewish groups did attend the meeting.

“As far as me calling for peace I hardly consider that controversial. ... The entire country and people around the world are calling for that. That’s something that we value as residents of the city of Chicago but it’s also part of our responsibility as global residents that calling for peace and an end to war is a part of our very profound tradition” he said.

The Chicago area’s large Palestinian community demanded for months that Johnson and his Council majority take a stand voicing their feelings at numerous raucous Council meetings.

The division caused by the war has spread to college campuses in Chicago and nationwide foreshadowing the civil disobedience that might occur when Democrats gather here in August to formally nominate President Joe Biden for reelection.

If Johnson is too timid he risks allowing demonstrators to run roughshod over Chicago. If he allows Chicago police to be too heavy-handed he runs the risk of civil rights violations and the inevitable comparison to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Johnson’s first chief of staff Rich Guidice a seasoned City Hall lifer was widely expected to serve through the convention bringing the expertise garnered from guiding Chicago through decades of major events. But Guidice abruptly resigned last month.

The tie-breaking vote that spared Ramirez-Rosa from censure followed his resignation from leadership after apologizing for bullying and threatening colleagues to block a symbolic referendum on whether Chicago should remain a sanctuary city.

Johnson hasn’t named a replacement for Ramirez-Rosa — either as Zoning chair or floor leader. Some Council members are demanding a replacement from the Latino Caucus but Johnson has yet to find someone he trusts who can also win alderpersons’ support.

Meanwhile some of Johnson’s progressive supporters said they believe rushing to force Ramirez-Rosa’s resignation went too far and an apology should have sufficed.

Backing the Bears puzzles progressives

Progressives were also left scratching their heads when Johnson embraced the Bears’ plan for a sprawling domed stadium south of Soldier Field — a project requiring billions of state and federal dollars that haven’t been approved or identified.

When the Bears unveiled their stadium plan Johnson acted more like a cheerleader than a guardian of taxpayers and protector of precious lakefront parkland.

Asked if the plan violated the city ordinance prohibiting new construction along the lakefront Johnson referred to the Bears’ promise of increased green space on the Museum Campus. But he failed to mention those additional 14 acres are possible only if the state and federal governments cover all $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs.

Putting the Bears stadium near the top of his legislative wish list contradicts Johnson’s campaign stance. Now though Johnson calls Soldier Field a “100-year-old building” — even though it was rebuilt in 2003. Paying off what’s owed on that renovation will drain city coffers unless the debt is refinanced in the new stadium funding package.

“If someone else has another solution that addresses this problem then they should put that on the table” Johnson said.

Every mayor loves a giant public works project. They generate jobs contracts and political donations and are a feel-good diversion from Chicago’s intransigent problems. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley had his failed 2016 Olympic bid. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel had Elon Musk’s high-speed tunnel train to O’Hare Airport.

Johnson’s stadium plan similarly appears to be going nowhere. Springfield has far higher priorities.

“The position he’s taking there … seems to run at odds with his key base of support from progressives. I understand the temptation and desire to put forward a signature project — a legacy project if you will … But it just seems like an unforced error in the way he rolled it out” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.

“Unforced errors is sort of a common theme that we are seeing in many respects. … Communication with the public and the press remains lacking” he said.

At the Bears’ announcement Johnson was “speaking in platitudes from scripted remarks” and couldn’t “really engage with the questions being asked” Greising said which undermined “his ability to earn support from people most affected by the decisions he is making.”

Pritzker did not address the Bears stadium controversy or other points of tension with Johnson saying instead: “The first year of any administration is often the most challenging and I commend Mayor Johnson and his team for reaching this milestone.”

Springfield stumbles

A stadium defeat would not be Johnson’s first in Springfield.

Last month the Illinois House voted 92-8 to approve a bill curbing the power of Johnson’s revamped hand-picked school board. A Senate committee did the same last week during Johnson’s first Springfield lobbying trip as mayor. The bill would prevent Chicago Public Schools from making any admissions or funding changes to selective-enrollment programs and from closing any schools until a fully elected school board takes control in early 2027.

There was no mistaking the message to Johnson’s board which wants to prioritize investing in neighborhood schools over choice schools like selective-enrollments. The original bill was amended to extend an existing moratorium on closing all schools and not just selective schools after lobbying by the CTU.

Asked what message he took from the vote to tie his hands on an important education issue Johnson noted it still needs final approval.

“It’s not a law so nothing has happened” he said.

An emotional CTU President Stacy Davis Gates — perhaps reflecting on setbacks like these — told supporters last fall she was “ashamed of myself” for having helped put Johnson — “my brother” she called him — in “an impossible place.”

Asked recently what made her ashamed Davis Gates talked about the resistance Johnson had faced during his first year.

“Transformation is happening right now in Chicago and every corner of the city because of his leadership. And that level of transformation either makes you a hero or it makes you a villain” Davis Gates said. “It’s not lukewarm. It’s either hot or cold and that is a very precarious position to live in.”

Remaking Chicago Public Schools

As a candidate Johnson promised to make progressive changes to CPS and he has.

His revamped board is led by former science teacher Jianan Shi who also led the parent advocacy group Raise Your Hand for Illinois Public Education. Johnson’s board is filled with others with community-organizing experience.

That board has delivered on a promise to shift away from student-based budgeting that progressives argue exacerbates challenges at schools serving low-income communities and toward a need-based funding model.

But he’s already disappointed some parents by sticking with a plan for a phased-in elected school board instead of delivering that pivotal reform in one fell swoop.

Johnson will also have to find a way to deliver for the schools parents and his former colleagues at the teachers union without breaking the bank in the CTU contract he is now negotiating. Teachers started out by demanding a 9% raise or to match inflation whichever is higher.

“I know what it takes — from a teacher’s perspective as well as a parent’s perspective and a student’s perspective — to have a more transformational educational experience” Johnson said. “And that’s what our focus has to be: funding our schools and actually transforming them so that they are fully fully expressed in an equitable way.”

CPS faces a $391 million deficit for the upcoming school year not including raises being negotiated for teachers and a 4% raise already promised to support staff. The CTA and other mass transit agencies are facing their own funding cliffs.

That’s another point of contention between Johnson and Pritzker.

The governor and others are demanding a leadership change at CTA before providing any new money. Others want to merge all four Chicago-area mass transit agencies into a single super-agency to reduce costs improve operations and create a uniform fare system.

Johnson harshly critical of CTA performance during the campaign has stuck with embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. no favorite of Chicago alderpersons.

When Pritzker dared demand a leadership change the mayor replied he alone gets to choose the CTA president adding “If people want to be mayor they should run for it.”

Room to grow into job

Johnson likes to say he intends to serve for 23 years — long enough to become Chicago’s longest-serving mayor bypassing Richard M. Daley.

But that will require him to grow and mature in the job and survive many upcoming tests. While his first budget made no real political waves the second will demand making cuts raising property taxes or finding new sources of revenue while still chipping away at his commitment to invest in people.

Despite Johnson’s gestures to the business community Greising said many business leaders he talks to “feel like they still don’t know him still don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what they can do for him — and still don’t feel heard by him.

“Every successful mayor has found a way to have the business community with him. And this mayor so far doesn’t seem to work very hard on that.

“We shouldn’t be all that surprised when we elect someone with his background that there’s a very steep learning curve” he said. “But … he really needs to invest his effort into growing in those areas where he is falling short. If he doesn’t do that with urgency then it will be too late.”

Davis Gates acknowledged the growing pains.

“For so long in this city people who have needed [the most] have been told ‘no’” she said. Now after years of “demanding a thing happens fighting for a thing to happen protesting rallying door-knocking” progressives are in charge she said.

“To make things happen those are different muscles ... The muscles that we have to develop now — not just as a movement not just as a mayor but as an entire city — is No. 1 we’ve got to get more inclusive. We’ve got to figure out how to work past our differences” she said.

It will take some time for this “new formation that we have in Chicago” to settle in Johnson said.

“The way these systems have been built particularly government they have been built in a very complex way to favor the few” he said.

“There has been sort of an unfettered access of a handful of powerful people having access to the fifth floor” the mayor said. “Maybe they’re not used to sharing. And that’s going to take some adjustment.”

Mayor's up-and-down first year in office Mayor’s up-and-down first year in office • The migrant crisis has dominated much of Johnson’s first year: The crisis exposed the growing pains of a new mayor and exacerbated historic tensions between Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities. One key setback: Johnson’s determination to locate a migrant camp at a contaminated industrial site in Brighton Park. Gov. J.B. Pritzker canceled that project over those environmental concerns.



• It’s been a mixed bag on progressives’ wish list: Johnson was able to get the Chicago City Council to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and require city employers to give their employees at least 10 paid days off a year. But voters rejected his “Bring Chicago Home” referendum which would have increased the real estate transfer tax and used the money to fund programs to reduce homelessness.



• His relationship with the business community has been rocky: He enacted those costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage but also helped developers with an initiative to cut bureaucratic red tape and his decision to move forward on a plan to convert some LaSalle Street office buildings in the Loop for residential use. And he broke a stalemate with United and American airlines to reduce costs and move forward with a massive multi-billion-dollar expansion and renovation of O’Hare International Airport.



• Unease about Johnson’s inexperience was soothed by some of his early appointments: Rich Guidice a City Hall veteran recently retired from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications returned as Johnson’s chief of staff though he lasted less than a year. Seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright became commissioner of the city’s Planning and Development Department. And Johnson’s choice as police superintendent Larry Snelling had been with CPD for years and remains popular with the rank-and-file.



• Johnson spent some of his fragile political capital in casting tie-breaking votes in the Council: One was on a symbolic resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The mayor’s other tie-breaking vote was to save Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa from censure. The alderperson Johnson’s floor leader was accused of bullying some fellow members.



• Every mayor loves a big jobs-creating public works project: Richard M. Daley had his Olympic bid Rahm Emanuel had his high-speed tunnel to O’Hare that Elon Musk was going to build. Johnson’s appears to be the Bears’ bid for a new lakefront domed stadium but jumping on board so soon when the level of public funding is so high — and still in doubt “seems like an unforced error” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.



• Johnson’s experience as a teacher plays a role: Johnson a former organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union owes his election in part to the support of that union and entered office with teachers’ support. And while he has remade the CPS board — and the board has shifted schools to a need-based funding formula he also disappointed parents by backing away from shifting to an all-elected school board right away opting instead to phase in elected members.

COURTESY JPMORGAN CHASE JPMorgan Chase and Johnson C. Smith University officials celebrated the opening of the bank's 13th Charlotte branch on Thursday. The bank also gifted $750000 to Johnson C. Smith University to expand career pathways for students interested in financial services careers.

A new banking asset is available in Historic West End.



JPMorgan Chase’s newest branch which opened Thursday at 2023 Beatties Ford Road is its 13th in Charlotte since moving into the market in 2019 and will provide financial health workshops community events and cooperative programming with Johnson C. Smith University. The staff of 10 will focus on helping more consumers in the region open accounts manage their money start businesses and buy homes.



“I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this branch in the neighborhood where I grew up” said Nicole Byers a former resident of Beatties Ford Road and the branch’s manager. “I know this area well and I know that by physically being here we are becoming part of the Beatties Ford community with a vested interest in its growth equity and financial stability.”



JPMorgan Chase also announced a $750000 investment to JCSU to expand career pathways programs for students interested in financial services careers through work-based learning and post graduate job placement. The gift also will try to grow new talent pools for the financial services industry by tackling systemic racial wealth disparities and investing in Black-serving colleges and universities.



Earlier this year Chase announced a multi-million-dollar investment in Black-owned Mechanics and Farmers Bank so that it can do more to serve its customers and clients including by increasing lending and technology assets. Durham-based M&F has a branch on Beatties Ford Road.



“Our new Beatties Ford Road branch and philanthropic investment in Johnson C. Smith University show our commitment to Charlotte in action” said Jennifer Roberts Chase’s CEO of consumer banking. “Branches can help local residents build a stronger financial foundation support small businesses as they grow and help communities become more resilient. We’re committed to supporting the Beatties Ford community and are proud to officially open our doors here.”



Black Americans are underrepresented in the financial services sector with less than 7% of professional-level employees identifying as such. The grant will support national efforts to grow a more diverse talent pool nationally as well as in Charlotte a major financial services hub.



“As a veteran of both the financial services and higher education sectors I know as well as anyone the value of a career-focused education and what that can mean for our students” said JCSU President Clarence Armbrister. “JPMorgan Chase’s focus on helping our university and our students create pathways to financial services careers will help them land roles in a high growth high wage industry.”



The investments – which are in addition to a $750000 gift to Central Piedmont Community College to develop economically mobile career pathways – are part of Chase’s $30 billion commitment to boost bring more economic opportunity in communities of color through financial health small business opportunities and housing affordability.

Instead it has become a source of division. For some the post-pandemic return to the workplace is an opportunity to re-establish boundaries between home and job and to see colleagues in the flesh. For others it represents nothing but pointless travelling and heightened health risks. Many ingredients determine these preferences. But one stands out: seniority.

Slack a messaging firm conducts regular surveys of global knowledge workers on the future of work. Its latest poll released in October found that executives are far keener to get back to the office than other employees. Of those higher-ups who were working remotely 75% wanted to be in the office three days a week or more; only 34% of non-executives felt the same way."

Bringing his experience in senior management at PepsiCo Red Bull and Big Red Inc — including overseeing the sale of Big Red to Keurig Dr. Pepper and the day-to-day operations of Red Bull — Gary Smith joins Earth Fund’s advisery board as they get ready to list their ERC-20 token on crypto exchanges in the coming weeks.

“This is my first step into the crypto space” Smith said “and I couldn’t be more confident of the team I’ve joined. As COO of Red Bull I learned the importance of having a really strong team of top-of-their-game professionals behind you and Earth Fund is no different. From my first meeting with everyone I could just tell they were a first-rate team. When you’re working with a very new company with a big exciting mission and they’ve already got an in-house creative team in-house counsel in-house dev that has worked on innumerable crypto projects and a ton of successful entrepreneurs involved then you know you’re joining something special.”

Earth Fund DAO LLC wants to use blockchain to give anybody in the world the ability to choose fund and get involved with projects that could bring about real solutions to the climate crisis.

“We’re creating the new gold standard for crypto tokens” Alex Vergara community leader says. “This goes way beyond digital currency we’re launching a crypto token that gives you entry into a community where you have a real meaningful voice in how the global approach to climate change is funded and coordinated.

By buying the token and joining the Earth Fund DAO anybody in the world will have a vote on how the Earth Fund treasury is used to fund planet-saving projects around the world. That’s why we’re so excited to have Gary on board giving us access to his years of experience growing huge global brands to make sure everybody knows that if they want a voice in their future they need to get involved with Earth Fund.”

As Earth Fund gets closer to launch the word is spreading with a fast-growing online community waiting to hear when they should buy their token get involved and start making a difference.

“Having grown a number of well-known brands one of the early signals that a project will be a success is an engaged community that buys into the brand’s vision.”

In just three weeks the Earth Fund team has managed to build an engaged community of over 65000 people. That’s a really exciting sign not just for the token launch but for the future of this project too. And as more people hear about our mission and want to buy the token to get involved we’re anticipating even larger numbers and even faster community growth.”

The native token 1Earth gives people the ability to join the Earth Fund team in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and decide how the Earth Fund treasury is used and will start its private sale in the coming weeks.

To join their community ahead of launch head to the website.

It began in the 1970s when The Eight Samurai — Intel Robert Bosch Clarion Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Hewlett-Packard (HP) (now Keysight Technologies and Agilent Technologies) Litronix (now Osram Opto Semiconductors) Hitachi (now Renesas Electronics) and National Semiconductor — established their operations in Penang.

As the E&E sector continues to grow with the adoption of new innovative and advanced technology the multinational corporations (MNCs) have created opportunities for other mid- and downstream players as well as local companies that provide supporting activities.

That explains why Malaysian semiconductor-related players are particularly strong in the area of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) and automated test equipment (ATE) as their founders and CEOs were trained by the MNCs in Penang.

Over the years Penang or more specifically Bayan Lepas has evolved into a regional electronics manufacturing hub.

However the narrative may be changing as Batu Kawan has emerged in recent years as a strong E&E cluster. Not only is the Batu Kawan Industrial Park (BKIP) expected to replicate the success story of Bayan Lepas it may even outshine its 50-year-old counterpart.

Located off Seberang Perai on the mainland of Penang Batu Kawan is intended to be the state’s third satellite town after Bayan Baru and Seberang Jaya. But does it have what it takes to become the Silicon Valley of the East 2.0?

There is no better person to ask than Invest-in-Penang Bhd CEO Datuk Loo Lee Lian who has been promoting investments in the state since 2010.

The Edge also spoke to a few prominent business executives and captains of industry including Micron Technology Inc president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and Lam Research International Sdn Bhd general manager Soon K Kuek to get their views on investments in BKIP.

“We’ll cap oil and gas sector emissions today and ensure they decrease tomorrow at a pace and scale needed to reach net zero by 2050. That’s no small task for a major oil and gas producing country” said Trudeau.

There were no specifics about what this cap might be.

According to Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault:

“We are seeking advice from officials at Environment and Climate Change Canada and Natural Resources Canada and intend to engage with provinces territories civil society labour organizations national Indigenous organizations and industry partners.”

The cap on the tar sands

On November 22 2015 shortly after Trudeau was first elected prime minister then Alberta premier Rachel Notley announced a 100-megatonne limit on carbon pollution from the Alberta tar sands.

Both Trudeau and Guilbeault welcomed this announcement. The following day Trudeau said: “We just had a strong signal yesterday about how Canadians right across the country are looking to step up and do their part in the fight against climate change.”

At that time emissions from the tar sands amounted to 70 megatonnes a year. In other words the cap allowed for a massive expansion of the tar sands.

Pipelines approved even with the cap on emissions

By November 29 2016 Trudeau approved the 890000-barrel-per-day Trans Mountain pipeline and the 760000-barrel-per-day Line 3 pipeline.

When he approved those tar sands pipelines Trudeau noted that Canada is still a “climate leader” because of the 100-megatonne cap.

Line 3 pipeline

Between November 2020 and October 2021 more than 800 water protectors were arrested opposing the Line 3 pipeline on Indigenous lands in Minnesota.

Those arrested are awaiting their trials. Most were cited with misdemeanours but many were charged with gross misdemeanours and some face felony charges which carry the potential of up to 10 years in prison.

Trans Mountain pipeline

Secwepemc land defenders also continue to oppose the Trans Mountain pipeline being built on their territories without consent.

That pipeline originally being built by Texas-based Kinder Morgan was purchased by the Trudeau government on May 29 2018 to ensure that it would be completed. Beyond the $4.5-billion purchase price the pipeline could cost $12.6 billion to finish.

Coastal GasLink pipeline

The Coastal GasLink fracked gas pipeline being built by TC Energy on unceded Wet’suwet’en territory will feed the Royal Dutch Shell-led consortium building the LNG Canada export terminal in Kitimat on the coast of British Columbia.

On October 2 2018 when investors approved the project going forward — after the National Energy Board had approved it on January 8 2016 and the federal government had authorized it — Trudeau stated: “Today is a good day.”

And by May 4 2020 the Canadian government’s export credit agency had approved a $500-million loan to build the Coastal GasLink pipeline.

The RCMP has conducted two militarized raids on unarmed Wet’suwet’en land defenders. The first was on January 8 2019 when 14 land defenders were arrested. The second was on February 6 2020 when another 22 land defenders were arrested.

There are concerns that a third RCMP raid may be imminent.

Moving forward

Ending the criminalization of Indigenous land defenders opposed to megaprojects on their territories would require a recognition of their sovereignty title and inherent rights adherence to the right to free prior and informed consent and a commitment to ending fossil fuel subsidies and the building of new fossil fuel infrastructure.

The Indigenous Environmental Network and Oil Change International recently calculated that “Indigenous resistance has stopped or delayed greenhouse gas pollution equivalent to at least one-quarter of annual U.S. and Canadian emissions.”

Included in their calculation is the 125 million metric tons of annual CO2 pollution associated with the Coastal GasLink pipeline the 175 million metric tons from the Line 3 pipeline and the 130 million metric tons from the Trans Mountain pipeline.

The criminalization of Indigenous land defenders on the frontlines of the battle against climate chaos must stop.

Wahpepah always had a love for cooking having started when she was just a kid making meals with her grandmothers and aunties. She's from Oklahoma — Kickapoo on her grandfather's side and Sac and Fox on her grandmother's side.

When Wahpepah started catering 12 years ago she realized there weren't a lot of Indigenous chefs or places to get Indigenous food. Over time she catered lots of events eventually growing her business to the point where she was preparing food for tech giants like Google Facebook and Twitter.

But whether she was cooking for her native community or Silicon Valley she would get questions about the food — about where it originated or what tribe it was from. She realized she didn't have all the answers.

""A lot had to do with a lot of historical trauma and displacement especially of our foods"" she said.

So Wahpepah set off on a quest to get those answers starting with Oklahoma.

She spoke with native farmers and seed keepers from all over the country learning more about these native ingredients and their history. She joined Food Sovereignty Alliance and went to food summits where native chefs and farmers gathered.

""We all kind of met together and it was something ... I was so missing [and] they were missing"" Wahpepah said.

Her favorite thing to learn about was seeds.

""We have so many different beautiful seeds that are from here ... I wanted to know more"" she said. ""How they're carried how they're kept and where they're kept. And you know how they grow if they're not from that area.""

After more than a decade of catering Wahpepah is opening her own restaurant. Called Wahpepah's Kitchen it will be the newest Indigenous restaurant in Oakland. She hopes her food introduces people to her culture.

""At the end of the day that's what I want: to make people fully aware or people just to realize whose land they're on"" she said.

""I feel that Native American communities Native American people are so forgotten ... and so that's my job is to actually make everyone aware how good our foods are. Everybody has their job. My job is to cook beautiful native ingredients on the on the plate.""

On the menu you can find lots of squash bison blueberry sausage with blue corn topped with huckleberries venison meatballs with blueberry sauce homemade chili and more. Her menu honors her childhood — and different tribes.

""My tribe of course. And we're sited on Ohlone land and when it comes to that we have the acorn"" Wahpepah said. ""When we have the smoked salmon it's honoring the Pomo tribe which is up north and my children are Pomo and I have family members that are Pomo. I'm honoring that.""

""I never try to dabble in something I never grew up with. This is something that made me who I am and what I embrace.""

Most of her ingredients are provided by Indigenous farmers from around the country who she has built relationships with over the years. And Wahpepah wants her restaurant to inspire other Indigenous chefs.

""I want them to know that if I can do it you can do it too"" she said. ""The more I waited the more and more I had this vision of how much my community needs me how much our community needs to see native foods on the front line in the community not just from catering.

""And if they see a restaurant maybe it can go from there. Somebody else will want to open a restaurant.""

The word oracle simple means someone who acts as a medium through whom the prophecy is sought from God.

And the investment strategy and advice from Warren Buffett surely is a prophecy and hence the title “Oracle of Omaha” sits well with him. In this article we’ll look into how is Warren Buffett Rich and his strategies to make money from the stock market. Keep Reading.

Who is Warren Buffett?

If you haven’t heard this name you are probably staying in some other world. One of the best investors to walk the face of the Earth. One of the richest person in the world. His Networth is estimated to be over $100 billion. He follows the simple strategy of Value Investing which comes from the school of Benjamin Graham.

Warren Buffett was born in the year 1930 in Omaha. He started his career as a salesperson in 1950s and formed ‘Buffett Associates’ in 1956. He made his first million dollars in 1962. In 1965 he first invested in Berkshire Hathaway and by 1965 he had full control of Berkshire Hathaway.

By 1985 his estimated net worth was $1 billion. In 2006 he took on the route of philanthropy and pledge to done 85% of his fortune over his remaining life primarily to Bill and Melinda gates foundation. Despite donating nearly $40 bn of his fortune his estimated net worth currently is over $100 bn.

The Famous Story of BKH Investor

A guy had bought 200 shares of Berkshire Hathaway in 1970s. Within a year’s time the value of his investment doubled. He sold half his shares and started a restaurant which lasted for 20 years.

And the value of the other 100 shares today is $15 million. When asked what does he do now? he replied “ Half the time I Ski and the other half time I regret selling those 100 shares”.

How Warren Buffett Makes Money?

There are two routes or ways via which this Ace Investor makes money. Let us first discuss the most obvious ones:

1) Value Investing

The philosophy is very simple invest in only those companies which have a lot of upside potential left in them and potentially give large returns on the money invested. He is a lover of reading the annual reports of the company and makes his analysis based on them.

He goes by the simple philosophy of buying something which is yet to realise its true potential ie. buying something which is available at a discounted price as compared to what should be its fair price. He has his own checklist of factors that he considers before investing. Following are some of the factors which he considers:

To be able to understand the business of the business

Consistency in generating returns is also important before making an investment decision

Long term prospect and future of the company

Rationality in cash management is also very important while analyzing the company for the purpose of investing

Companies are allowed to make mistakes but the company must be transparent and must own up to the mistakes it makes to its shareholders

The company must be focused on providing a substantial return on equity to its shareholders

And most importantly he looks at the company’s valuation like the PE ratio P/B Ration Return on Equity etc.

And after being satisfied that the company meets the above criteria he goes ahead and puts money in these companies. Some of his noteworthy investments of his include: Apple Bank of America American Express Coca-Cola Kraft Heinz Verizon etc.

2) Selling Naked Put Options

This investment strategy might come as a surprise to many (especially those who believe that warren Buffett only indulges only in long term investing) but little does one know that Berkshire Hathaway writes naked Put options worth millions of dollars.

Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway also deals in Derivatives. As a matter of fact in one of the annual reports Buffett acknowledged that Berkshire Hathaway collected a premium of more than $7.5 bn by writing naked Put options.

What does Writing Put Options Imply?

Say a trader (Mr A) is having a Bearish view on the share price movement of XYZ limited but I am of the view that the share price of XYZ is most likely to go up. So to express his Bearish view Mr A buys Put options of XYZ limited and as I am having a bullish stance on the market I end up writing the Put option to Mr A and receive fee/commission against it.

Now if upon expiry the share price of XYZ limited does not fall then the premium which i received to write the Put option becomes my Income. So the above strategy is followed by Berkshire Hathway. The only difference here is that they already have a long position in the shares of the company against which they are writing the Put options.

And they are willing to buy more if the share price comes down. But if the share price does not fall then the premium received improves the initial entry price of the shares. So there is a dual benefit of writing Put options for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway:

Either they get to buy more shares at the lower price of the company which they are willing to invest in or

The improve the entry price of the shares which they are already holding.

In Closing

Warren buffett apart from being a generous philanthropist is also an individual with sharp investing and business acumen. At the ripe age of 91 he is still as active as ever. And this Oracle of Omaha has his sights on generating more value for his investors.

We hope you got some life lessons from this article “How Warren Buffett Makes Money”. Happy Learning and Money Making!!

I ordered a precooked turkey for Thanksgiving. Two of our family members had Covid so instead of a meal for 20 or more (as we’re used to having) I was preparing Thanksgiving for just the 5 people in our home. Honestly the whole thing was a bit depressing.

This year looks very different. I’m planning a feast for 25! But guess what? I’m still ordering that turkey precooked. Here’s what I discovered last year. Without fussing over the turkey I had loads of time to focus on my side dishes and dessert. And as much as I hate to admit this part my family liked the turkey I bought way more than they ever liked turkeys I made. I’ve made peace with this and am now embracing my turkey freedom.

Maybe you don’t wanna mess with even one bite of Thanksgiving meal prep? No worries. Plenty of places will make the whole shebang for you.

It began in the 1970s when The Eight Samurai — Intel Robert Bosch Clarion Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Hewlett-Packard (HP) (now Keysight Technologies and Agilent Technologies) Litronix (now Osram Opto Semiconductors) Hitachi (now Renesas Electronics) and National Semiconductor — established their operations in Penang.

As the E&E sector continues to grow with the adoption of new innovative and advanced technology the multinational corporations (MNCs) have created opportunities for other mid- and downstream players as well as local companies that provide supporting activities.

That explains why Malaysian semiconductor-related players are particularly strong in the area of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) and automated test equipment (ATE) as their founders and CEOs were trained by the MNCs in Penang.

Over the years Penang or more specifically Bayan Lepas has evolved into a regional electronics manufacturing hub.

However the narrative may be changing as Batu Kawan has emerged in recent years as a strong E&E cluster. Not only is the Batu Kawan Industrial Park (BKIP) expected to replicate the success story of Bayan Lepas it may even outshine its 50-year-old counterpart.

Located off Seberang Perai on the mainland of Penang Batu Kawan is intended to be the state’s third satellite town after Bayan Baru and Seberang Jaya. But does it have what it takes to become the Silicon Valley of the East 2.0?

There is no better person to ask than Invest-in-Penang Bhd CEO Datuk Loo Lee Lian who has been promoting investments in the state since 2010.

The Edge also spoke to a few prominent business executives and captains of industry including Micron Technology Inc president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and Lam Research International Sdn Bhd general manager Soon K Kuek to get their views on investments in BKIP.

In a short pre-recorded speech screened at the event Saturday Trump also insisted that he had been a better friend to Israel than any other president and had taken the US-Israel alliance to new levels.

Trump took aim at Biden for efforts to reenter the Iranian nuclear deal and appeared to link the negotiations to an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas that saw thousands of rocket attacks and airstrikes between Israel and the Gaza Strip in May.

The former president pulled the US from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 in a move that led Tehran to ramp up enrichment activity after sanctions were reimposed. Israel has demanded that the US significantly bolster and expand the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action before the US agrees to restore it.

“Biden is bowing down to the Iranian leadership and threatening Israel security and safety like never before” he said stonily speaking from what appeared to be prepared remarks. “His unbelievable weakness toward the Iranian regime directly provoked a missile attack on Israeli civilians. Thousands of missiles being shot. Biden shamefully criticized and slandered the nation of Israel even when it was under attack.”

While Iran supports Hamas and cheered on Palestinian terror groups during the May flareup few analysts have seen more than a tacit Iranian hand in the conflict with little connection to the nuclear talks. During the war Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat told The New York Times that there was no intelligence pointing to an Iranian role in the fighting.

Trump rattled off a list of moves his administration made for Israel including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital moving the embassy there recognizing Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights and withdrawing the US from the United Nations Human Rights Council over its anti-Israel bias.

“No president has ever been a better friend to the State of Israel and I am proud of that” he said.

Trump’s appearance at the conference was not advertised by the RJC likely reflecting the uneasy tightrope walked by the group as it tries to navigate a party riven between Trump loyalists and those who have recoiled from the former president following his refusal to concede the 2020 election.

While most speakers praised Trump the conference was overshadowed by the recent victory of Glenn Youngkin as Virginia governor whose dark-horse win has been feted by Republicans as a blueprint for how to regroup in 2022.

Youngkin ran on many of Trump’s policies but avoided having the Republican party leader join him on the campaign trail a dance the RJC seems keen to emulate.

Trump who is thought to be mulling a 2024 run did not directly mention whether he would reenter politics but urged the crowd to help get as many Republicans elected as possible in the midterms and beyond.

“We will win back the House we will win back the Senate and we will win back in 2024 that beautiful white building sometimes referred to as the White House” he said.

The RJC’s annual conference is a fixture of the Republican calendar and was formerly seen as a required stop for conservative candidates seeking the backing of Sheldon Adelson who died in January. Miriam Adelson who had driven some of her late husband’s political spending is widely expected to continue that tradition.

Appearing at the confab were a number of other rumored possible 2024 presidential candidates including former UN ambassador Nikki Haley former secretary of state Mike Huckabee Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump’s vice president Mike Pence.

Pence told the conference that Biden had “turned his back on Israel” and urged Congress to reject a Biden administration plan to reopen a consulate in Jerusalem opposed by Israel calling it an “unlawful step.”

Despite being targeted by pro-Trump protesters storming the US Capitol on January 6 Pence was effusive in his praise of the former president saying it was “the greatest honor of my life to serve as vice president with president Donald Trump.”",,,,,,,,,

Live Nation Entertainment the largest live music promoter in the world has been fined or sued for issues ranging from unruly crowds to equipment failures at various venues and concerts in the past decade.

The security measures in place at Friday's Travis Scott-fronted music festival in Houston are among the numerous protocols that will be scrutinized. Eight people ranging in age from 14 to 27 were killed and hundreds injured in a crowd surge during Scott's headlining set.

Astroworld: Everything we know about the tragedy at Travis Scott's music festival

“It may well be this tragedy is the result of … events and couldn’t possibly have been avoided” said Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo at a news conference Saturday. “Live Nation had a security plan with NRG Park. Perhaps the plan was inadequate. Perhaps (plans) were good and weren’t followed. Perhaps it was something else entirely.”

At this year's event at the 350-acre NRG Park where the festival has been held since its 2018 inception 528 Houston Police Department officers provided security with an additional 755 private security members from Live Nation according to Hidalgo.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said that Live Nation planned to hand over video footage from the event and that officials are also relying on interviews with Scott’s team and witnesses at the concert to piece together what may have led to the deadly crowd surge.

Astroworld witnesses: What fans experienced during the festival tragedy

Live Nation released a statement pledging to support investigations: ""Heartbroken for those lost and impacted at Astroworld last night. We will continue working to provide as much information and assistance as possible to the local authorities as they investigate the situation.""

In 2019 prior to the pandemic shutting down the live music industry Live Nation estimated about 98 million fans attended their shows worldwide.

Why was Live Nation previously sued or cited?

► In 2019 the company was fined $5350 for an accident a year earlier in which an employee walking near a staging area was struck in the head by a six-foot metal post.

► Separately Live Nation Entertainment and singer Gwen Stefani were sued in federal court by Lisa Keri Stricklin for injuries she suffered during Stefani’s July 23 2016 concert at the PNC Pavilion in Charlotte North Carolina.

According to the court complaint concert patrons were initially seated in a reserved section and lawn seats. During the concert Stefani made an impromptu announcement that patrons in the lawn seats could move to the reserve section and “fill in anywhere you like.”

“This announcement created a stampede of patrons … with many patrons knocking over and breaching the security barricades” the lawsuit alleged.

Stricklin alleged that she was “trampled by the rush of patrons” resulting in severe physical injuries including a broken leg.

Attorneys for all parties in the lawsuit signed a stipulation of dismissal on March 12 2019 a move that typically signals an out-of-court settlement that ends a case.

► Live Nation was penalized $4250 in a settlement for a 2011 accident in which an employee working as a rigger had a finger crushed while removing a cable. The finger was later amputated.

► In 2020 tour manager and sound engineer Jared Jackson sued Live Nation and several other defendants for negligence alleging he was injured in an onstage fall after he warned of ""unsafe"" conditions at the 2017 Paradiso Festival at the Gorge Amphitheatre in George Washington where he was hired to work for some of the artists on the bill.

During the performance Jackson ""fell through an eight-foot by eight-foot gap in the stage which was covered with decorative camouflage netting"" according to his lawsuit. ""(Jackson) fell approximately 12 feet suffering severe injuries to his legs and body.""

He asserts his medical bills have reached $230000 and his loss of income and earning capacity topped $100000.

""The chaotic nature of such large events creates great risk"" Jason Kafoury told USA TODAY. He's an Oregon lawyer who is one of Jackson's attorneys. ""Live Nation’s history shows its focus on profits over public safety. Ensuring accountability through the civil jury system is essential.""

USA TODAY has reached out to Jackson's lawyers and to lawyers for Live Nation.

Manuel Souza who was in attendance filed a petition Saturday in Harris County District Court claiming that Scott ScoreMore and Live Nation were grossly negligent which led to the ""predictable and preventable tragedy"" that left him injured according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.

EW has reached out to representatives for Scott Live Nation and Drake for comment.

In the complaint Souza alleges that organizers failed to properly plan and conduct the concert in a safe manner instead focusing on profits.

""They consciously ignored the extreme risks of harm to concertgoers and in some cases actively encouraged and fomented dangerous behaviors"" Souza alleges in the petition.

Souza who is represented by attorney Steve Kherkher of the Houston firm Kherkher Garcia LLP is asking for at least $1 million in damages.

A second lawsuit asking for $1 million in damages has been filed by attendee Kristian Paredes according to the Daily Mail. This suit names Drake and Harris County Sports and Convention Corporate alongside Scott and Live Nation citing negligence and alleging that the performers helped incite the crowd.

Paredes 23 was ""severely injured"" in the melee according to the complaint. The petition alleges that the chaos spiraled out of control as Scott and Drake performed and that the security guards hired by Live Nation ignored the concertgoers begging for help.

Texas personal injury attorney Thomas J. Henry represents Paredes.

The eight Astroworld concert victims who ranged in age from 14 to 27 were among the crowd of 50000 in attendance on Friday when a crush of people stormed the stage at NRG Stadium. About 25 people were also taken to local hospitals.

Scott addressed the incident in a statement released Saturday morning offering his cooperation to the Houston Police Department. ""I'm absolutely devastated by what took place last night. My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival"" he wrote on Twitter.

He later spoke about the evening on his Instagram Story saying that he's ""working right now to identify the families to assist them through this tough time."" He added ""My fans really mean the world to me and I always want to leave them with a positive experience.""

Kylie Jenner Scott's partner offered condolences to all the families writing on an Instagram live story that she and Travis are ""broken and devastated."" She continued writing ""I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing.""

Much of the reporting on the incident has centered on the event's safety measures as well as on Scott's apparent failure to stop the show when people began getting hurt.

Minor violations were also discovered during inspections at an amphitheater in California in 2017 and at a 2019 state inspection in Washington the Chronicle said citing OSHA reports.

According to an October 2018 OSHA report ""an employee was walking near a staging area and was struck in his head by a 6-foot length of steel metal post when it was tipped over"" on September 27 2018. The worker was hospitalized for bruising and lacerations in his head the report states.

The company was also sued by a Gwen Stefani concert attendee who broke her leg during a ""stampede"" at a 2016 event in North Carolina. In a 2018 report by Billboard a federal judge cleared Live Nation in the suit but ruled the singer could be held liable for the incident which caused the fan's injury.

Representatives for Live Nation did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.

Paredes is now seeking over $1million for his bodily injuries some of which he claims is permanent as well as to cover medical expenses.

Scott who said he was 'devastated' about the deaths and couldn't 'imagine anything like this happening' has been convicted twice for encouraging fans to jump security barriers and rush the stage at previous concerts.

Rappers Travis Scott and Drake are being sued for over a million dollars by a man who claims he was left 'severely injured' in the crowd

Kristian Paredes 23 from Austin Texas filed the complaint obtained by DailyMail.com Sunday

According to the complaint Drake 'came on stage alongside Travis Scott and helped incite the crowd.' He accuses Drake of continuing to perform with Travis Scott 'as the crowd became out of control' and ' while the crowd mayhem continued'

Paredes says he was at the front of the general admission section with just a metal barrier separating him from the VIP Section.

He says he felt an 'immediate push' as the countdown to Travis Scott's performance ended and he entered the stage around 9pm.

Texas attorney Thomas J. Henry who is representing Paredes said 'There is no excuse for the events that unfolded at NRG stadium on Friday night'

'The crowd became chaotic and a stampede began leaving eight dead and dozens including Kristian Paredes severely injured' the filing states.

'Many begged security guards hired by Live Nation Entertainment for help but were ignored' it says.

Paredes says in the lawsuit that the injuries and deaths are due to the 'negligence carelessness and recklessness' of the 'defendants their agents servants and employees in the ownership management maintenance operation supervision and the control of the subject premises.'

He is seeking a trial by jury.

Texas attorney Thomas J. Henry who is representing Paredes said 'There is no excuse for the events that unfolded at NRG stadium on Friday night.

'There is every indication that the performers organizers and venue were not only aware of the hectic crowd but also that injuries and potential deaths may have occurred. Still they decided to put profits over their attendees and allowed the deadly show to go on.

'Live musical performances are meant to inspire catharsis not tragedy. Many of these concert-goers were looking forward to this event for months and they deserved a safe environment in which to have fun and enjoy the evening. Instead their night was one of fear injury and death.'

Scenes from the tragic night have unfolded on social media showing concert goers unconscious while the rapper continued his performance.

Paredes says in the lawsuit that the injuries and deaths are due to the 'negligence carelessness and recklessness' of the 'defendants their agents servants and employees in the ownership management maintenance operation supervision and the control of the subject premises'

Video circulating on Twitter shows fans begging the rapper to stop performing and chanting 'stop the show' as concertgoers were being knocked down and crushed by other attendees.

'Fans were recording the concert and people doing CPR. Fans were yelling at the stage crew around us saying stop the concert people are dying. No one listened' ICU nurse and concert attendee Madeline Eskins told Rolling Stone.

'It was definitely overcrowded. It was insane honestly. I knew it was just way too crowded – it just got worse and worse as I got closer to Travis Scott performing it got more crowded more crowded more crowded.'

She also shared that although they are not to blame for the tragedy the event's medical staff were apparently unprepared and inexperienced.

'Some of these medical staff had little to no experience with CPR - didn't know how to check a pulse carotid or femoral' Eskins shared on Instagram.

'Compressions were being done without a pulse check so ppl who had a pulse were getting CPR but meanwhile there was not enough people to rotate out doing compressions on individuals that were actually pulseless. The medical staff didn't have the tools to do their jobs and despite the crowd around us trying to get someone to stop the concert they just kept going even though Travis acknowledged that someone in the crowed needed an ambulance.'

Afterwards the rapper was seen sobbing. A source close to him told Page Six that he had 'no idea what was going on he was on stage performing'.

'He's beside himself I've never heard him like that. He was in tears' the source added.

Social media video shows fans begging Travis Scott to stop his Astroworld Festival Friday night during the crowd surge that left at least eight death and hundreds injured. The crowd chanted 'stop the show' as concertgoers were being knocked down and crushed by other attendees

Rapper Travis Scott continued to perform his 75-minute set at Astroworld on Friday night as eight people were killed and hundreds injured in a crowd surge

Friday's deaths raised eyebrows over footage showing multiple incidents of crowds stampeding towards Scott at prior performances at Lollapalooza in Chicago in 2015 and at an outdoor venue in Arkansas in 2017. Both incidents resulted in misdemeanor convictions for Scott.

Kyle Green 27 was left partially paralyzed at a Travis Scott show after Scott encouraged another fan to jump off a balcony. He says Friday's deaths could have been avoided 'had Travis learned his lesson'

A fan who was paralyzed after falling from a balcony during a Scott concert in 2017 has blasted the singer for putting fans' safety at risk.

A lawyer for Kyle Green a 27-year-old who was injured at Scott's April 2017 concert at Terminal 5 in New York City says that Green was 'devastated and heartbroken' for the families of the eight people who died at Scott's Friday night concert.

Green says he was forced over the edge of a balcony at the venue which he called 'severely crowded.' He broke several bones and vertebrae and can only walk with a 'significant significant disability.'

In a statement to DailyMail.com Green's attorney Howard Hershenhorn said that Scott's security picked Green up 'like a sack of potatoes' instead of 'putting him in a neck brace and on the backboard.'

'He’s even more incensed by the fact that it could have been avoided had Travis learned his lesson in the past and changed his attitude about inciting people to behave in such a reckless manner' Hershenhorn told Rolling Stone.

At the 2017 show Scott had encouraged another fan to jump off the balcony.

'I see you but are you gonna do it?' Scott asked. 'They gonna catch you. Don't be scared. Don’t be scared!'

NYC 2017: Green ended up partially paralyzed after cracking several vertebrae when rowdy fans rushed the balcony of Terminal 5 in New York in May 2017. Scott egged one fan to jump. In video of the incident one concertgoer can be heard saying 'I don't wanna die in here.'

CHICAGO 2015: Scott pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct after his fans jumped a security barricade at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago

ARKANSAS 2017: Scott encouraged fans to go past security and rush the stage at a May 2017 show in Arkansas. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct the next year

In video of the incident one fan can be heard saying 'I don't wanna die in here.'

Green sued Scott his manager concert promoter Bowery Presents and a security company six months after the incident while he was still confined to a wheelchair. The case is pending.

In August 2015 the 29-year-old who is dating Kylie Jenner pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct after his fans jumped a security barricade at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago.

The Office of Emergency Management said at the time: 'The performer played one song and then began telling fans to come over the barricades. Due to the security's quick response the situation was remedied immediately and no fans were injured.

The performer fled the scene but was arrested shortly after according to station WLS.

'All my real ragers jump the barricade right now. Let's go. Come over' he said at the 2015 show as his young fans obliged. 'I want chaos.' Hundreds were seen storming towards the stage although there were no reports of anyone being injured.

In February 2018 he pleaded guilty to another misdemeanor charge - this one for disorderly conduct - after he encouraged his fans to rush the stage and bypass security at a May 2017 concert at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in the city of Rogers.

Scott paid a 7465.31 fine according to KFSM.

Tickets to the two-day Astroworld festival sold out in under an hour in May when Scott announced in a since-deleted tweet: 'We still sneaking the wild ones in'

this hurts to watch... It makes me sick to my stomach. Travis Scott is SICK https://t.co/CgaAPHapBT — ✮⋆˙ (@pinkprintbae) November 6 2021

The Rogers Police Department said several people were injured during the rush and treated on the scene by the fire department and staff from a local hospital.

Weeks before that a fan at a Scott concert in Manhattan says he was carried over the side of a balcony after the rapper asked fans to rush forward and was subsequently paralyzed as a result.

And at Astroworld Festival on Friday witnesses allege Scott continued to perform after eight people were crushed to death - including two victims aged just 14 and 16 - in what one witness described as a 'floor of bodies'.

Although he completed his 75-minute performance at one point Scott was filmed calling for help. In another video he stood on a platform with his microphone while chaos unfolded beneath him.

Approximately 50000 people attended the sold-out Astroworld event at Houston's NRG Park. Witnesses said the chaos broke out after Scott took the stage to perform.

'Everything was normal up until when Travis posted the time he was going to get onstage' attendee Donovon Davis 22 of Houston said. 'That's when it just got wild.'

'The crowd was moving so violently that people fell on top of us and when they fell people fell on top of them. There was layers and layers and layers of people falling.'

Davis continued: 'I turned to pick him up and I could hear him screaming for help. The music hadn't started yet. And then the crowd just moved me and I saw a wave of people just walk over him.'

Medics are seen transporting patients as they conduct CPR at Friday's festival

Other videos from the night showed distraught fans begging concert staff to halt the performance and help people escape the surge.

'People are f***ing dying I want to save somebody's life' a man said as he climbed on a platform where a cameraman was filming the performance.

'That's somebody's kid! I want to save them!' he screamed - but to no avail.'

Another clip showed the same man climbing up towards the cameraman joined by a woman pleading with the staff member to stop the concert.

Although inaudible the cameraman was evidently trying to shoo the revelers off the platform and back into the crowd.

In yet another graphic video an unconscious young man was surrounded by Houston police officers who guided him onto the ground. They rolled the man onto his side while shining lights into his eyes.

Police investigating the deadly crush say a crazed man injected at least one person with opioids during the chaos.

Houston Chief of Police Troy Finner made the shocking claim at a press conference Saturday after hours of rumors about the Astroworld Fest tragedy and Mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner revealed the victims were aged between 14 and 27.

'One of the narratives was that some individual was injecting other people with drugs. We do have a report of a security officer according to the medical staff that was out and treated him last night' Houston Chief of Police Troy Finner said at Saturday's conference.

'He was reaching over to restrain or grab a citizen and he felt a prick in his neck.

'He went unconscious they administered Narcan. He was revived and medical staff did notice a prick similar to a prick you would get if somebody was trying to inject' he added.

It is unclear what drug was injected into the security guard although Narcan is used to revive people who've overdosed on opioids including fentanyl.

Around 2pm hundreds of fans stormed the festival's VIP entrance. About seven hours later the surge in front of the main stage killed eight people but the two events appear to be unrelated

The surge happened at 9.15pm and Pena said in a news conference on Saturday afternoon that the 'mass casualty incident' was declared at 9.15pm. Nearly an hour later at 10.10pm the concert producer Live Nation halted the show.

Mayor Turner then confirmed that of the eight who were killed two were under 18 two were 21 two were 23 one was 27 and one victim's age remains unknown.

He also said that 25 people in total were transported to the hospital after the 'tragic event' and 13 are still hospitalized including five that are under the age of 18.

Distressing video showed an unconscious male concertgoer being rushed to a medical assistance area after he passed out in the crush which happened after people surged towards the stage shortly after 9.15pm CST Friday night.

Earlier on Friday hundreds of people were seen stampeding through the event's VIP entrance without being checked sparking fears of overcrowding.

As the chaos unfolded the rapper even appeared to glance in the direction of passed-out fans as the show went on. Scott halted the performance at least once was filmed calling for security to help distressed fans in the front row.

Houston Chief of Police Troy Finner announced during a press conference Saturday (pictured) that a crazed man injected at least one person with opioids during the chaos. It also remains unclear if that incident was connected to the deadly crush that also left 25 in hospital

Mayor Turner said the investigation remains active with the police department's homicide and narcotics team adding that the local government is also speaking with spokespeople from the concert's producer Live Nation Worldwide and Live Nation Entertainment.

'We will probably be at it for quite some time to determine exactly what happened' Turner said.

Houston Police executive assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite who was near the front of the crowd said the surge 'happened all at once'.

'Suddenly we had several people down on the ground experiencing some type of cardiac arrest or some type of medical episode' Satterwhite said. 'And so we immediately started doing CPR and moving people right then.'

Satterwhite said promoters quickly agreed to end the event 'in the interest of public safety'.

In a tweet posted Saturday Scott said he was 'absolutely devastated by what took place last night'.

He pledged to work 'together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need.'

Meanwhile a memorial is growing outside of NRG Park.

People placed letters balloons and bouquets at the gate by the venue.

'I wanted to set it up just cause the lives lost' Matthew who set up the makeshift memorial told KPRC's Rilwan Balogun.

Flowers are placed Saturday outside of the canceled Astroworld festival at NRG Park

'The community right now from everybody that left #AstroWorld is definitely split something to bring us together.'

He continued: 'Even the online community come together just to come over here to put something down.'

Astroworld organizers canceled the rest of the festival scheduled to continue on Saturday.

'Our hearts are with the Astroworld Festival family tonight - especially those we lost and their loved ones' they said on the event's Instagram page. 'We are focused on supporting local officials'.

Travis Scott founded the Astroworld Festival in 2018.

Two Illinois best friends who went to Travis Scott Astroworld concert in Houston to celebrate birthday are identified among eight killed during stampede: Youngest victim is a 14-year-old boy

A pair of best friends from Illinois were the latest victims to be identified in the fatal stampede that killed eight during Travis Scott's Astroworld concert which also took the life of 14-year-old boy.

The identification of the victims continues as it was revealed a 14 year-old boy killed in a crush at the concert was the youngest victim and an unclaimed body photographed and shared by cops has also been identified.

University of Dayton student Franco Patino 21 was attending the event with his best friend 20-year-old Jacob Jurinek. Both were killed in the crush.

Patino was a huge fan of the rapper and travelled from Southern Ohio to Houston for the event with his best friend to celebrate Jurinek's upcoming 21st birthday according to WGN9.

Jurinek better known as Jake attended Southern Illinois University.

Patino was studying engineering and was a member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the Alpha Psi Lambda.

He was also a part of the society's special interest house which he worked with fellow student Andy Prieto to create.

'Andy and I worked together day and night to make this dream come true because we believed it was a necessity to have a house for Hispanics to come together and have a little piece of familiar culture in a predominantly white institution' Patino said in an article about the society on the university's website.

Jurinek is listed as a junior studying journalism on SIU's 'People Finder' site.

'We are brokenhearted to lose a member of the Saluki family Jacob Jurinek and we extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends' SIU Chancellor Austin A. Lane said in a statement Sunday. 'Jacob was a creative intelligent young man with a promising career in journalism and advertising. As we mourn this loss in our community we will keep Jacob's family and friends in our thoughts.'

Jurinek had bought the tickets six months before the show to celebrate his upcoming 21st birthday on November 20. He worked on graphic arts and media as an intern for the athletic department according to the Washington Post.

John Hilgert is the youngest victim of the horrific crush which killed eight people at Friday night's Astroworld Festival in Houston.

He was a ninth grader at Memorial High School and was remembered as a talented baseball player as well as a popular student.

A spokesman for Spring Branch ISD said: 'Our hearts go out to the student's family and to his friends and our staff at Memorial. This is a terrible loss and the entire MHS family is grieving today.

'Please keep the student's family in your thoughts and prayers as they face this tragedy. We will make counselors available to students next week to offer any help and support needed.'

John's baseball coach Justin Higgs also paid a heartfelt tribute on Instagram. He wrote: 'RIP John Hilgert. He got the Call up to the Major Leagues by the Almighty! John made an impact on anyone who met him and they always remembered him. I have memories of John I'll never forget.

'You had to love the kid. No option not too cause he was who he was. He loved the game if baseball. Was a privilege to coach this young man. Many prayers go out to any of his friends teammates and his family… especially Ms. Hilgert.

'One of the nicest human beings I've ever met. John was an Angel the whole time I knew him… impacting others for good and he himself was a legend. The legend of John. Will meet again John. Till then watch over us my friend. Catcher pitcher shortstop great kid. Lived his life to the fullest.'

Hilgert was pictured at the same time as Houston's medical examiner shared a photo of another male victim's body they were unable to identify.

That man's family has since come forward and he has been identified as Axel Acosta 21 KTRK reported.

Acosta was claimed by his father Edgar who had traveled from Washington to attend the concert. His remains have since been claimed from Memorial Medical Hospital by Edgar with Acosta's aunt Cynthia saying it had been the first time he'd ever attended an event.

Acosta turned 21 last month and had been studying computer science at Western Washington University. His dad said he had struggled to file a missing person's report in the wake of the deadly crush because the family lives out of state.

The victims who age between 14 and 27 have been identified as the brother of one of those killed slammed the 'poorly' managed event ran by 'horrible' people.

Danish Baig 27 was one of people who died after a surge at the concert.

'My brother was killed in this horrendous Astroworld event that was managed poorly and supervised by such horrible people' Basil wrote on Facebook.

He commended his late brother for his 'courageous act' and called him a 'beautiful soul.'

Others whose deaths have been confirmed to various news outlets are 16-year-old Brianna Rodriguez and Rodolfo 'Rudy' Peña 23.

Around 2pm hundreds of fans stormed the festival's VIP entrance. About seven hours later the surge in front of the main stage killed eight people but the two events appear to be unrelated

Approximately 50000 people attended the sold-out Astroworld Festival at NRG Park on Friday. Witnesses said the chaos broke out after Scott took the stage to perform.

The surge happened at 9:15 p.m. and the 'mass casualty incident' was declared at that time. Nearly an hour later at 10:10 p.m. the concert producer Live Nation halted the show.

Earlier on Friday hundreds of people were filmed stampeding through a VIP entrance at the Live Nation-organized event sparking fears of overcrowding and poor crowd control.

Scott 29 continued to perform after eight people were crushed to death - including two victims aged just 14 and 16 - in what one witness described as a 'floor of bodies.'

Video circulating on Twitter shows fans chanting 'stop the show' as concertgoers were being knocked down and crushed by other attendees.

Although he completed his 75-minute performance at one point Scott was filmed calling for help. In another video he stood on a platform with his microphone while chaos unfolded beneath him.

As the chaos unfolded the rapper who completed his show even appeared to glance in the direction of passed-out fans as the show went on. Scott halted the performance at least once was filmed calling for security to help distressed fans in the front row.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner revealed during a press conference Saturday that the dead ranged in age from 14 to 27. Their cause of death has not yet been determined.

The project that will be carried out under the contract will be referred to as advanced raptor enhancement & sustainment (ARES).

According to the Pentagon contract announcement Lockheed will provide necessary supplies and services to sustain and modernize the F-22 Raptor including modernization hardware kit procurement and services such as upgrades enhancements and fixes as well as performance-based logistics services.

Lockheed received the contract after the service completed the F-22 structural repair program earlier this year which has been generating aircraft for the last 14 years.

The deadline for the completion of the ARES work is October 2031. It is worth noting that air force officials previously indicated that the service plans to start phasing out first F-22s in around 2030. It is unclear whether this large contract and the scope of work to be carried out will affect that timeline.

The service has previously said that the retirement of the F-F-22 will be closely linked with the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program which apparently already performed its first flight in 2020.

Speaking to Defense News in May this year Lt. Gen. Clinton Hinote US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy integration and requirements said the F-22 is being treated “as the bridge to the NGAD capability.”

“By about the 2030 timeframe you’re talking about a 40-year-old platform [in the F-22] and it’s just not going to be the right tool for the job especially when we’re talking about defending our friends like Taiwan and Japan and the Philippines against a Chinese threat that grows and grows” Hinote said in the interview.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYnVuZ2Fsb3dlci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNy9zY2llbmNlLWNlbnRlci1ob3N0aW5nLXdyZWF0aC1jZXJlbW9ueS1vbi12ZXRlcmFucy1kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Science Center hosting wreath ceremony on Veteran's Day,"Orlando Science Center will host a wreath-laying ceremony at the Red Tails Monument just outside the café entrance in Loch Haven Park in honor of Veteran’s Day on Thursday November 11.

The Red Tails Monument was installed in November 2013 and was made possible through a partnership with Orlando Science Center and Vision of Flight to honor the Red Tail Pilots of the Tuskegee Airmen – the first African-American Air Corps in World War II.

The ceremony is expected to be brief and will feature remarks by Tom Mirek with Lockheed Martin JoAnn Newman with Orlando Science Center and Michael McKenzie with Vision of Flight. The ceremony will conclude with a moment of science followed by a bugler honoring fallen heroes with a performance of “Taps.”

The ceremony is sponsored by Lockheed Martin and is open for everyone to attend.

In addition to the ceremony Orlando Science Center is offering a special admission rate for veterans and active military now through November 14. The museum is providing free admission to all veterans and active military with valid military ID and 50% off for their attending family.

The F-35 was supposed to fly one month of testing in a highly advanced simulator last December the latest delay since the original goal of 2017. But that was postponed yet again by unresolved technical problems in the ""Joint Simulation Environment” test facility compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. Then the Pentagon’s office of operational testing estimated in January that the exercise would commence midyear or by this December.

Defense Department acquisition legal and testing officials didn’t arrive at a new date when they met last month to review progress of software and verification procedures needed to validate that the simulation of 64 sorties will replicate real-world encounters.

The simulation ""will be executed after the JSE capabilities are sufficiently validated verified and accredited to conduct the mission trials” Pentagon acquisition spokesperson Jessica Maxwell said in a statement. Asked when the Defense Department’s F-35 program office will set a new schedule Laura Seal a spokeswoman said ""we will provide updates when we have them.”

The Pentagon’s test office reiterated in a statement its long-standing view that the simulation is necessary as part of legally required testing before Bethesda Maryland-based Lockheed can proceed with full-rate production. Of a potential fleet of 3000 or more F-35s for the U.S. and international customers 720 already have been delivered. Those may need to be retrofitted based on findings from the tests.

Test teams have completed 89 F-35 in-flight missions according to the testing office and the 64 remaining sorties in the simulator will complete the missions required in the congressional mandated trials."

Every so often Lowe’s runs a deal on certain third party gift cards purchased in-store. They’re running one such deal right now that gives you a $25 Lowe’s eGift card free when buying a $250 Delta gift card.

The Deal

Buy a $250 Delta gift card at Lowe’s and get a $25 Lowe’s eGift card free.

Direct link to claim Lowe’s eGift card.

Key Terms

Offer valid November 4-10 2021.

Code must be claimed by November 24 2021.

Limit 2 per email address.

Quick Thoughts

If you’re in the market for both Delta and Lowe’s gift cards this is a pretty good deal seeing as Delta gift cards don’t go on sale very frequently.

Note that you don’t get the Lowe’s gift card in-store at the same time as the Delta gift card. Instead after purchasing the Delta gift card you complete the form at the link above and you’ll then get the $25 eGift card.

Lowe’s sells two types of Delta gift cards – $250 fixed-value cards and $25-$500 variable load cards. I don’t know if loading $250 of value to a variable load card will work or not so it’s probably safest to buy a $250 fixed-value card if your store has them.

This could be a particularly great offer if you were targeted for the new Lowe’s Amex Offer giving $50 back when spending $250. This Delta offer matches the spend requirement perfectly so you’d get $275 worth of gift cards for a net cost of $200.

CHARLOTTE N.C. — The City of Charlotte celebrated the grand opening of The Ritz at Washington Heights on Saturday as a new public gathering space featuring a performance space and plaza café-style seating public art landscaping and a play area.

Officials say the new space is located at Tate Street and Beatties Ford Road the former site of The Ritz Theater which was demolished in 1971 after sitting vacant for years.

The Ritz theater is known as the last Black movie theater built in Charlotte during segregation according to a news release.

Officials say residents of the Washington Heights neighborhood plan to hold movie nights at the new space to commemorate its historic and cultural significance.

“Today’s announcement is proof that the Corridors of Opportunity program is working to resurrect aspects of history and culture along Beatties Ford Road while gaining support from our private partners” said Charlotte City Council Member Malcolm Graham District 2. “I want to thank Lowe’s for the generous grant that provides the opportunity to build a place for families to gather and enjoy a rebirth of arts and culture in this community.”

Officials say The Ritz at Washington Heights was constructed in three months which is the fastest built City of Charlotte infrastructure project ever.

The project was made possible due to a $200000 grant from Lowe’s 100 Hometowns initiative and a $50000 grant from the city’s Corridors of Opportunity program according to a news release.

Officials say instead of the traditional ribbon-cutting ceremony the inauguration featured sawing a two-by-four.

“We are proud to be part of today’s project as it will benefit so many members within our Charlotte community” said central Charlotte Store Manager Gary McCoy. “This project is part of Lowe’s Centennial celebration and commitment to supporting 100 projects in 100 communities across the nation from community centers and spaces to gardens and food pantries. 100 Hometowns gives Lowe’s an opportunity to demonstrate how we are empowering the possibility of making homes – and communities - better for all now and for the next 100 years.”

Officials say the transformation of the vacant space into an education and entertainment hub is intended to confront and address social economic education and health disparities as well as preserve the area’s history and culture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3JlLmNvbS9uaGwvbmV3cy8yMjE3OTAy0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc2NvcmUuY29tL25obC9uZXdzLzIyMTc5MDIvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: Oilers retire Hall of Fame defenseman Kevin Lowe's No. 4,"The Edmonton Oilers retired Hall of Fame defenseman Kevin Lowe's No. 4 jersey prior to Friday's clash against the New York Rangers.

A six-time Stanley Cup champion and a major component of the Oilers' dynasty era Lowe recorded 431 points over 1254 career NHL games.

Lowe spent his first 13 seasons in Edmonton and won his first five Stanley Cup championships as an Oiler. He notoriously played through a broken wrist and broken ribs en route to Edmonton's Cup victory in 1988.

Lowe also played for the Rangers for four seasons and won his sixth Stanley Cup in the Big Apple. He returned to the Oilers for a second stint in 1996 and played one full campaign before retiring in 1998.

During the festivities the Oilers also shared a tribute video for their first-ever draft pick.

After hanging up his skates Lowe stuck around with Edmonton and has since served as an assistant coach head coach general manager and president of hockey operations. He's currently the team's alternate governor.

The 62-year-old was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the Class of 2020. However the ceremony was postponed until Nov. 15 of this year due to the pandemic.

Lowe is the eighth Oiler in franchise history to have his number retired."

Un gruppo molto variegato per formazione e professionalità: dai turnisti ai tecnici di laboratori dai dottori in chimica agli ingegneri.

“Proprio nello scorso mese di ottobre si è conclusa con successo la seconda edizione dell’Operator Academy ed è partita la terza edizione” dichiara Monica Bellagamba HR Area Manufacturing del sito di Ferrara. “Nel corso di quest’anno sono stati coinvolti 26 giovani provenienti da varie regioni d’Italia (Emilia Romagna Puglia e Sicilia) e siamo molto soddisfatti dell’interesse dimostrato finora per questo percorso professionale. Inoltre” conclude Bellagamba “il 30% dei giovani della prima edizione è già stato assunto a tempo indeterminato all’interno delle nostre strutture produttive.”

I giovani diplomati sono stati selezionati sia grazie ai progetti in essere con gli istituti tecnici del territorio (ex-Scuola Alternanza Lavoro) sia ai progetti interni come per esempio l’Operator Academy l’Accademia di Formazione di LyondellBasell dedicata ai diplomati con studi di perito chimico meccanico e/o elettronico che intendono intraprendere la carriera tecnica in azienda.

Oltre ai tecnici e ai giovani dell’Accademia nell’area delle attività produttive sono stati assunti altri 23 professionisti tra operatori turnisti di impianto di produzione polimeri e catalizzatori e ingegneri (chimici elettrici sicurezza processo).

La società ha assunto anche 25 nuove figure a tempo indeterminato a supporto del Centro Ricerche Giulio Natta dagli operatori agli ingegneri oltre ai ricercatori.

“Queste nuove assunzioni sono una chiara prova che la ricerca e l’innovazione sono elementi essenziali per un’azienda che guarda al futuro” sostiene Gabriella Bazzana HR Ricerca e Sviluppo di Ferrara. “Non è un caso che alcune assunzioni siano state effettuate per impiegare i giovani a lavorare sul nuovo impianto pilota MoReTec la nuova tecnologia di riciclo molecolare di LyondellBasell. Questa tecnologia trasforma i rifiuti di plastica in materia prima necessaria per produrre della nuova plastica senza utilizzare così la materia prima derivante fossile nel rispetto della vera economia circolare.”

L’Operator Academy è una scuola post diploma della durata di 12 mesi durante i quali i neo-assunti effettuano un primo periodo di formazione in aula; subito dopo si trovano in campo prima con un periodo di affiancamento e successivamente in maniera graduale aumentando l’autonomia (in campo). Un’esperienza che serve da trampolino di lancio e che permette a giovani diplomati di tuffarsi letteralmente dalla scuola al mondo del lavoro con un contratto a tempo determinato.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NEOM

Malcolm Aw said he pulled out of a Neom contract because of alleged Saudi human rights abuses.

The CEO of Solar Water told BI that he had planned to build solar desalination plants.

Human rights campaigners say tribe members are being forcibly evicted to make way for the megacity.

A green energy founder pulled out of a $100 million Neom contract after he realized that the Saudis were bulldozing villages to make way for the megacity.

Malcolm Aw the CEO and founder of Solar Water told Business Insider that he initially got involved with Neom to help realize its ambitions as a pioneering green energy ""eco-city.""

Neom is the centerpiece of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 project to diversify the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels and transform it into a luxury tourism destination and innovation hub.

However Aw said he was so appalled at reports of human rights abuses that he canceled the Neom contract in 2022 despite having already built some of his desalination plants there.

""They just they bulldoze their way right through villages and everything which is just unbelievable"" said Aw.

Aw spoke to BI after BBC News reported that an exiled Saudi colonel said Saudi Arabia authorized the use of lethal force to clear the way for its Neom desert megacity.

Col Rabih Alenezi said he was ordered to evict people living on the land to make way for a part of the project called The Line . The area was mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe.

The BBC said it was not able to independently verify Alenezi's comments about lethal force.

However satellite images analyzed by the BBC showed three villages including schools and hospitals were destroyed to make way for Neom.

One of the villagers Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti was later reportedly killed by Saudi authorities said the UN.

""What it tried to do is turn the whole province into Dubai or Qatar or something but in doing so they are clearing the people who have been there for years out of the area"" said Aw.

""These people could be such a contribution to this whole development. You know the villages have all been removed.""







Aw who is a descendant of Tiger Balm founder Aw Boon Haw told BI that he had initially been drawn to work on the Neom project because of its commitment to green energy and ecology.

Aw's company uses solar energy for desalination while most desalination plants burn fossil fuels and have been found to pollute oceans. Neom had offered Aw's company Solar Water $100m for exclusive rights to use his technology.

Neom's planners say they want to be an""eco-city"" with the signature project ""The Line"" — a vertical mirrored skyscraper cutting through the desert — running on 100% renewable energy and 95% of the land preserved for nature. They claim to be committed to ""respecting existing communities and cultural heritage within our region.""

But Aw believes the promises are not being fulfilled and planners are performing a U-turn on their original vision for the city.

""What they're doing is not ethical and what they're doing is they're creating an exclusivity to house wealthy people in a wealthy touristic area. But that wasn't the original idea. The idea was to develop a green scenario"" he said.

""The whole idea we came in is to make the place green and for the people the local people the indigenous who have been there for ages for yonks to be able to share into development"" said Aw. ""But then they change course. Suddenly they are totally different from what we expect to do and in doing so they have done a lot of damage.""

Neom declined to comment on Aw's claims. The Saudi embassy in the UK did not respond to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia has been trying to quell public criticism about its Vision 2030 plans .

Last year BI reported that the crackdown extended to those criticizing the evictions on social media with Fatima al-Shawarbi sentenced to 30 years in prison for speaking out.

The project has been beset by problems in recent months with costs spiraling to an estimated $1 trillion and key projects delayed or cut back. In April Bloomberg reported that Saudi officials were reducing the number of people expected to be living in Neom from around one million to 300000 by 2030. The report also said the length of The Line could be cut from around 100 miles to one mile.

Aw urged planners to stand by their original ethical and ecological vision.

""You know we have the technology to solve the [green energy] problem that people are complaining about today. Absolutely. Absolutely. But there's just not the vision or the ethical commitment"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM4OTIvdmVyaXpvbi10bW9iaWxlLWF0dC11bmxpbWl0ZWQtcGxhbi1mcmVlLXBob25lLW9mZmVycy1maW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile's “unlimited” plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist,"Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile will pay a combined $10.22 million to a group of states to settle claims that the carriers lied to customers about their “unlimited” plans and “free” phone offers. The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Orbits $52M-$55M Opening – Friday PM Box Office Update,"FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Knock on wood but this summer release looks to be meeting its tracking projections. Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

5.) Godzilla x Kong (WB/Leg) 2531 theaters Fri $700K 3-day $3M -34% Total $192.3M/Wk 7

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening.

Sales at the celebrity chef’s dining establishments which range from his Michelin-starred flagship Restaurant Gordon Ramsay to Street Burger rose by 21% to £95.6m in the year to 27 August. The group took on 290 more staff after a tough time during the pandemic lockdowns.

However pre-tax losses rose to £3.4m from £1.05m a year before after £4.9m of one-off costs the vast majority of which related to pre-opening costs for new restaurants including a Lucky Cat outlet in Manchester a Bread Street Kitchen outlet in Battersea power station and a Street Pizza outlet in Edinburgh.

Ramsay also bought the Shoreditch eatery Pizza East. Underlying earnings excluding one-off costs tax and write-downs rose to £8.3m from £6.2m.

While losses worsened during the year they still mark a turnaround from the pandemic which brought Ramsay’s business operations to a halt and forcing him to cut almost 300 jobs amid £12m in losses.

Ramsay said: “It’s been a really hard-fought year but at the same time an exciting year and in tough times it amazes me how strong and vibrant our industry is. It’s challenging out there and businesses are battling to stay afloat rising costs rent and food costs multiple strikes. It’s a battle.

“However I genuinely don’t think there’s been a year since I opened my first restaurant in 1998 where there has been so much passion and vibrancy in our industry.

“People still want to go out break bread and have a good time together. We’ve still got something wonderful to celebrate and I truly believe the industry has never been so exciting.”

Ramsay who opened his first solo venture Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea in 1998 said he was on track to surpass £100m of sales this year.

He intends to opens five new restaurants within London’s new skyscraper 22 Bishopsgate – including Lucky Cat and its roof terrace on level 60 making it the capital’s highest restaurant.

The development will also include an outpost of Bread Street Kitchen and Bar and a 14-seat chef’s table from Restaurant Gordon Ramsay the chef’s Michelin-starred Chelsea venue and the Gordon Ramsay Academy where culinary enthusiasts can hone their skills.

Ramsay said: “This is more than just a new opening – it’s a significant milestone for our business. We’re not only launching the highest culinary experiences in London but also creating a vibrant culinary hub at the incredible 22 Bishopsgate.”

The Blueprint board made up of all 12 city and county commissioners approved $10 million for major renovations to FAMU's football stadium in 2020. At the time the stadium was in such disrepair it was unclear whether home games would be played there in the 2021 season.

Last year FAMU asked Blueprint for $15 million more for Bragg improvements. The board in February denied the university's request for immediate funding but voted to explore the use of economic development funds rather than infrastructure dollars for the project.

Robinson in a Monday letter to Leon County Commissioner Carolyn Cummings who chairs the Blueprint board thanked the agency for the $10 million and consideration of the additional $15 million.

""However at this time we are withdrawing our request for additional assistance from the Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency for Bragg Memorial Stadium"" Robinson wrote in the letter obtained by the Democrat. ""We look forward to continuing to work with you the Blueprint Board of Directors and Blueprint staff in other ways going forward.""

The letter was dated two days after FAMU's spring graduation ceremony and surprise announcement of the purported nine-figure stock contribution from Gregory Gerami CEO of Batterson Farms Corp a little-known hemp company based in Austin Texas. The gift would have been the biggest ever for FAMU or any historically Black college or university.

But on Thursday FAMU put Gerami's donation on hold amid mounting questions about it. Gerami has a history of philanthropic overtures to other universities including Coastal Carolina University and the University of Texas at Austin that never materialized according to reporting by the Myrtle Beach Sun News.

It's unclear whether FAMU's decision to backtrack on its most recent Blueprint request was directly related to Gerami's would-be donation. The gift agreement between Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust stipulated that at least $100 million would go toward FAMU athletics.

A FAMU spokesperson was not available for comment on late Thursday on whether the now-paused donation would prompt the university to reconsider its abandoned request for $15 million in Blueprint funds.

An accelerated shift to digital transactions in all areas of the economy has been a lasting legacy of the coronavirus pandemic — and the trading of US bonds has proved no exception.

Electronic trading had already been transforming the US government bond market in the decade that followed the global financial crisis. Tougher capital rules for banks after 2008 opened up one of Wall Street’s more exclusive markets to other computer-orientated dealers known as principal trading firms. This growing reliance on technology steadily boosted the use of automatic prices — those that are provided and constantly updated through algorithms — and in turn cemented the role of electronic platforms operated by MarketAxess and Tradeweb.

But it took the Covid crisis to up the rate of change. “More platforms are aggregating liquidity and the pace has accelerated since the pandemic” says Josh Barrickman head of bond indexing at Vanguard.

Where the pandemic has truly moved the digital needle is in the corporate bond market — where companies sell vast amounts of their debt to large institutional investors such as BlackRock Fidelity and Vanguard.

Electronic transactions in high quality corporate bonds are now accounting for 40 per cent of the total — up from less than 30 per cent in early 2020 and from just one-tenth in 2011 according to Greenwich Associates a London-based market research company. Around 60 per cent of US government bond trading has been electronic for several years.

“The response to the pandemic has pulled the future forward by five years for the bond market” says Dan Veiner global head of fixed income trading at BlackRock. “There has been a surge in electronic trading and the platforms are . . . encouraging more all-to-all trading” — the process whereby both dealers and investors provide prices in one venue and transact.

The response to the pandemic has pulled the future forward by five years for the bond market

This growth in electronic trading of corporate bonds has been nurtured by two important developments: more accurate price data; and strong growth in the number of exchange traded funds that track various bond indices.

“Data has become more reliable and this has improved the quality of prices seen in the market” says Veiner. “More dealers and investors are using algos or automatic trading systems to transact so-called ‘social size’ trades of up to $5m in the more liquid investment-grade bonds.”

At the height of the pandemic market rout in March 2020 the US Federal Reserve announced that it would start buying bond ETFs. That helped stem panic selling in corporate debt as it encouraged investors to sit in or buy. With the Fed’s support investors have since pumped record amounts of money into bond ETFs over the past year helping create a much deeper market for trading bonds on electronic platforms.

Strong investor demand for fixed income ETFs helps drive greater electronic trading in the corporate bonds that are bundled together in the index tracking instruments. “We are seeing a tighter integration with ETFs [and bond prices] on trading desks” explains Barrickman.

One example of the resulting changes in the corporate bond market is how large baskets of bonds are being quickly priced and traded using electronic platforms. Better data and the ability to find more prices through ETFs mean that hundreds of bonds can be electronically priced at the same time.

So-called portfolio trades have gained in popularity as they allow investors to buy or to sell large baskets of bonds particularly if many of the holdings are available in an existing ETF. Dealers and other market makers are more willing to price these baskets of bonds if they can use the ETFs to help them hedge risk and then unwind their exposure over time.

“Portfolio trades are a balance sheet efficient way for dealers to move large transactions” says Veiner. “Credit algos ETFs and portfolio trading are important tools for efficient risk intermediation.”

As trading in bonds becomes more electronic the question for market participants is whether the shift provides more resilience during bouts of turmoil — when there is typically less price support from dealers.

“While big banks are instrumental in maintaining liquidity the market has become more diverse and what we saw during the pandemic was that electronic systems continued to supply data and [to] function” says Kevin McPartland head of research market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates.

Earlier this year analysts at Pimco also examined the lessons from the market turmoil of March 2020 and concluded that the episode made a case for reducing some of the regulatory constraints on bank balance sheets and “expanding the footprint of all-to-all trading platforms”.

In the past banks with large balance sheets had acted as buyers of last resort when investors took flight and dumped bonds. By holding these positions the big dealers helped stabilise prices and ultimately reaped large gains.

But Pimco concluded that facilitating a more open market with some regulatory relief “could foster additional sources of liquidity less reliance on a handful of banks and lower costs.” Ultimately the report said that in time the use of trading platforms “could also ease markets’ reliance on the Fed as the liquidity provider of last resort.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

This week: Texas toll road traffic rises above pre-pandemic levels; Texas expands CDL testing renewals throughout November; Mexican manufacturer opens global office in Washington; and cross-border trucking insurance firm acquired by Marsh McLennan.

Texas toll road traffic rises above pre-pandemic levels

Traffic levels on the Texas State Highway 130 toll road are surging to pre-pandemic levels and higher according to the company that operates the public-private thoroughfare in the Lone Star State.

“We have experienced quite dramatic growth in this post-COVID period. We’re well over our pre-COVID volumes on the road” Doug Wilson CEO of SH 130 Concession Co. told FreightWaves.

State Highway 130 runs 91 miles through central Texas. SH 130 Concession operates a private toll road that runs along a 41-mile stretch of the highway from just southeast of Austin south to Seguin a town about 30 miles east of San Antonio.

During the period from March through October of this year the SH 130 Concession Co. roadway saw more than 7 million transactions 31% higher than the pre-COVID period in 2019. The road is owned by the state which has a lease agreement with SH 130 Concession until 2062.

Wilson attributes the surging traffic along the toll road to commercial and residential growth in the region along with businesses reopening and slowly returning to normal.

“Traffic on any toll road is very location specific and our location is seeing dramatic growth. We’re exceeding our pre-COVID levels because of this growth in economic activity and because this is a major corridor for freight traffic which has been very strong” Wilson said.





The base toll rate for passenger vehicles is $7.84 with an electronic tag to travel the entire length of the toll road. The base toll rate for an 18-wheeler with one trailer is $31.40 with an electronic toll tag.

Earlier this year SH 130 Concessions teamed up with the Texas Trucking Association (TXTA) to persuade more trucking companies to use the toll road through a program of rebates and incentives.

FreightWaves SONAR platform includes the outbound tender market share index that measures the relative percentage of outbound tender volumes in each market in the U.S. adding up to 100. The Austin market accounted for .32% of the total outbound truckload demand recently.

Tractor trailer traffic on the tollway has increased annually by double digits year-over-year since 2014. There were about 1.8 million tractor-trailer transactions from March through October 2021 an increase of 37% over the comparable pre-COVID period in 2019.

James Lovett director of public affairs for SH 130 Concession Co. said they have good relationships with both TXTA and the Laredo Motor Carriers Association.

“The program has performed well and we’re getting good feedback.” Lovett said. “Through our partnerships with great groups like TXTA and the LMCA we’re able to connect directly with carriers to analyze their traffic movements through the corridor and develop a program that fits.”

Wilson said they are exploring options to continue the incentive program for carriers examining whether they need to tweak it to entice more trucking companies while maximizing revenue.

“This transportation corridor is changing so fast. One of the reasons SH 130 is here is to try to get trucks off I-35” Wilson said. “We would love to understand where the pricing sensitivities and the critical pricing points are for these trucking companies.”





The southern portion of the SH 130 toll road which opened in 2012 at a construction cost of $1.35 billion was initially touted as a way to alleviate gridlock on Interstate 35 through Austin. It was initially built under a public-private partnership agreement between Madrid Spain-based Ferrovial Construction and San Antonio- based Zachry Construction.

I-35 through Austin has some of the worst congestion in the nation according to a recent study by the American Transportation Research Institute. The stretch was ranked 15th in the nation for traffic snarls.

Truck drivers were delayed more than 26 million hours along I-35 in Austin wasting 44 million gallons of fuel costing them $1.5 billion during 2019 according to a study from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.

For the first several years traffic revenues failed to live up to expectations. The original SH 130

Concession Co. filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2016. The bankruptcy plan approved in 2017 created a new holding company granting bondholders ownership of the company while keeping its existing agreement with TxDOT in place.

Today the toll road is finally meeting the expectations many had for it.

“Our traffic is weighted toward commercial traffic with more than 25% of our transactions in heavy vehicles” Wilson said. “This is not surprising because our roadway is a fast safe and reliable alternative to the southern sections of I-35 for truck traffic.”

The SH 130 toll road is part of a corridor that is fast becoming a magnet for commercial and industrial activity including the $1 billion Tesla Gigafactory being built just outside of Austin. The Tesla factory which will produce electric vehicles is scheduled to be finished in 2022.

Over the past year more than $400 million in business investment in the region has created more than 1400 direct jobs — many of them in transportation and logistics according to the Greater San Marcos Partnership an economic development organization based in San Marcos Texas about 12 miles from the toll road.

“Growth between Austin and San Antonio and construction on I-35 are producing more and more congestion on I-35 making SH 130 a very attractive alternative. These factors should continue and the natural path for additional growth in the corridor is eastward in the direction of SH 130” Wilson said. “We expect much greater commercial commuter and local traffic where we have the roadway capacity ready. We believe this will keep our strong traffic growth going for many years.”

Texas expands CDL testing renewals throughout November

Texas is expanding CDL testing to six days a week for the month of November in response to a truck driver shortage that has contributed to supply chain issues according to a release.

The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) has added additional Saturday appointments at select CDL offices for customers needing to apply renew replace or upgrade their Texas CDLs.

Tests and other CDL services are normally only available Monday through Friday in Texas. Participating driver license offices will offer a limited number of appointments on Saturdays throughout November.

“We’ve all seen reports or personally felt the impact of the severe strain our supply chain is currently facing” said Steven McCraw DPS director. “By adding CDL services at select offices we can get more qualified commercial drivers out on the roads to move more goods.”

Mexican manufacturer opens global office in Washington

Deacero one of Mexico’s largest steel wire producers recently opened a global trade and corporate affairs office in Washington.

“This is where decisions are made that affect our company its workers and its customers — not only in the U.S but also in Mexico and in other international markets where we do business” said Raul Gutierrez CEO of Deacero. “We want to stay informed about those decisions and be part of the public dialogue that shapes them. The new office will give us the direct presence needed to do this well.”

Monterrey Mexico-based Deacero manufactures steel wires and reinforcing steel. The company has 8000 employees in 20 countries including recycling centers steel mills steel wire facilities and an R&D center.

Cross-border trucking insurance firm acquired by Marsh McLennan

Irving Texas-based Southwest Truck Insurance has been acquired by the Marsh McLennan Agency (MMA).

“CEOs are recognizing the impact that well-being can have on business continuity safety employee performance the client experience reputation and ultimately the bottom line. This is reflected in our research which shows the importance of urgently tackling people-related risks.”

People-related exposures such as health and safety governance and digitization have been rapidly rising up risk registers and are gaining increased board attention. In part this trend has been accelerated as the pandemic clearly showed that threats to the health and well-being of the workforce threaten the overall resilience and success of a business.

Building business resilience by mitigating people-related risks

By hearing first hand from 744 risk and 637 HR professionals across the globe we learned which people risks will have the most severe impacts and the barriers preventing firms from mitigating them.

Top threats facing organizations

Cybersecurity talent attraction retention and engagement data privacy and workforce exhaustion are the top people-related risks facing workforces today according to risk managers and HR professionals.

Building a risk analysis framework

The 25-people risk framework can help risk management and HR teams articulate in board-level conversations the consequences of not acting now to manage these exposures.

Enterprise risk management meets benefits and reward strategies

The pandemic has put workers’ physical mental social and financial health in the spotlight highlighting exposures which can be managed using a risk management framework approach.

Understanding the barriers

Risk and HR managers alike said the biggest difficulty in managing people-related risks was that their organization lacked skilled resources to understand and address them.

A shared responsibility

We asked risk and HR managers who had ultimate responsibility for 25 people-related exposures. Responses were mixed but risk management HR and senior leadership were consistently among the top three responses.

About the survey

The Managing the People Side of Risk survey was conducted over March and April 2021 with1381 respondents across Asia Europe Latin America and the Caribbean Middle East and Africa North America Pacific and the United Kingdom.

There was a split of 54% risk professionals and 46% HR professionals with participation across a wide range of industries. The respondents also represented a cross-section of employer sizes.

Survey respondents were asked to assess the likelihood of the risk occurring in their organization in the next three years on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing a risk that is not very likely and 5 a risk that is very likely to occur. They also assessed severity of each risk’s impact on the business if it were to occur on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing no impact and 5 a catastrophic impact.

The risk rating score was calculated as a product of the likelihood and severity of the risk occurring.

Respondents were also asked to assess to what extent their organization is currently addressing the risk on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing not at all and 5 to a great extent.

View the current offers here.

Spirit Airlines recently announced the launch of a brand new credit card the Free Spirit® Points Plus Mastercard®. In partnership with Mercury Financial this card – along with the Free Spirit Points Mastercard® which was introduced back in February – will give travelers even more opportunities to earn points to jump-start their next vacation.

There's one main difference between this card and many other credit cards out there: this is an invite-only card offer. That's right you must receive an invitation to apply typically through the mail. If you have received a mailer you'll see a reservation code on the flyer. This is your key to applying for the card.

Assuming you have an invitation let's look at what new benefits cardmembers will receive and how this card differs from the two other existing Spirit credit cards.

The basics

Those eligible to apply can earn 20000 Free Spirit bonus points and a $100 Companion Flight Voucher after making qualifying purchases of $750 and at least one minimum monthly payment within the first day 90 days of account opening. While the card comes with a $79 annual fee it's waived the first year.

Cardmembers will also earn 3x Free Spirit points on eligible Spirit purchases including flights 2x Free Spirit points on dining and grocery purchases and 1x Free Spirit points on all other purchases.

Additionally new cardmembers will receive:

25% rebate on inflight food and beverage purchases

Shortcut boarding/Zone 2 early boarding

Points pooling for individuals and up to eight additional Free Spirit members

$100 Companion Flight Voucher each year after they spend $5000 during the cardmember year

One status qualifying point (SQP) for every $10 spent in purchases

Spirit points will not expire for cardmembers

As with the other Spirit Airlines credit cards one very attractive benefit is the ability to earn status through credit card spending. Spirit requires you to earn 2000 SQPs for Silver and 5000 SQPs for Gold status so earning 1 SQP for every $10 spent is potentially significant. This means you'll earn Silver status after making $20000 in annual charges and Gold status with $50000 in charges. While that's a lot of spending the SQPs you earn from spending also can be combined with SQPs you earn by flying Spirit thus reducing the needed credit card spend to earn the respective status levels.

Earning status on Spirit Airlines can save you a decent amount of money over the year. Spirit charges for almost everything — including onboard beverages like soda — but having status means the airline will waive many of the fees that you might otherwise incur. Status will keep your low fare from creeping up in overall price due to all the extra add-ons.

Comparing the Spirit credit cards

The Free Spirit® Points Plus Mastercard® card looks extremely similar to the Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard which also has a $79 annual fee.

The earning rate is precisely the same and the benefits are identical. The main difference is that the welcome offer on the Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard is twice the number of points and that card is not invite-only -- 40000 bonus points plus a $100 companion voucher after making at least $1000 on purchases in the first 90 days of account opening. So even if you didn't get an invitation to apply for the new card you might want to get the older one instead and still come away with a significant points haul.

There are also two no-annual-fee Spirit cards: the Free Spirit Points Mastercard® and the Free Spirit Travel Mastercard. These cards have a slightly lower earning rate as well as fewer benefits. The welcome offers on these two cards are also significantly reduced making the annual fee on the Free Spirit® Points Plus Mastercard® and Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard well worth it at least in the first year.

If you prefer a low-cost airline but Spirit doesn't work for your traveling needs there's also the Frontier Airlines World Mastercard®. This credit card will also help you earn reward points to fly around the U.S. Mexico and select Caribbean islands.

With the same $79 annual fee (waived the first year) it offers many similar benefits such as the ability to pool your Frontier miles the opportunity to earn a $100 voucher and the ability to earn qualifying miles towards elite status. The Frontier card earns 5 miles per dollar spent while flying Frontier 3 miles per dollar on restaurant purchases and 1 mile per dollar on all other purchases. If you fly often the extra miles earned can add up quite quickly with Frontier.

Additionally the Frontier Airlines World Mastercard® has an incredibly high welcome offer where you can earn up to 60000 bonus miles — 40000 bonus miles after spending $500 on purchases and paying the annual fee in full both within the first 90 days then an additional 20000 bonus miles after spending $2000 on purchases within the first six months.

Bottom line

If you are a frequent Spirit flyer — or even if you only travel a few times a year — the Free Spirit® Points Plus Mastercard® is one to consider if you receive an invite. Still you'll earn twice as many miles from the welcome bonus with the Free Spirit Travel More World Elite Mastercard as compared to the invite-only Free Spirit Points Plus Mastercard so you might want to go for that card instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzA3L2RvLXZpc2EtYW5kLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtaGF2ZS10by1mZWFyLWZpbnRlY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Do Visa and Mastercard Have to Fear From Fintech?,"The two payments giants deliver third-quarter earnings and Robinhood stock takes a tumble.

Jason Moser: It's Monday November 1st. I am your host Jason Moser and on today's Financials Show we're digging into the latest earnings reports for Visa Mastercard and Robinhood. Joining me this week it's Jason Hall. Jason good to see you.

Jason Hall: Jason Moser it is a pleasure to be on with you.

Jason Moser: We don't get to do this often enough. I'm glad we have a plethora of material to get through. We could probably talk about this stuff for a lot more time than we were allowed to today. Let's just jump right in.

Jason Hall: Yeah we've got an hour's worth of content and 30 minutes to get it done.

Jason Moser: Easily we're in the middle of earnings season of course. A lot of companies reporting last week and this week. Last week we had a few of our favorites to cover reporting. We're going to start the show this week with Mastercard. Mastercard I think everybody is very familiar with the brand and with generally speaking what they do. Not the greatest week. They had a tough week last week shares down about six and a half percent. It felt like a good report that in fact the market received it with cautious optimism. What are your takeaways from Mastercard's recent report there?

Jason Hall: Yeah I think so too. Jason if you look at the stock chart to think about what's going on with the stock price versus what's happening out here in the actual world it feels like Mastercard and Visa the two we're going to talk about got tied up in that reopening trade. The result that we've seen over the year because that was the big talk at the beginning of the year and early in the winter. The results I guess just haven't met expectations. I think maybe I'm taking a look at Mastercard. You go back into the second quarter and it reports all of these different metrics or different parts of its business. In general we think about the e-commerce stuff so transactions card-not-present. That's largely people ordering stuff online has just exploded and that's driven their number of transactions above 2019 levels. That's another thing that we're doing that's helpful is they're not just giving us the comps to last year because we know last year was bizarre land and not representative of the kind of business that this normally is. We get those 2019 comps and I could look at switched volume you look at switched transactions 127 percent in the second quarter 131 percent in the third quarter and then through October 21st 132 percent. We're seeing that continued acceleration. But then you look at their international travel number that cross-border volume and it was still 77 percent of 2019 levels right?

Jason Moser: Yeah.

Jason Hall: I think it's cautious optimism I think that word is right just caution maybe. Because these stocks really from the beginning of the year they're not doing great at all.

Jason Moser: No they're not and that's obviously because it's becoming very hyper-competitive environment and we'll talk a little bit about that when we discuss these together. Mastercard being the smaller of the two it feels like perhaps there's a little bit more of a growth opportunity there. I'm glad you mentioned the comp to 2019 numbers because clearly coming from 2020 that's maybe not as helpful but generally speaking this recovery rate we've seen with bank earnings here over the past several quarters the consumer is in a great spot. The consumer generally speaking has been at a very good spot. This job this employment issue not enough people to fill the jobs that are available out there is interesting to note. I feel like what remedies that is you just you could just go without a job for long enough and [laughs] you're going to run out of money that takes care of itself doesn't it?

Jason Hall: Yeah I think you're right. At the end of the day too if you think about the jobs that are open they're the jobs that people didn't really want to have two years ago anyway right?

Jason Moser: Yeah.

Jason Hall: People in the service industry if you've ever dealt with any kind of travel when people are already stressed hotel staff all of those sorts of jobs. That's the stuff that the people aren't filling so here we are. Given time I think you're right. I think that gets addressed.

Jason Moser: One thing I noticed in Mastercard's call and I'd be interested to hear your perspective on this because we've seen so much in the financial media landscape recently regarding the I-word inflation. That is the word of the day. Seemingly every day for the past several months. Clearly inflation is an issue. You have some folks arguing whether it's transitory or a bit more permanent in nature. I tend to feel like it's a little bit more permanent in nature but I guess we'll find out when we get there. But I did notice that the call with Mastercard. One of the questions was how does a business like this respond to inflation? Is inflation a good thing or a bad thing for a business like Mastercard? Management had an opinion there they said in the call they felt like if inflation is something where it's measured it's relatively modest it's paced you're not talking about some sort of hyperinflation type of environment. Typically that is going to end up being a tailwind for a business like Mastercard just based on the business model itself. I mean they're getting their interchange. They're getting the cents per transaction. I mean when you see something like inflation going through our economy at a measured pace ultimately the spending the dollars that are going through these networks are growing. Whether it's Mastercard or Visa they are going to benefit from that unless it's a hyperinflationary type of environment which can have other sorts of ongoing impacts.

Jason Hall: Yeah Jason this is exactly why FinTech is a thing. This is exactly why you have the Squares and the PayPals of the world that want a larger and larger portion of that payments business. Because at the end of the day the business model is so incredibly powerful. You mentioned operating leverage because even if inflation does affect them and their operating expenses to some extent the benefit is like orders of magnitude larger. In terms of you think about the revenues. These are [laughs] businesses that generate better than 50 points of gross margin so it is good. But again the risk and I really want to define it is if it's inflation that hurts the economy like really hurts the economy that's definitely not good. I think that's the key thing that they wanted to stress is that really it is good inflation which like it or not is a real thing. Good inflation is good for this business too much inflation that stalls the economy takes us back to where we were a year ago.

Jason Moser: Yeah well let's talk a little bit about Visa because very similar business of course a little bit bigger a very similar business. A little bit of a tougher week shares down about eight and a half percent. Again what I feel like it was a pretty good quarter I mean you saw numbers that indicate growth that indicate spending more dollars going through these networks more transactions happening. But there was one headline we saw throughout the week that I think along with the type of guidance and you could talk about that. But along with the type of guidance I think we're seeing Visa it seems like Visa's being targeted a little bit more by regulators here recently. Whether that's earned or not that's another debate entirely but it certainly feels like these relationships that they have with companies like Square and PayPal like you mentioned it started getting that headline where regulators looking into what you're doing and how you're making your business happen. Certainly that's going to create some near-term uncertainty I would think.

Jason Hall: This is a business that's gotten it's hand slapped in the past over anti-competitive practices. When you have more than half of the US share of those transactions regulators should be watching closely. Frankly I think it's good to have a dominant business for reasons but when you start running into anti-competitive practices I don't think it's a threat to the business but it's a risk that investors need to be very conscious of because if the company is forced to take steps that's going to cede some of their market guess what? That's the bottom line that's affected. I think you have to be conscious of that. I think the other thing too with Mastercard compared to I don't want to jump the gun here. But Visa's done an incredible job growing I mean it's gigantic even compared to Mastercard at least in the U.S. and overseas as well. But the growth opportunity for both of them is largely not just in these merchant transactions. You go into the store to buy stuff transactions you're getting a new Visa or Mastercard from your bank. That's great business and there's certainly growth there as the world moves to more digital transactions but you move to like business-to-business payments you think about the person-to-person payments. Those are like I don't know four times the size of the merchant markets that they do? I think Mastercard's done a better job there and I don't think that the market is responding to that. I don't think the market in general even really realizes broadly you know what I mean?

But I think the big thing for Visa is it was like one of those sell the news things. There was this expectation for guidance of being closer to 20 percent growth driven a lot by not just the strong transaction processing volumes that we've seen that have recovered and grown in some of these other areas. But just into like the whole travel thing started to get back to normal and that really important part of their business being just like gravy. Obviously management's not 100 percent sold that that's going to happen next fiscal year because they've just started their new fiscal year right now. It just doesn't seem like management's convinced that that's going to be like 20 percent revenue enough to push them to 20 percent revenue growth. Guidance was closer to like upper mid-teens right?

Jason Moser: Yeah. I'm glad you brought up all of these different ancillary almost. I shuttered a call on the ancillary because there's such a big market opportunities but I think so many people out there just think of Visa and Mastercard as the consumer card that is in your wallet. When you read into these two businesses both of them their strategy they start talking about this network of networks. That's why these businesses are so strong because there's such massive networks and they are looking to basically parlay that success of that mass of networking into the other networks within that network. I think that is part of the story that a lot of folks don't necessarily focus as much on but when you look at the sheer numbers involved you're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars moving around the world and these are two businesses with the networks that can absolutely help facilitate all of those different types of networks. Whether it's business to business business to consumer government to consumer whatever it may be.

Jason Hall: It's bananas how many of those transactions are still something that comes across an accounts payable department and they process it and an actual physical check comes off a printer somewhere goes into an envelope and gets mailed. Just the inefficiencies that are there are enormous and the ability to facilitate less human interaction drive a lot of those operational costs out but also speed up processing time. Because at the end of the day when there's money that's literally in the mail somewhere that's money that's not in your bank account. That's something that a lot of organizations they can improve their cash efficiency using what Visa and Mastercard can do. That's powerful.

Jason Moser: Yeah. That's exactly why I think you're seeing so much enthusiasm of companies like Bill.com for example. The company that just taking the world by storm here. If you look at the stock chart it's astounding honestly but it's because they're tackling that specific opportunity that you just talked about. The inefficiencies in small and medium-sized businesses just the nature of cutting physical checks. Just as an individual like when I have to cut an individual physical check I die a little bit inside sometimes.

Jason Hall: That's a moment that you will never get back in your entire life.

Jason Moser: I know.

Jason Hall: You're literally paying somebody and taking more of your time to pay them. It's 2021 come on what are we doing here?

Jason Moser: Well speaking of 2021 given the nature of FinTech this is a very fast-changing evolving space. There are a lot of different players and I get it. It is a massive market opportunity and there are a lot of hands in that cookie jar. Now some are going to succeed some are going to just disappear. But generally speaking and the conversation goes well this is FinTech. You look at Visa and Mastercard your days are numbered. I feel like that is a very simplistic argument that doesn't take into account a lot of the things that we just discuss there. But I'm curious to know how concerned should investors actually be about these two businesses being meaningfully disrupted from this move toward digital payments because I feel like maybe they're finding ways to participate as opposed to necessarily being edged out of the transaction entirely.

Jason Hall: Yeah. By and large I think that's the case is at the end of the day FinTech generally again we've only got a few minutes we can't really dive into this. We could do like a five-part show on this if you want to. That's what it would take to cover it. But I think the key thing to remember here is that the reason FinTech exists is all of these companies want to be in the middle. They want to participate somewhere in between you as the purchaser and me as the merchant. Or they want to be somewhere in between me and the bank or you and the bank. They want to be in that middle because it's so lucrative. Think about again those margins I mentioned that these companies generate at scale are enormous. You think about these relatively small fees that they charge to generate this incredible profitability. Being in the middle is really powerful. I think viewing Visa and Mastercard is at risk of disruption from that is inaccurate because they have competition. Competition is increasing and at the end of the day the network effect if your Visa and Mastercard is so strong. They have their relationships with the merchants already. The merchants trust them because they know they're going to get paid. The banks trust them because they know that they are secure and they have relationships with 99 percent of the merchants out there.

All of those things are there. If you're a consumer having their cards is either just a prerequisite because that's a debit card your bank offers or there's a rewards program that gives you some incentive and gets back to the power. There's so much strengthen that network effect that it's easy to overlook that. You know what it's hard to build that. It is really hard to build that. Technology has helped. It certainly helped the cloud has helped making it easier to build those networks out and attracts the different stakeholders and users. But I think sometimes we rushed to they're going to get disrupted and forget that guess what all these other FinTech companies that are in the same cabal. They want to do the same thing already and a lot of times they're going to partner with Visa and Mastercard anyway. I think we missed that. But to me Jason I think the biggest potential disruption is he who can pay me fastest and at the lowest structure fees wins. I think technology like blockchain is more likely to be a bigger source of disruption at some points than any of the FinTech players are to these businesses because it essentially eliminates the middle right?

Jason Moser: Yeah it seems like it improves the operating system. If you think of Visa and Mastercard these operating systems of the payments network and you search to their calls you'll see mention of blockchain frequently. They are utilizing that technology. So it's good to see them embracing that in order to be able to evolve because I think you're right. Getting that money from point A to point B as quickly as possible as cheaply as possible. That's ultimately what people want that's what businesses want that's what everybody wants. We're certainly finding new ways to do that and it feels like blockchain technology is going to be something that ultimately helps these businesses. To your point building a network like that. I think people just don't really think about the billions of cards that are out there with these brands on them. Whether it's Visa or Mastercard it's not easy to build that network. Regardless of your feelings of any particular FinTech operation that operating system is core to so much that's going on.

Jason Hall: Yeah no doubt about it. It really is. The other aspects of it too you have regulation in hundreds of countries and thousands of municipalities. The scale to have the resources to make sure you're meeting the regulations where you're doing business is another thing I think people forget about. Because the world is getting smaller and more international. Those are things I think that are easy to overlook. But at the end of the day the technology that gets people pay the fastest. When you can go from months to weeks that's great. But when you go from weeks to days that's incredible. But when you can go from days to now and again I think it's 5 10 years before that thing happens. The big problem with cryptocurrencies which are the monetary side of the blockchain is the volatility in value. Because sure it's great to be able to get it as a crypto asset but then they turn it into cash the thing that's still money that's another process in and of itself that has to be continually refined. But I think that's the biggest risk right now.

Jason Moser: Well the toughest week of them all goes to Robinhood. Robinhood earnings came out late last week as well. Shares had a tough week down about 11 and 1/2 percent in total. It feels like this is a polarizing business. There's some people who love it there some people who just can't stand it. I don't know that I would say I can't stand it but I certainly don't have any interest in owning these shares. Now you may feel differently but let's talk a little bit about the quarter because it did seem like they're starting to realize some challenges particularly because they are so heavily exposed to crypto.

Jason Hall: Yeah and it's certainly showing in what's going on with the user base. Bottom line it's not even just crypto but I think we're seeing the same thing just in their volume of stock transactions it's also coming down. Options might be the only part of the business that is actually doing OK.

Jason Moser: But how much of that do you think it's like the people don't fully understand what they're doing? There is a gambling sense to options unless you really actually know what's really going on.

Jason Hall: Yeah. No this isn't like Motley Fool Options. It's like the most boring possible way to do options that also generates income 97 percent of the time or whatever it is. Yeah it's gambling; it's just straight-up gambling. I think again that gets back to the big challenge with Robinhood from the beginning for so many long-term focused investors to say it's awesome that we have more people particularly young people that are thinking about making money with stocks. But it's like everything about the way their system is built gamifies it and turns it into the short-term quick-hit thing. If you look at the numbers if you look at something I sent a note to you. They reported third-quarter. They said that their monthly active users increased 76 percent and assets under custody increased 115 percent. But if you go back and look at the second quarter what you see is that they ended the second quarter with 21.3 million users they ended the third quarter with 18.9 million monthly active users; that's going the wrong way. Assets under custody ended the quarter at 95 billion they ended the second quarter at 102 billion. ARPU average revenues per user fell from $112 in Q2 to $65. Jason?

Jason Moser: That's a big drop.

Jason Hall: What do you think?

Jason Moser: Well there are a lot of different ways can look at Robinhood. I like the idea that we're getting a platform out there that wants to democratize investing and give everybody the access I feel like they can do a better job on the education side of things and maybe they'll get there. I think building that brokerage it can be sticky and from there once you have people in there then you can start rolling out educational and advisory services I think as you like. There's a lot of potential there. 22.4 million net cumulative funded accounts with $95 billion in assets under custody that sounds like a lot but when you do the math actually you're talking about the average net funded account $4200 a little over $4200 and that number is coming down. You don't have very high-value clients first and foremost right?

Jason Hall: Yeah. They lost about 100000.

Jason Moser: I'll bet you the median is far lower than that 4200. You're looking at a business that clearly they're doing some neat things but you have to wonder about the market that they are actually pursuing the demographic that they're pursuing. Because look at something like Charles Schwab for example Charles Schwab $7 1/2 trillion in assets under management and it's a $154 billion company. You've got Robinhood with just under $100 billion in assets under custody that's a $30 billion company. Those numbers don't even come close to making sense. There's clearly a lot of enthusiasm there for Robinhood I just feel like it's not been earned yet.

Jason Hall: I agree Jason. I want to like this business I really do.

Jason Moser: Yeah I do to.

Jason Hall: I want to like it so much you know what I mean? I think there's levers they can pull. You start adding IRAs you start letting people do rollovers and open up a Roth and start really thinking about the long-term distance future. I know they're working on those things. Maybe that can turn these losses and users that we're seeing maybe it can start turning that around. But how long has this company going public earlier this year?

Jason Moser: Yeah just a bit of a short time.

Jason Hall: Yeah. Thirty-five dollars a share IPOed at 38. The market is obviously nowhere near convinced.

Jason Moser: No.

Jason Hall: Is it going to be able to turn it around right?

Jason Moser: It's obviously very competitive environment. You've got companies out there like Public.com which is not public but if you've ever interfaced with Public that is a very slick mobile fast experience for investing. They really embrace the educational side of it. Much less of a focus on just things like crypto and options building neat thematic ETFs. When I see a company like Public and that to me I feel like Public is playing the long game whereas Robinhood is not quite sure what they're doing yet and that's what really concerns me.

Jason Hall: Yeah. I think that says it well. Here's the thing though the business is strong it's tons of money in the bank. Starting to burn cash though. Cash burn I think it's a real concern. The economics should be really good with this kind of business that it should generate pretty good operating cash flows but that's not the case this year. I think that's a real concern because when you're losing users when your average account balances are falling trading is falling your average revenue per user is down 40 percent those are some real things particularly for a cash-burning business. As much as I want to like the business I wouldn't touch the stock right now until the metrics they have to earn it right Jason? They have to earn it right now they're not.

Jason Moser: We'll leave it there. I think that's going to do it for us this week Jason. Thanks so much for taking the time to be here.

It’s been a regular chance for developer Riot to create a real-world spectacle ahead of the big game. In the past that’s meant everything from holographic musical performances to an appearance from an augmented reality K-pop group. In 2021 though things went in a different direction.

Without an audience in attendance due to COVID-19 restrictions Riot instead went with a pre-produced series of music videos that featured gigantic real-world sets spliced with moments from the upcoming Arcane animated series. It may not have been a live performance but it was still impressive. “This is really what feature films do what Marvel does” says Matt Kauth head of production at London Alley Entertainment which worked with Riot on the piece.

What premiered before Worlds’ championship match was essentially a 13-minute-long short film that combined animation music videos and physical sets. It featured a handful of performances from the likes of Imagine Dragons and Bea Miller interspersed with animated vignettes from Arcane which debuts on Netflix this evening. The idea of mixing live-action and CG isn’t exactly new but part of what makes the Worlds event work so well is the sprawling real-world sets designed to look like Zaun and Piltover two iconic cities from League (which are featured prominently in the Netflix show).

“These are the biggest sets that we’ve ever done and it’s probably not even close” says Kauth whose studio has worked on music videos for the likes of Lil Nas X and The Weeknd. “We shot this whole piece over three days in Los Angeles and three days in Birmingham UK. It is also the busiest it has ever been in the production landscape right now. Both because we’re coming out of the other side of covid but also because all of the streaming that’s happening. It’s never been busier and crews are very hard to come by. The LA shoot we were literally taking construction members rolling off of TV shows. And adding new crew members every single day in order to meet this time frame.”

Music videos were always part of the plan. But initially Riot had hoped to incorporate a live element as well. That changed when the company was forced to move the event from Shenzhen China to Reykjavík Iceland due to covid concerns. “We actually always intended for there to be this integration of music videos and more cinematic performances” says Nick Troop executive producer of the event for Riot. “Even when Worlds was still situated in Shenzhen we were going to shoot these videos this way. This was the general plan. And part of the magic of the stadium show was going to be to build this interplay between the live show and the stuff that was pre-recorded and use that to elevate what was happening in-stadium.”

The focus on physical sets is a contrast to past Worlds where new technologies like mixed reality were on full display. Part of the reason for the choice was practical. With a short timeline to finish the production the physical sets would put less strain on the various VFX teams that worked on it. If the videos had been shot with a green screen for instance it would’ve taken much longer to finish because artists would’ve had to design the backdrops virtually from scratch. “Our goal was to make sure that we were capturing as much in-camera as possible so that when we handed the baton off to the VFX departments they had enough to work with” explains Kauth. (Even still five different studios and 230 people worked on wrapping the post-production effects.)

Image: Riot

But the IRL sets were also chosen because Riot thought it would help differentiate the opening ceremonies from the many other virtual performances that have been happening of late particularly during the pandemic. Plus it just looked cool. “You can feel when it’s real” says Troop. “You live in a rendered world for the most part when you interact with League of Legends. Here is one of a handful of opportunities to bring it to life.”

It’s typical for large-scale movie productions like those from Marvel to utilize both large sets and multiple effects studio partners. But Kauth says it’s rare for shorter form projects like this. Not only did it help make the opening ceremonies look impressive he says but having so many people working on it also helped make it a more sustainable production where teams were able to largely avoid crunch. “It’s a film and TV approach to hit the deadline and not burn a single company into the ground” he explains.",,,,,,

It's the best-case scenario given that star signing Lionel Messi has picked up an injury and the team has struggled to reach its best form as it integrates its new players.

PSG will be hitting the road on Saturday to face Bordeaux in its 13th Ligue 1 match of 38 this season. A win would see it extend its lead atop the standings to 10 points over second-place Lens. The Parisian side will have to do it without Messi who has knee and hamstring ailments that already kept him out of a Champions League match against RB Leipzig.

The team's stars will then join their national teams for the November international window returning with PSG to face Nantes at the Parc des Princes on Saturday Nov. 20. PSG will enter one of the busiest stretches of the season with 10 matches to be played on three competitive fronts by year's end. Qualification to the knockout rounds of the Champions League will come down to the final two matches.

Big picture

Afghanistan might already be one of the most popular choices globally for cricket fans' second-favourite international team but when they take the field on Sunday they'll have more supporters rooting for them than ever before. Twitter is already full of India fans with Afghanistan flags next to their usernames. R Ashwin has already joked about India offering the services of their physiotherapist to speed up Mujeeb Ur Rahman's recovery from the injury that's kept him out of Afghanistan's last two games.

But there's a lot more to this game than the India subplot.

New Zealand and Afghanistan are both still in the semi-finals race. New Zealand have the simpler task - win and they're through no matter what India do later against Namibia. And if they do go through they'll be on course to complete a hugely impressive set of all-formats results in ICC tournaments - they were ODI World Cup runners-up in 2019 and they clinched the World Test Championship mace earlier this year.

An Afghanistan win is likelier to send India into the semis than themselves but given how improbable their journey has been in getting as far as they have as a cricketing force why would you rule out another improbable twist? They certainly have the firepower with the bat and more so with the ball to make that happen - particularly if Mujeeb is fit.

But no matter how far they go in this tournament Afghanistan's players will leave the T20 World Cup bubble - a refuge that is for them more than merely bio-secure - and return to realities that most of their counterparts from other nations would scarcely comprehend. These are hugely uncertain times for this brilliant group of players so whether you're an Afghanistan fan an India fan or anyone else be sure to wish them well.

Form guide

Afghanistan LWLWW (last five completed T20Is most recent first)



New Zealand WWWLW

In the spotlight

When he hits it right out of the screws - that whipped six off Jasprit Bumrah for example - he looks like one of the most dangerous powerplay hitters in the world but Hazratullah Zazai has only lit up this tournament in brief spurts so far as a strike rate of only 116.88 - his career strike rate is 148.64 - would suggest. Three of the four highest totals of this tournament have come at Abu Dhabi so if there are runs to be had on Sunday Zazai could choose no better time to unleash his full repertoire.

Trent Boult has taken eight wickets in this World Cup already but contrary to expectations only two have come in the powerplay. Abu Dhabi can offer a bit of early assistance to the seamers though and if Boult can get the new ball swinging he probably offers New Zealand their quickest and most efficient route to victory.

Team news

It's unclear yet if Mujeeb is fit to play but if he is he's likely to take the place of the left-arm spinner Sharafuddin Ashraf who was expensive against India on the same ground.

Afghanistan (probable): 1 Hazratullah Zazai 2 Mohammad Shahzad (wk) 3 Rahmanullah Gurbaz 4 Gulbadin Naib 5 Najibullah Zadran 6 Mohammad Nabi (capt) 7 Karim Janat 8 Rashid Khan 9 Sharafuddin Ashraf/Mujeeb Ur Rahman 10 Naveen-ul-Haq 11 Hamid Hassan.

A stinging straight hit from David Wiese struck Ish Sodhi on the head during New Zealand's last match against Namibia but the legspinner has passed a concussion test and is available for selection on Sunday.

New Zealand (probable): 1 Martin Guptill 2 Daryl Mitchell 3 Kane Williamson (capt) 4 Devon Conway (wk) 5 Glenn Phillips 6 James Neesham 7 Mitchell Santner 8 Adam Milne 9 Tim Southee 10 Ish Sodhi 11 Trent Boult.

Pitch and conditions

Three of the four highest totals of this World Cup have come at Abu Dhabi but the ground has also produced the lowest powerplay average of the three UAE venues used in this tournament. Expect some early help for the quicks but also expect the pitch to flatten out as the match progresses. The large boundary sizes could make for some interesting tactical battles especially if the location of the pitch adds an element of asymmetry.

Stats and trivia

Afghanistan have never faced New Zealand in T20Is. They have only met in ODIs so far at the 2015 and 2019 World Cups with New Zealand winning on both occasions.

Apart from Martin Guptill (134.09) all of New Zealand's batters have gone at strike rates of 111 or below against spin during this World Cup. Afghanistan will surely have made note.

Quotes

""They're spearheaded by Rashid Khan Mujeeb [Ur Rahman] is phenomenal as well and Mohammad Nabi is a very cagey offspinner through the powerplay too. That's definitely where the threat lies with their bowling attack and I'm sure all our batsmen during our scouting meeting have taken that into consideration.""

When you face guys like that for the very first time which we did today it was always going to be hard. We have a fantastic group of players and will go from strength to strength after this.""

Scotland who entered the Super 12 stage of the tournament for the first time are already out of the race for the semi-finals. They will play their last match of Group 2 against table-toppers Pakistan on Sunday.

The 37-year-old highlighted how cricket in the country can build upon its success of entering the Super 12 stage in the UAE and Oman this year in all aspects. ""I hope the years ahead are full of positive movement not only for us but also in the game to keep growing it as much as possible. It's so exciting to see various teams growing from strength to strength. You look at Oman how much they have developed in the last couple of years.""

""For us at Cricket Scotland it's brilliant to see how we have managed to see ourselves in Super 12 and qualifying for the next World Cup. There's plenty to look forward to. We can't be happy with just playing a few Super 12 games and going back to home and to our systems that we have there. We need to be brave and push that little bit further and we need support there.""

McCormick was one of three offensive linemen that the Steelers drafted last month. He played in 70 games for South Dakota State that included a school-record of 57 straight games so the Steelers are getting an experienced rookie.

Lee had 158 tackles 18.5 tackles for a loss and nine sacks in 43 games at Iowa.

The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts."

It is about 40 percent. The article has been corrected.

BRADFORD Pa. — Dustin Snyder was tired of the low wages the 60-hour workweeks and the impossible-to-please customers and so in early September the assistant general manager at a McDonald’s here drafted a petition that laid bare months of building anger and frustration.

“We are all leaving” his petition threatened “and hope you find employees that want to work for $9.25 an hour.” Nearly all of his two dozen employees had signed it. A few added their own flourishes.

“We need a RAISE” one scribbled next to her signature.

“Piss off” wrote another.

Dustin 21 could feel his heart pounding in his chest as he fed the petition into the fax machine in the McDonald’s office punched in the number for his bosses 80 miles away in Buffalo and hit send. Another low-wage worker rebellion in a season full of them.

A once-in-a-lifetime pandemic a debilitating recession and trillions in government aid had caused something to shift in the world’s largest economy. Hourly wages for fast food workers rose nearly 14 percent last year the fastest growth on record. All over America people were quitting jobs at record rates. Even in a place such as Bradford with its shrinking population and 30 percent poverty rate low-wage service workers sensed that they finally had a little power.

Soon after Dustin sent the petition the phone was ringing and the regional supervisor in Buffalo was demanding to know who was behind it. Dustin’s first instinct was to panic and plead ignorance. An hour later he called and confessed.

“I was trying to get better pay for my people” Dustin said.

Dustin Snyder 21 now the former assistant general manager at McDonald's and his co-workers staged a walkout and quit their jobs. He helped them find better paying jobs; now he rises early in the morning to pick some up and drive them to work at a lumber mill.

“There are better ways to go about this” the regional supervisor replied. She had been thinking about boosting pay at the Bradford McDonald’s she said but she was not going to give into threats or give up control. Because of the petition no one was getting a raise. If the workers did not like it they could quit.

Days earlier Dustin had accepted a job at a lumber mill that paid $11.50-an-hour or 60 cents more than he made as assistant general manager. But he did not really want to quit McDonald’s. He liked his co-workers who had become some of his closest friends and he liked being a leader. He just wanted some affirmation and a little more money both for himself and his team.

Dustin asked his employees to gather around him in the kitchen. Egg McMuffins sat half made on the counter. A clock on the cash register that tracked the restaurant’s drive-through times and transmitted the data back to corporate ticked away the seconds since their last completed order.

“Why would you want to work for a company that doesn’t value you?” Dustin asked. He turned to one of the restaurant’s longest serving employees. “You’ve been here for five years” he said. “What have you got for it? Nothing.”

The workers clad in their black uniforms ball caps and nonslip shoes stared at him unsure what they were supposed to do next. Dustin explained that he was leaving and locking up the restaurant. If they followed he promised he would help them all find better jobs. “How many of you want to go with me?” Dustin asked.

Initially there was silence. Then seven of the nine raised their hands. Two who decided not to join took seats at a table in the empty restaurant. The rest tossed aside their headsets and abandoned their posts at the drive-through and registers. Instead of racing to serve customers they began making food for themselves: a Quarter Pounder a large fries an iced caramel coffee with whipped cream and extra pumps of caramel.

Dustin’s anxiety which had been building since he sent the fax began to ebb. His co-workers were ebullient. “It’s a walkout” one yelled as they headed out into an economy where low-wage workers long-accustomed to feeling scorned ignored and invisible were realizing they suddenly had some agency.

We’re done

In the restaurant’s windowless back office Dustin was calling Stephanie Kelley the Bradford McDonald’s general manager to tell her what was happening.

“What if no one goes with you?” she asked.

“Everyone already said they were” Dustin replied.

Stephanie 36 had recently accepted a job at a bank in town and like Dustin was finishing out her final two weeks. She’d spent nearly a decade at the Bradford McDonald’s working her way up from the bottom to the restaurant’s top job. To join the protest was to throw away a reputation for hard work she had fought to build. To stay home was to abandon her employees.

“It won’t look good to get fired from McDonald’s” she told Dustin on the phone.

“I’ve already made up my mind” Dustin replied.

The discontent driving the Bradford workers and so many others had been there for years an ever-present aspect of an economy that could be especially cruel to anyone without an education. The pandemic — the fights with customers over masks and the fears of falling sick — added to the strain. But it was the labor shortages which extended to just about every part of the country that caused workers’ long-suppressed anger to burst into the open.

Unlike the strikes of an earlier era most of the walkouts included no picket lines. Rarely did the workers even make demands. “WE ALL QUIT SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE” read the message last June on a Burger King marquee in Lincoln Neb. where according to the workers the air conditioner had been broken for weeks and the temperatures in the kitchen soared past 90 degrees.

Sometimes workers left behind notes for bosses and customers that resembled parting primal screams: “We will not work for a company that DOES NOT care!!!” employees at a Del Taco in Circleville Ohio wrote.

“The staff at this location has walked out because we were being treated poorly overworked and underpaid” read a message from the employees of a Biggby Coffee in Toledo. Often the dashed-off notes became hits on social media passed along by equally fed-up workers. Sometimes they would show up in a short segment on the local television news before fading away.

Definitive numbers on these small-scale walkouts do not exist. The Bureau of Labor Statistics only tracks major stoppages that involve more than 1000 workers. But Mike Elk a labor reporter and founder of paydayreport.com has compiled a database of 1600 walkouts since March 2020 that included as many as 100000 workers.

Stephanie was now deciding whether she wanted to be one of them. Like her staff she had come to feel “degraded” and “belittled” by her bosses and some of the customers. The franchise owner had set the Bradford McDonald’s starting wage at $9.25 an hour while new workers at his McDonald’s less than 20 miles away in Olean N.Y. where the minimum wage was higher were earning $15 an hour. The low pay had made it almost impossible for Stephanie and Dustin to retain workers and keep the restaurant running.

Stephanie’s call with Dustin lasted only about a minute. She decided she could not let Dustin and their day-shift crew “do it alone.” She hung up and texted the night shift staff. “I want you all to know that everyone on the day shift just walked out and quit” she wrote. She said she was joining the walkout — “Effective 10:51 a.m. I no longer work at McDonald’s” — and encouraged the rest of the staff to quit too.

“I believe that you all are worth more than anything they’re giving you” she continued. “I am proud of all of you. Every single one of you. Whether you quit or not I am proud of you.”

Then she drove to the McDonald’s where she saw cars backing up in the drive-through. Most of the workers were gathered in the parking lot laughing and smiling. The worker who had been with the restaurant for five years was sobbing. She had been swept up in the initial excitement of the walkout but was now worried about finding a new job and paying her rent. She was terrified of losing her subsidized apartment.

“We will help you get a job that pays better” Dustin reassured her. He and Stephanie were going to drive everyone to the Burger King two miles away where Stephanie knew the general manager and the pay started at $10 an hour.

Before Dustin locked the doors he realized there was one last thing he wanted to do for his McDonald’s customers. He could not find a pen so he snatched a blue highlighter from the back office. “Due to lack of pay we all quit” he scribbled.

In the parking lot a half-dozen employees were waiting on him for rides to Burger King. The line of cars full of hungry and angry customers now wrapped around the building.

“Hey! We just want a Quarter Pounder and fries” a man called out to Dustin from his car.

“Well we just want to be paid more and treated better” Dustin replied.

‘Tough times’

Dustin and his co-workers had come to feel that no one understood what their jobs and lives were really like. The biggest frustration was the pay which had been $8.25 an hour until the franchise owner boosted it by $1 a few months into the pandemic.

“We understand these are tough times” Enrico Francani the owner wrote in a letter to the staff explaining the increase.

“How can you say you understand tough times when you’re only paying people $9.25 an hour?” Dustin recalled thinking.

The restaurant continued to lose long-serving shift managers throughout 2021 to entry-level jobs at Walmart ($13.75 an hour) and Tim Hortons ($12 an hour). The departures hit the Bradford McDonald’s especially hard at the beginning of the month when disability checks arrived and customers had money to burn on burgers and fries.

“Can anyone go into work right now? They’re down 6 shifts and drowning” Stephanie wrote on the employee group chat on Sept. 1 four days before the walkout.

A few minutes passed with no response.

“Anyone??” she asked again.

The only thing that seemed to matter to the corporate office were the numbers: revenue drive-through times and the weekly tally of complaints. Once Dustin worked 30 hours straight to prepare the restaurant for a health inspection. It passed but the criticism from the bosses about the restaurant’s cleanliness and his inability to retain employees continued unabated. Heavy turnover led to more mistakes and longer wait times for customers who took their frustration out on workers who already felt stigmatized by their fast-food jobs.

“The hate is towards the wrong people” said Caitlin Cox a shift manager newly pregnant with her second child. “It’s ridiculous.” She was certain that customers who regularly belittled the staff for enforcing mask mandates or botching orders would judge her harshly for having a baby while “flipping burgers.” And she had come to dread the thought of working at McDonald’s while she was visibly pregnant.

In Bradford once home to entrepreneurs and wealthy oil barons the population is shrinking. Buildings in the downtown area are mostly empty.

The owner ferried by his driver typically visited the Bradford location just once a year employees said and not even that often once the pandemic hit. Dustin believed that Francani was relying on his Pennsylvania restaurants — with their low salaries — to offset higher costs in New York where he had to pay his McDonald’s workers $15 an hour.

Francani did not respond to a list of detailed questions regarding his Bradford location. In a statement he said that he had initiated a series of “listening sessions” with workers and was adding paid sick leave and raising starting wages in Bradford. “We’re very grateful for the outstanding efforts of the McDonald’s Bradford team” he wrote.

McDonald’s USA issued a statement in which it said it was “disappointed” by the poor treatment that employees had endured at the Bradford restaurant: “The allegations shared in this reporting are deeply troubling and have no place in a McDonald’s-branded restaurant. Quite simply they are unacceptable.”

Dustin understood that Francani was entitled to pay his Bradford workers about 40 percent less than his nearby New York employees. “It’s a good idea but you’re hurting people” he said. “At what price is it enough? At what point is it just not worth it? What’s the cost of another human being to you?”

‘A high school job’

These were some of the questions that people in Bradford were fighting about in the immediate aftermath of the walkout. Less than an hour had passed before someone snapped a picture of Dustin’s sign on the drive-through speaker and posted it in a Facebook group called “B----ing Bout Bradford.”

Most of those weighing in on the McDonald’s walkout were service workers: certified nursing assistants waitresses security guards and store cashiers who were barely scraping by themselves. Theirs were the voices of a place whose best days seem behind it. On Bradford’s mostly empty Main Street Art Deco Italianate and Neo-Classical buildings loom as a reminder of an earlier era when the city was home to wealthy oil barons and hungry entrepreneurs. The Zippo factory opened in 1932 still ships its iconic windproof lighters all over the world. But the region has been bleeding manufacturing jobs and people for years.

“Do you have the next great idea?” asked signs from the Bradford Area Alliance offering a $20000 prize to help seed a local start-up. Set amid abandoned storefronts the question came off as a plea.

Some speaking out on “B----ing Bout Bradford” blasted the work stoppage as an act of entitlement — another sign of America’s moral decay and waning work ethic. “You got what you deserve when your paycheck came in” wrote a 41-year-old father of two young boys. “Probably didn’t deserve that because it sounds like you were just there putting in time with bad attitudes instead of working to make your situation better.”

Other commenters called fast food “a high school job” whose long hours and low pay were supposed to spur young workers to strive for more. Dustin and his crew they said should “go back to school” “quit making excuses” get a second job or move to a city with higher wages and more opportunity. Or they complained about the service at the McDonald’s (“I’ve never one f---ing time got my order right! Not once!”) and derided the penmanship on Dustin’s hastily scribbled sign. (“Maybe they should be home practicing their handwriting skills.”) The McDonald’s workers’ demands to be seen and heard had broken some unspoken rule; their anger seemed to threaten Bradford’s social order.

Others countered that big companies such as McDonald’s had a moral obligation to pay their employees enough to survive. “We have families and bills and can’t even get through with the pay we get” wrote a cashier at the Bradford Dollar Tree. And they called for a higher minimum wage to match the $15 an hour that workers were making in New York.

Just like the critics the walkout’s defenders cast the protest as a symptom of a much larger societal disease made worse by the labor shortage and the long pandemic.

“People in the service industry are done with the disrespect” wrote a local physician. “I don’t think it’s just about the money. … Whether it’s about flipping burgers or saving lives they crave gratitude and validation. Society has become so intolerant. So disrespectful. So judgmental. So cruel. Let’s change it.”

Soon some of the McDonald’s workers were weighing in to explain themselves and defend their colleagues. “You have NO RIGHT to talk down on those workers when they take a stand and have had enough” wrote John Lockwood who had worked at the restaurant for 20 years and had quit earlier that morning. “If you don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes keep your f---ing mouth shut.”

‘The McRejects’

Of the Bradford McDonald’s workers who remained after the waves of spring and summer attrition five had intellectual or physical disabilities that made it hard for them to find work at a better pay Dustin said. Two were 17-year-old girls who had quit school and were homeless. In the immediate aftermath of the walkout one of those teenage girls Shakira Griffin was waiting in the McDonald’s parking lot for Dustin to give her a ride to Burger King where she planned to fill out an application.

She phoned her boyfriend and her mother. Neither answered. A few hours later she texted both to let them know about the walkout. “Steph and Dustin is helping us get jobs” she wrote.

Shakira had started at McDonald’s in March after her mother lost custody of her and her father and his new girlfriend had kicked her out of their house. Before she dropped out of high school in the spring her teachers had tried to look out for her as best they could. Her favorite a special-education teacher had slipped her $25 to buy some bras and on her birthday gave her a dark green American Eagle hoodie that hung loosely on her skinny frame.

“I could tell you that it wasn’t cheap!” said Shakira of the sweatshirt that she wore everywhere.

Like so many of her colleagues Shakira had grown accustomed to being told she was not good enough: by teachers fellow students and even her parents. Now she was jubilant. “I was doing stuff with people besides arguing” she said of the walkout. “I was standing up for myself and what I deserve. I’ve never done that before.”

Griffin and Gray take a walk in the woods.

By nightfall a crew of $15-an-hour McDonald’s workers had arrived from New York and reopened the drive-through though the rest of the restaurant remained closed. The Bradford workers were still buzzing with excitement.

“Let’s all stand outside the mcdonalds and riot. Hahaha” one crew member wrote on their chat.

“I love all you guys. You are amazing” another added.

“We’ll be friends forever” wrote Matthew Arndt who was developmentally delayed and autistic. “Remember my door. My heart is open.”

Six years earlier Matt had taken a Greyhound bus to Bradford from Tacoma Wash. to visit a woman he met while playing a video game called “Second Life.” The woman turned out to be married. Now Matt 32 lived with her her husband and another developmentally delayed woman in a rotting brown and yellow two-story rental which had no working furnace black mold and bedbugs. Matt was the only one in the house with a job and they had all come to depend on his salary to survive.

He had not been back to see his father or siblings since arriving in Bradford. His job at McDonald’s was his refuge. His co-workers had become his family. Sometimes he and the rest of the night shift crew would finish work around 2 a.m. and walk two miles to the Sheetz coffee shop where they would talk and eat mozzarella sticks boneless chicken bites and burritos until dawn.

Matt texted his colleagues that the regional supervisor had called him and was trying to entice him to stay but that he was not going to betray his friends.

“She’s desperate now” he wrote.

“Yeah” agreed Shakira who also had received a call. “She really is desperate.”

The workers continued texting for several more hours. They complained about the people in town who were deriding them for walking out.

“People think fast food workers are lazy” one former crew member wrote. “All they want is their muffins and nuggets.”

“Yeah we ain’t people” another replied.

They traded gossip about which workers might be staying. Several noted hopefully that the drive-through line at Burger King seemed longer than usual and that maybe the shutdown had scared some McDonald’s customers away.

Someone suggested they rename their McDonald’s group chat. Matt came up with the idea that they immediately and unanimously decided to adopt: “The McRejects.”

‘A slap in the face’

Dustin rose at 4 a.m. and headed out the door to his car still clad in his camouflage pajama pants and a hoodie. A month had passed since the walkout. It was his day off but he had promised two of his former McDonald’s crew members who he had helped land jobs with him at the lumber mill that he would drive them to work every day. Neither had cars.

“Jesus it’s cold out this morning” Dustin’s first pickup of the morning said as he slid into the passenger seat. “I left my window open last night and just about froze my balls off.”

“Yesterday was colder” Dustin replied as he steered through Bradford’s empty streets. The “check engine” light on his dashboard glowed.

Most of the McRejects found new jobs for higher pay at Burger King Dunkin’ and the Save-A-Lot grocery store. Shakira landed a $10 an hour position stocking shelves at a Crosby’s convenience store and was living with her boyfriend’s family. Matt and his best friend from McDonald’s David Putnam were making $12 an hour at Tim Hortons doughnut shop. The extra money meant David who was raising his 2-year-old son on his own no longer needed donated food from the “Blessing Box” near his house. He had recently even been able to treat his mother and stepfather to dinner at the Hunan Buffet across the parking lot from his new job.

Matt’s finances were still tight. One of his housemates had recently been kicked off disability and he was using his extra pay to help cover her portion of the rent.

After just three weeks at the lumber mill Dustin got a $1 raise to $12.50-an-hour part of a companywide pay hike. He hoped the money would help him finally afford his own place. For the moment he was paying his mom who was on disability and his stepdad who did not work about $850 a month to live in his childhood bedroom. The money helped to cover their rent and the food stamps they lost due to Dustin’s income.

By this point in his life Dustin had hoped to have moved out of his childhood bedroom. Shortly after high school he left Bradford in search of a better life in Maine where he had helped a family from his church start a new congregation. He had considered going to college to become a pastor. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life and it felt meaningful” he said. But he did not have the money for school and fell out with his church. Lately he said he felt as if he was “just kind of floating.”

On this day floating meant grabbing a few hours of sleep playing video games and then heading back to the mill around 4 p.m. to take his friends home. They tossed their helmets and lunch pails in his car’s trunk. The smell of sawdust clung to their clothes and filled Dustin’s car. One of his friends was complaining about the job which required them to stand in one spot for 10 hours a day lifting and stacking wooden boards.

“Ugh the repetition” he said. “It just repeats and repeats and repeats.”

“You gotta look at it a different way” Dustin countered. “It stinks because it is the same thing every day. Yeah it’s boring. But it’s a good paycheck and they treat you with respect and like a human being.”

Former McDonald's employees Dustin Snyder left and RJ Schmidt 19 head home after work.

Most of the workers in Dustin’s section had been at the mill for only a couple of months and Dustin attributed the heavy turnover to the tedious nature of the job. He tried to fight off the boredom as best he could by asking questions about the different kinds of wood they processed and how the different machines worked. He chatted up the fork lift driver who had been at the mill for almost three decades and was making $30 an hour. If he could just make it to three months Dustin knew he would qualify for a $300 bonus a 401(k) and health insurance — something he had been without for more than three years.

“It’s super easy” he said of the lifting and stacking. “You barely move.” The downside was the monotony which was numbing in a way that McDonald’s had never been.

Weeks passed and Dustin found it hard to stop thinking about his old job. He missed the friendships he’d built at the restaurant. He missed the challenge and satisfaction that came with helping his intellectually disabled workers master a task. He missed being a leader.

When Dustin ran into one of the McDonald’s Sunday regulars who gathered at a back table to gossip and complain about their shrinking pensions he quizzed him about service at the restaurant. The man grumbled about the rising price of coffee and the “haughty” new staff at the restaurant.

“We didn’t get paid enough” Dustin replied “but we tried to treat you well.”

Whenever Dustin passed the McDonald’s he would take note of the number of cars lined up at the drive-through. “I think they’re losing customers” he would often say.

About six weeks after the walkout Dustin noticed that the owner had changed the sign on the restaurant’s marquee. “Hiring starting at $10” it now read.

The 75-cent raise was all that he and his staff had really wanted and all that they had been fighting for. But to Dustin it still felt like a “slap in the face.” His former bosses seemed to be sending him a message that their fight was never really about pay. It was about status and power and proving to Dustin and the others that despite their modest gains and whatever changes might be taking place in the U.S. economy they were still replaceable.

Dustin did not regret the walkout. He had “refused to bow down to the big scary corporation” he said. He had rallied his friends and helped them find similar work at higher pay. Dustin’s lumber mill job would do for now. Maybe the meaning he had been searching for would come later.

McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski on Saturday apologized for a text sent in April to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot saying his comments were “wrong” while promising to meet with the parents of children whose shooting deaths prompted the text.

“Those comments were wrong and I’m sorry” Kempczinski said in the six-minute video viewed by Restaurant Business. “I’m sorry I let you down. And I let myself down.”

In the text Kempczinski referred to the shooting deaths of the 13-year-old Adam Toledo by Chicago police and 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams while she was in a McDonald’s drive-thru. He called the shootings “tragic.” He then said “Both the parents failed those kids which is something you can’t say. Even harder to fix.”

Activists discovered the text as part of a freedom of information act request and revealed it last week igniting protests at company headquarters and widespread criticism particularly in and around Chicago.

On Friday Adams’ mother Lanesha Walker demanded an apology according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “I am a grieving parent. I’ve been grieving for the longest and from your place of power you insult me. How dare you judge me.”

“She’s right” Kempczinski said of Walker’s comments. “Part of what I feel so badly about is my comments have compounded the grief Adam Toledo’s family and Jaslyn Adams’ family have already experienced.”

He said he hoped to meet with the parents of both children and apologize in person.

The video was taken Saturday morning at Chicago headquarters and was sent to the system in the afternoon. Kempczinski who took over the top job at the chain almost two years ago to the day at times struggled to get through the apology particularly when he brought up the reaction from his own daughter. “For me probably no question was more poignant than when my daughter asked me ‘Why did you say that?’” he said. “In that question there’s a lot. Disappointment. Confusion. And certainly disagreement with the idea and the sentiment that was expressed.”

The uproar has come at a particularly sensitive time for McDonald’s which is fending off several lawsuits from former executives vendors current and former franchisees alleging racial discrimination in the way the company did business.

The text wasn’t lost on some of those filing the lawsuit. Domineca Neal one of two former executives suing the company for discrimination said the comments were “not a one-off mistake” and represented “the real Chris Kempczinski.”

The CEO who took the top job after his predecessor was fired for having a relationship with an employee had told company employees after the text was revealed that his comments “lacked the empathy and compassion I feel for these families.”

His video on Saturday went further. He said that his comments “reveal my narrow worldview that I have to work hard to correct.

“I need to find ways to better myself to expand my perspective so I can represent the entire system even those parts of the system I maybe don’t have a lot of experience with.”

Kempczinski said that his actions “fell short” of the company’s values and said that he plans to “read every email every text I receive from every one of you and learn from your feedback.""

And Kempczinski said he plans to reach out to community leaders to understand more and “continue to lead this great company in a way that’s inclusive.”

Lanesha Walker whose seven year-old daughter Jaslyn Adams was killed at one of the fast food giant's Windy City restaurant's in April lashed Chris Kempczinski over remarks he made in a text to Mayor Lori Lightfoot days later.

She raged: 'How dare you judge me! How dare you say I failed my child! I wasn’t there when my child was killed' she said in an interview with Chicago Sun-Times.

'Mr. CEO you have no clue what it’s like to live on the South Side and West Side in the trenches where it gets real treacherous just to survive just to protect your children' she continued. 'You come from privilege. You can’t speak about me.'

Kempczinski whose firm is itself headquartered in Chicago texted Lightfoot commenting on the recent killings of Jaslyn and 13-year-old boy called Adam Toledo.

'With both the parents failed those kids which I know is something you can't say. Even harder to fix' the multimillionaire McDonald's executive wrote in the text which was revealed this week in response to a public records request about the mayor's communications.

Jaslyn was in her father's car at a McDonald's drive-thru on April 18 when she was riddled with bullets and killed as part of a suspected ambush targeting her dad who was said to be in a gang.

Three weeks prior 13-year-old Adam Toledo was running away from the police with a gun in his hand when he was shot dead by an officer less than a second after the teen dropped or tossed the weapon aside. The CEO was also referring to that killing in his text.

Kempczinski reached out to Mayor Lightfoot a day after Jaslyn's killing following a meeting at McDonald's headquarters.

The mayor sidestepped the CEO's remark concerning the shootings in her reply writing back to him: 'Thanks Chris. Great to see you in person. Such a great work space and your folks were terrific. I said to Joe I would be happy to reach out to the operator to offer support. He and his team members have got to be traumatized. Terrible tragedy. Thanks again Chris.'

Walker said her daughter loved McDonald's and ate there twice a week and for the company's CEO to make disparaging comments about her and other parents who lost their children to gun violence showed a lack of respect and compassion.

In a text message to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot in April Kempczinski wrote that Jaslyn and Toledo's parents 'failed those kids'

'My daughter was gunned down in one of your McDonald’s and to this day has anyone from your company reached out even just to offer your condolences? No. Instead you tear me down' the mother continued.

Walker insisted that Kempczinski knows nothing about the 'hood' and demanded that he meet her face-to-face in her community and learn about the effects of gun violence on families.

'Mr. CEO you don’t know me. You don’t know anything about us. You’re on the outside looking in from your high pedestal judging us' Walker argued. 'You don’t know anyone’s real situation.'

Despite the McDonald's executive's highly critical comments Walker said she knows that she is a good parent and that she did not put her daughter in harm's way.

Kempczinski's comments revealed as part of a Freedom of Information Act requesting Lightfoot's communications were met with widespread condemnation which prompted the executive to backpedal.

In an internal memo to McDonald's US corporate employees seen by DailyMail.com Kempczinski said that his remarks were emotional and regrettable.

'When I wrote this I was thinking through my lens as a parent and reacted viscerally. But I have not walked in the shoes of Adam's or Jaslyn's family and so many others who are facing a very different reality' Kempczinski wrote in the memo.

'Not taking the time to think about this from their viewpoint was wrong and lacked the empathy and compassion I feel for these families. This is a lesson that I will carry with me' he added.

Jaslyn's father Jontae Adams 29 has admitted knowing that he was a potential target for gang retaliation but didn't think anything would occur on the day he took her to get McDonald's.

Prosecutors say that Jaslyn and her father were in a McDonald's drive-thru in Homan Square on April 18 when three men pulled up in a silver Audi and riddled their vehicle with at least 28 bullets. Jontae Adams was shot once and injured Jaslyn was hit multiple times and killed.

'My daughter wanted McDonald's. I tried to Uber McDonald's' Jontae Adams said in an interview with WCGI-FM referring to the food delivery service. 'But my baby wanted to see me.'

'As far as my actions or my past maybe it had something to do with it. But I was a father the day my daughter died. That's all I remember being. I don't remember gang-banging. I don't remember what led to it' he continued.

'I'd do it again. My baby wanted McDonald's and I would take her to McDonald's again. Nothing is going to stop me from being a father and putting a smile on my baby's face.

Chief Executive Geoff Martha is pushing the company to take advantage of technological advances such as in robotics and broadband and changing dynamics in where and how people work. He and other top executives presented a new strategic plan with a dizzying number of pieces.

""Medtronic will no longer be known as just a medical device company"" Martha said when it was announced last month. ""We're going beyond devices to help technology serve more people in more ways.""

Medtronic headquartered in Ireland with operational headquarters in Fridley restructured into 22 small units to take out bureaucratic layers and spur innovation. It raised its research and development spending to $2.7 billion this fiscal year from $2.5 billion last year.

It just launched a rebranding effort to emphasize innovation. It also has reached gender equity in pay in the United States.

For all the pieces to work Martha said in an interview the company must foster a culture that values equity sustainability and teamwork.

""The burden of disease brings deeply personal costs. There are deep societal costs as well"" Martha said. ""If we're not going to take a leadership role then who? Businesses need to step in and lead.""

Streamlined for speed

Medtronic got a lesson in those costs as the coronavirus pandemic unfolded last year.

In the early months of the pandemic it became clear Medtronic needed to make more ventilators. The company would need to become quicker and more collaborative and use its R&D muscle to keep up with the demand and protect health care workers.

Bob White president of the medical surgical portfolio said Medtronic soon realized it would have to innovate differently and more collaboratively to meet the need. The company increased production fivefold at its plant in Galway Ireland.

After Elon Musk tweeted that he would help Medtronic reached out and SpaceX started making a needed part. The company also worked with chipmaker Intel to develop remote monitoring and programming capabilities so health care workers would not need to go in a patient room for every adjustment.

Medtronic worked with other partners to put together plans for the Coventor a simpler ventilator that got designed and obtained Food and Drug Administration approval in less than 30 days.

The company figured out how to outfit the 400-bed Javits Center in New York City over Easter weekend. People who worked in other units asked to help out. Internal approvals were streamlined.

""Work that would have taken months took weeks work that would have taken weeks took days"" White said.

""The speed with which we operated taught our teams that we could move faster"" he added. ""The teams don't want to go back.""

Besides collaborating with other companies the pandemic allowed Medtronic to work more closely with socialized medical systems in Europe and with developing markets in African nations.

The United Kingdom had a huge backlog of people scheduled for colonoscopies because in the early days of the pandemic non-emergency procedures were postponed.

Medtronic had an alternative called the Pillcam that was getting regulatory approvals. The device is exactly what it sounds like: a tablet with a tiny camera and sensors inside that a patient swallows while wearing a recording device on the wrist. The data is sent to the patient's practitioner. Then if there are any signs of lesions or polyps a more invasive colonoscopy can be done Martha said.

That kind of direct collaboration with a government to meet specific needs is an area that could be expanded he said.

The goals ahead

In its last fiscal year Medtronic served 72 million patients. The goal is to increase that number to 85 million by fiscal year 2025.

This growth is a necessary component if Medtronic is to reach another target. It wants 20% of revenue to flow from products and therapies released in the prior 36 months. Currently that number is 17%.

To get there Medtronic must not only focus its R&D dollars it must also continue a robust acquisition strategy and improve quality control so the devices are ready for market sooner.

The need to have many products in the pipeline is evident in two recent developments. Medtronic in October learned it would need to wait until a clinical trial involving its new Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system is completed before moving further toward commercialization.

Executives hoped interim results would be positive enough that Medtronic could advance the device which is inserted in renal arteries to lower blood pressure. Now it might be 2023 before the device goes to market.

On the other hand the company passed a huge regulatory hurdle this fall in the European Union on its Hugo robotic-assisted surgical system. Technology for that product came out of Covidien the Irish company Medtronic bought in 2014 in one of medtech's biggest acquisitions. Medtronic said only 2% of surgeries in Europe are done using this type of technology so it is a huge opportunity.

Now comes the work of getting payments approved more hospitals signed up and a more robust training program in place. Martha said advances in broadband specifically 5G will allow the company to not only train more people remotely but perhaps eventually have surgeons off-site directing surgeries.

New advances new challenges

The advances in computing power that allow for data to be collected and transferred — and the artificial intelligence field — will help transform what types of products Medtronic will produce in the future.

So will miniaturization — as in the Pillcam — and robotics as the Hugo system uses.

New frontiers will come with more challenges. The company has had several high-profile voluntary recalls over the past few years. While it is working to address the problems that arose with those products it also is building a new accountability and quality-control structure said Noel Colon Medtronic's chief quality officer. The goal: decreasing customer complaints by 10% over the next few years.

Advances also will force Medtronic to work more with tech giants such as Google and Apple which he said are also becoming competitors in the ""periphery spaces"" Martha said.

But without an aggressive strategy using technology to create products for the next generation Medtronic will not grow at the pace it needs to. Already Martha and his predecessor Omar Ishrak predicted that Medtronic would only hit 5% growth with its current portfolio — and pre-pandemic it wasn't always hitting that mark.

One of the company's previous CEOs Bill George now a professor of management practice at Harvard recently wrote about a chance Medtronic had in 1991 to buy a company with emerging cardiovascular technology. He declined deciding there were some patent and regulatory issues that were too risky.

Those issues came to be yet a competitor bought the company and it took Medtronic 20 years to catch up he wrote.

Today Medtronic's competitors are coming from places like China Martha said. Venture capital and government support are readily available that could take a company serving the Chinese market and expand it to compete on a global level.

Equity and sustainability

Medtronic also is competing more and more with large technology companies for talent. That is adding urgency to to the company's equity and sustainability goals.

Medtronic joined a growing number of companies pledging net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It also set goals on reducing packaging and water waste.

Equity goals include having 45% of managers globally be women and 30% of managers be ethnically diverse by fiscal year 2026. At the end of fiscal 2020 39% of managers were women and 23% were ethnically diverse.

All those goals are tied to business goals. Investors are looking at sustainability measures plus the European Union and California have environmental regulations that will go into effect over the next few years. Studies show that businesses that have management teams that are diverse both in gender and race perform better.

But how workers see the company is also part of the strategy.

""They want to work for a company that stands for something"" Martha said.

Turnover is at 13% said Carol Surface chief human resources officer. However the company said interest measured by applications for open positions is up 40% and 50% for career engineering jobs.

Response from the investor community was generally strong to Medtronic's new goals.

Analysts from BTIG wrote recently: ""While it may take time for MDT to achieve its targets some of which we view as aspirational the collective efforts should support value creation longer-term.""

'You have to foster belonging'

A recent McKinsey Global Institute study of Fortune 500 firms found that only 37% of companies that had put into place restructuring plans actually achieved them.

Medtronic started talking about change before the pandemic and it made progress on several fronts such as pay. .

""I think that a lot of companies discover that change can happen very quickly"" said Mario Moussa a Pennsylvania consultant who works with companies on cultural change. ""But we're creatures of habit. It can go right back"" to the traditional methods.

Creating new ""rituals"" and engaging workers in what works and what doesn't is key to forward momentum. That employee engagement he said will ""validate that you respect their work."" Employees need to feel comfortable to perform their best he said.

White the chief of the company's medical surgical business said cultural work will keep Medtronic's strategies moving forward.

""You have to be intentional"" he said. ""You have to foster belonging. For me that's about fostering voice.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyYW5zY2F0aGV0ZXItbWl0cmFsLXRyaWN1c3BpZC12YWx2ZS1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC1pbmNoLWZvcndhcmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transcatheter Mitral Tricuspid Valve Replacement Inch Forward,"Promising results with the Intrepid TMVR and Evoque tricuspid systems set the stage for the pivotal trials now underway.

Early feasibility data from two studies of valve replacement presented at TCT 2021 show promise for novel transcatheter devices for mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

The Intrepid (Medtronic) transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) early feasibility study showed no mortality stroke reintervention or new pacemaker implantation within 30 days in the first 15 patients treated via the transseptal approach. Also 6-month outcomes from the TRISCEND study confirmed what was seen at 30 days with significant reductions in tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and good survival following transcatheter implantation of the Evoque device (Edwards Lifesciences).

“This is the future” commented Luigi Salemme MD (Montevergine Clinic Mercogliano Italy) during a press conference. “We are moving to an interventional treatment of tricuspid and mitral disease.”

Intrepid EFS

Firas Zahr MD (Oregon Health and Science University Portland) who presented the Intrepid findings told TCTMD that “for an early feasibility study these are very encouraging results.” The trileaflet bovine pericardial valve which affixes to the mitral valve with outer stent anchors without capturing the native leaflets is identical to that already being studied transapically in the ongoing APOLLO trial where “the morbidity and mortality early on is very high due to the complications [related to] transapical access as well as its impact on the myocardial muscle” Zahr said. With a transseptal delivery system what is novel here “the hope was that will address some of these concerns.”

For the multicenter study which was simultaneously published in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions Zahr and colleagues implanted 15 patients (mean age 80 years; 87% male) with at least moderate-to-severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) who were at high or extreme risk for mitral valve surgery with the Intrepid TMVR valve which was mounted on a 35-Fr transfemoral delivery system. At baseline 67% of patients were classified as NYHA class III or IV.

Average procedural time was 46 minutes and most patients (93%) received the 48-mm valve. Notably one patient was converted to a sternotomy due to valve migration. Atrial septal defect closure was performed in 73% of patients and mean length of stay was 5 days. One patient had a periprocedural MI due to an air embolism.

At 30 days there were no reports of all-cause death stroke reintervention new pacemakers or acute kidney injury stage 2 or higher. Seven patients reported MVARC-defined major bleeding events including six major vascular complications all related to the access site. One patient was rehospitalized due to a minor vascular complication.

Echocardiography at discharge showed 21% of patients with mild MR but by 30 days all patients had none or trace MR. Paravalvular leak was seen in 7% at discharge but disappeared in all by 30 days. Also LV outflow tract obstruction was moderate in 15% of patients at discharge but zero or mild in all at 30 days.

Functional outcomes were good with 57% and 29% being classified as NYHA class II and I respectively at 30 days.

Based on these results Zahr reported that the transfemoral delivery system will now be rolled into the APOLLO pivotal trial. “Maneuvering the system has proven in the study to be relatively straightforward” he said. “Despite the fact that it's early feasibility most of the procedures were done under 1 hour because maneuvering the valve to the mitral annulus is very similar to maneuvering other devices that are commercially available in the mitral space.”

He admitted that the vascular complications observed were “a bit higher than we were hoping for” although this is likely related to early experience and variability in anticoagulation regimens as well as “trying to figure out what's the best way to use the venous system for a large-bore sheath.” A 29-Fr delivery system is currently in development Zahr said. “I'm hoping that as the sheath is getting smaller . . . as well as us learning what's the best way to manage vascular access and the best way for us to anticoagulate those patients perioperatively that will hopefully address some of those bleeding complications.”

In the press conference Rajiv Tayal MD (Valley Health System Ridgewood NJ) said “this is clearly an exciting look into the future and very reassuring to a degree aside from the complications which are somewhat expected as we go with 30-plus Fr devices. I think it's incredible and I'm very excited for it.”

Moderator Roxana Mehran MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY) said she too was excited about the results even though “35-Fr scares the dickens out of me.” For the next phase “this obviously would be best approached to see this in a smaller French size.”

TRISCEND at 6 Months

Presenting the 6-month results of TRISCEND Susheel Kodali MD (NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York NY) said the Evoque system which securely attaches into the tricuspid annulus by “engaging leaflets chords and the annulus” demonstrated that the favorable 30-day outcomes were sustained at 6 months.

Of the 132 patients enrolled (mean age 79.2%; 74% female) 6-month follow-up was available for 56. Baseline TR grade was at least severe in 88% of patients and 90% had atrial fibrillation; 67% of patients were in class III/IV heart failure prior to implantation. Procedural device success was 96.2% with most (94.7%) having right vein femoral access.

At 30 days 18.5% reported major adverse events including three cardiovascular deaths one renal complication 22 severe bleeds two major access-site and vascular complications two reinterventions and one major cardiac structural complication. The all-cause mortality rate was 3.2% and eight patients required a new permanent pacemaker.

At 6 months TR severity was mild in 49% with the remaining 51% reporting none or trace levels (P < 0.001 vs baseline). Both the rates of survival (96%) and freedom from heart failure hospitalization (94%) were high at 6 months. Also significant improvements were seen in NYHA class with 89% of patients in class I or II at 6 months; 6-minute walk distance with an increase of 56 m; and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score with an increase of 27 points (P < 0.001 for all).

As a result of these and earlier findings the randomized pivotal TRISCEND II trial is already underway.

Kodali stressed to TCTMD the importance of new transcatheter devices to treat TR. “There's not really great options for these patients” he said adding that the number of patients he’s seen in the clinic over the last several years has been “steadily increasing.” Kodali also noted that challenges in this space have related to adequate imaging and that even the procedurally-challenging edge-to-edge technologies can still leave patients with moderate or even significant TR.

The biggest hurdle right now with this system relates to the high bleeding rate he said. “A lot of them are not access-site—urinary tract GI other factors—but this is a patient population that has sort of high bleeding risk to begin with. But 17% at 30 days is definitely a significant bleeding rate and we need to understand why that is and we have to manage anticoagulation differently. It's important to dive more deeply into this and do better.”

Ultimately the data show that “the device works” Kodali said. “I think it's a reproducible procedure and I think from a feasibility standpoint it showed that it's feasible. You can eliminate TR patients in general have done well. Whether this is clinically beneficial I think the randomized trial is designed to show that.”

In the press conference Mehran questioned the need for tricuspid replacement as opposed to repair. “It just seems like it's a big to-do” she said. “Do you think that there are so many pitfalls to the repair that you need a replacement?”

Previous edge-to-edge repair studies like CLASP TR and TRILUMINATE have shown benefit but also have limitations related to “large gaps broad jets [and] imaging” Kodali said. “So there are trade-offs. I think over the next decade-plus we're going to need to understand which patients benefit which way and I think that's where the real knowledge gap is. We have a long way to go. We're just trying to get to the point [to know if] treating TR helps these patients.”

Tayal commented that this procedure “clearly seems to be a little bit more straightforward” than other investigational technologies to date.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoaW5lLmNuL25ld3MvbWV0cm8vMjExMTA3Nzc3OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TCM hospital's gaofang is just the tonic,"Staff at Shanghai Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine began to make gaofang a seasonal herbal paste tonic on Sunday.

Staff at Shanghai Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine began to make gaofang a seasonal herbal paste tonic on Sunday.

Sunday is lidong which means the start of winter according to the Chinese calendar.

Under traditional Chinese medicine concepts taking gaofang can enhance health especially for those with weak immunity and chronic diseases. It also helps the elderly.

While other hospitals hire pharmaceutical companies to produce gaofang Yueyang is the only one to sustain traditional means by having a special plant with 100 bronze vessels to make the tonic.

This year it moved its vessels into a new two-story gaofang center which consists of a gaogang plant and a gaofang museum to promote TCM culture.

Gaofang is a herbal paste made of condensed liquid herbal medicines chock full of ingredients like honey and brown sugar. Each paste is tailor-made according to a doctor's prescription.

Yueyang has more than 40 years of gaofang prescription and production. Some 10000 people have reserved its gaofang clinic this year said Zhou Jia president of Yueyang hospital.",,,,,,

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

Thomas: Yeah thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktZmFjZWJvb2stbWV0YXZlcnNlLW1hcmstenVja2VyYmVyZy1kOTk2MTdiOTM5OWJlZTVjMDliYzdhY2ViNTkzZWVjZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plenty of pitfalls await Zuckerberg's 'metaverse' plan,"When Mark Zuckerberg announced ambitious plans to build the “metaverse” — a virtual reality construct intended to supplant the internet merge virtual life with real life and create endless new playgrounds for everyone — he promised that “you’re going to able to do almost anything you can imagine.”

That might not be such a great idea.

Zuckerberg CEO of the company formerly known as Facebook even renamed it Meta to underscore the significance of the effort. During his late October presentation he effused about going to virtual concerts with your friends fencing with holograms of Olympic athletes and — best of all — joining mixed-reality business meetings where some participants are physically present while others beam in from the metaverse as cartoony avatars.

But it’s just as easy to imagine dystopian downsides. Suppose the metaverse also enables a vastly larger yet more personal version of the harassment and hate that Facebook has been slow to deal with on today’s internet? Or ends up with the same big tech companies that have tried to control the current internet serving as gatekeepers to its virtual-reality edition? Or evolves into a vast collection of virtual gated communities where every visitor is constantly monitored analyzed and barraged with advertisements? Or foregoes any attempt to curtail user freedom allowing scammers human traffickers and cybergangs to commit crimes with impunity?

Picture an online troll campaign — but one in which the barrage of nasty words you might see on social media is instead a group of angry avatars yelling at you with your only escape being to switch off the machine said Amie Stepanovich executive director of Silicon Flatirons at the University of Colorado.

“We approach that differently — having somebody scream at us than having somebody type at us” she said. “There is a potential for that harm to be really ramped up.”

That’s one reason Meta might not be the best institution to lead us into the metaverse said Philip Rosedale founder of the virtual escape Second Life which was an internet craze 15 years ago and still attracts hundreds of thousands of online inhabitants.

The danger is creating online public spaces that appeal only to a “polarized homogenous group of people” said Rosedale describing Meta’s flagship VR product Horizon as filled with “presumptively male participants” and a bullying tone. In a safety tutorial Meta has advised Horizon users to treat fellow avatars kindly and offers tips for blocking muting or reporting those who don’t but Rosedale said it’s going to take more than a “schoolyard monitor” approach to avoid a situation that rewards the loudest shouters.

“Nobody’s going to come to that party thank goodness” he said. “We’re not going to move the human creative engine into that sphere.”

A better goal he said would be to create systems that are welcoming and flexible enough to allow people who don’t know each other to get along as well as they might in a real place like New York’s Central Park. Part of that could rely on systems that help someone build a good reputation and network of trusted acquaintances they can carry across different worlds he said. In the current web environment such reputation systems have had a mixed record in curbing toxic behavior.

It’s not clear how long it will take Meta or anyone else investing in the metaverse to consider such issues. So far tech giants from Microsoft and Apple to video game makers are still largely focused on debating the metaverse’s plumbing.

To make the metaverse work some developers say they are going to have to form a set of industry standards similar to those that coalesced around HTML the open “markup language” that’s been used to structure websites since the 1990s.

“You don’t think about that when you go to a website. You just click on the link” said Richard Kerris who leads the Omniverse platform for graphics chipmaker Nvidia. “We’re going to get to the same point in the metaverse where going from one world to another world and experiencing things you won’t have to think about ‘Do I have the right setup?’”

Nvidia’s vision for an open standard involves a structure for 3D worlds built by movie-making studio Pixar which is also used by Apple. Among the basic questions being resolved are how physics will work in the metaverse — will virtual gravity cause someone’s glass to smash into pieces if they drop it? Will those rules change as you move from place to place?

Bigger disagreements will center on questions of privacy and identity said Timoni West vice president of augmented and virtual reality at Unity Technologies which builds an engine for video game worlds.

“Being able to share some things but not share other things” is important when you’re showing off art in a virtual home but don’t want to share the details of your calendar she said. “There’s a whole set of permission layers for digital spaces that the internet could avoid but you really need to have to make this whole thing work.”

Some metaverse enthusiasts who’ve been working on the concept for years welcome the spotlight that could attract curious newcomers but they also want to make sure Meta doesn’t ruin their vision for how this new internet gets built.

“The open metaverse is created and owned by all of us” said Ryan Gill founder and CEO of metaverse-focused startup Crucible. “The metaverse that Mark Zuckerberg and his company want is created by everybody but owned by them.”

Gill said Meta’s big splash is a reaction to ideas circulating in grassroots developer communities centered around “decentralized” technologies like blockchain and non-fungible tokens or NFTs that can help people establish and protect their online identity and credentials.

Central to this tech movement nicknamed Web 3 for a third wave of internet innovation is that what people create in these online communities belongs to them a shift away from the Big Tech model of “accumulating energy and attention and optimizing it for buying behavior” Gill said.

Evan Greer an activist with Fight for the Future said it’s easy to see Facebook’s Meta announcement as a cynical attempt to distance itself from all the scandals the company is facing. But she says Meta’s push is actually even scarier.

“This is Mark Zuckerberg revealing his end game which is not just to dominate the internet of today but to control and define the internet that we leave to our children and our children’s children” she said.

The company recently abandoned its use of facial recognition on its Facebook app but metaverse gadgetry relies on new forms of tracking people’s gaits body movements and expressions to animate their avatars with real-world emotions. And with both Facebook and Microsoft pitching metaverse apps as important work tools there’s a potential for even more invasive workplace monitoring and exhaustion.

Activists are calling for the U.S. to pass a national digital privacy act that would apply not just to today’s platforms like Facebook but also those that might exist in the metaverse. Outside of a few such laws in states such as California and Illinois though actual online privacy laws remain rare in the U.S.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzYvMjI3NjY5MzUvZmFjZWJvb2stbWV0YS1hd2FyZS1wcm9ibGVtYXRpYy11c2UtYWRkaWN0aW9uLXdlbGxiZWluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook reportedly is aware of the level of 'problematic use' among its users,"Facebook’s own internal research found 1 in 8 of its users reported compulsive social media use that interfered with their sleep work and relationships— what the social media platform calls “problematic use” but is more commonly known as “internet addiction” the Wall Street Journal reported.

The social media platform had a team focused on user well-being which suggested ways to curb problematic use some of which were put into place. But the company shut down the team in 2019 according to the WSJ.

Pratiti Raychoudhury a vice president of research for Meta Facebook’s new parent company writes in a blog post that the WSJ misrepresented the research (a claim the company has made about some of the other articles the WSJ has produced based on Facebook’s internal documents).

She says the company “has been engaged and supportive throughout our multiyear effort to better understand and empower people who use our services to manage problematic use. That’s why this work has taken place over multiple years including now.” Raychoudhury argues that “problematic use does not equal addiction” and that the company ships “features to help people manage their experiences on our apps and services.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNy9mYWNlYm9va3MtbWV0YS1leGlzdGVudGlhbC1waXZvdC1mb3Itc3Vydml2YWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook’s 'meta-existential' pivot for survival,"Jacob Mullins Contributor

Investment Banking 2.0 Says “Hello World!?”

Facebook is in the fight for its life but it won’t be the regulatory pressure that will kill it. Zuckerberg is leaning heavily on “metaverse” as a lifeboat to save a declining user base. He has long known that the future of Facebook is rooted in owning a major hardware platform.

Facebook’s brand pivot to “Meta” last week week is the third inning of a multibillion dollar game of balance sheet roulette. Let’s see if consumers adopt and make it a reality — all of Meta/Facebook is at stake.

As an investor in VR and AR since 2016 I find it cautiously encouraging to hear all the talk of “metaverse” on trending business channels today. Could this really be the time for VR?

The most valuable companies in the world own the metal on which their software applications run: Apple and Microsoft have had their fingers in the hardware pie for years and even Google was able to build a robust OS business with Android. Facebook’s billion-dollar acquisition of Oculus in 2014 more than showed Zuck’s hand though it would be another seven years until the pivot actually happened.

In the years directly after the Oculus acquisition there was a flurry of investment in VR across the industry. Hardware platforms from Google Microsoft Sony HTC Steam and others were announced with great fanfare though these investments were largely scrapped or defunded a few years later leaving a dearth of VR hardware platform options.

This is when Facebook struck. It upped its investment in the Oculus/Reality Labs platform innovating to create high-quality mobile VR hardware devices started seeding game developers with capital and voraciously acquired the most engaging games on their platform. Taking a developer ecosystem approach through acquisition is a long-play investment to solve the cold-start content problem that all of these VR platforms faced.

Zuckerberg started with gaming because it’s the earliest category of high-engagement consumer excitement and growth thus turning up the temperature on consumer comfortability in a headset. Next Zuck is moving VR/AR into the enterprise to drive hands-on 3D collaboration by remote teams to a distributed workforce readied through the pandemic.

Lucky or good he is known as a prescient strategist. He has displayed excellent strategy in response to market movements and timing not all of which he controlled.

The “metaverse” already exists in Fortnite and Roblox. Zuck is betting we want fully immersive experiences through head-worn computers and can drive an older user base.

If Facebook’s acquisition history is a guide Zuckerberg’s strategy will find success though Facebook’s most successful acquisitions including WhatsApp and Instagram were already proven social successes at the time they were acquired. Going all in on the “metaverse” is creating a new platform and paradigm that has been woefully slow to find adoption despite multiple hype cycles over 30 years of excitement.

Given the balance sheet this will likely work — but today it’s still a master stroke of strategy and opportunity existing in a vacuum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21ldGEtbWVhbmluZy13aGF0LWZhY2Vib29rLW5ldy1uYW1lLWNoYW5nZS1tZWFuLW1hcmstenVja2VyYmVyZy1tZXRhdmVyc2UtMTI3NDQyN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta meaning: What Facebook's name change means and Mark Zuckerberg's plans for a 'Metaverse' explained,"Facebook is following in Google’s footsteps by renaming its parent company.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the company will now be known as Meta – though its individual platforms including Facebook itself will keep their current names.

He explained that while Facebook was one of the most used products in the world the name no longer reflected the true breadth of the company’s ambitions.

Facebook also owns Instagram WhatsApp and Messenger along with other products such as the Oculus virtual reality headset.

Google made a similar move back in 2015 renaming its parent company Alphabet to show how it had grown beyond the original search engine.

What does ‘meta’ mean?

Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the word “meta” as follows: “Showing or suggesting an explicit awareness of itself or oneself as a member of its category.”

It can also mean “concerning or providing information about members of its own category” as well as being a prefix that means “after” or “beyond”.

Mr Zuckerberg has said he hopes for Facebook to become a “metaverse” company referring to a theoretical digital universe with its origins in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash.

The metaverse allows humans to interact as avatars letting people work shop learn and play in virtual reality spaces without being physically together.

In Stephenson’s book the metaverse is the virtual reality successor to the internet.

Why has Facebook changed its name?

Mr Zuckerberg told the company’s annual Connect conference: “Right now our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can’t possibly represent everything that we’re doing today let alone in the future.

“Over time I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company and I want to anchor our work and our identity on what we’re building towards.

“We’re now looking at and reporting on our business as two different segments: one for our family of apps and one for work on future platforms.”

He added: “Now we have a new north star to help bring the metaverse to life and we have a new name that reflects the full breadth of what we do and the future that we want to help build. From now on we’re going to be metaverse first not Facebook first.”

At the conference Mr Zuckerberg also confirmed that in future people will no longer need a Facebook account to use the company’s other services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLXdpbGwtaXQtYmUtYS1kZWNlbnRyYWxpemVkLWhhdmVuLW9yLWEtY2VudHJhbGl6ZWQtdHlyYW5uedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Metaverse: Will it be a decentralized haven or a centralized tyranny?,"Last week Facebook rebranded to Meta and announced its plans to kickstart the development of the Metaverse — an entirely new way of interacting and navigating the internet. Now the Metaverse landscape has a multi-billion dollar corporate behemoth vying for the helm which has made its future all the more uncertain.

Whether we like it or not major corporations will likely play a major role in how the Metaverse develops and evolves. But will it be plagued by the same problems faced by today’s social media giants or will decentralized platforms and services take center stage?

Building a digital walled garden

At last week’s Facebook Connect conference Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to spend $10 billion this year alone on the development of the Metaverse — an ecosystem of interconnected digital experiences services and platforms that seamlessly blend with the real world.

But as Facebook has shown time and time again — such as when it backpedaled on its pledge to not require a Facebook account to use its Oculus products — it will almost certainly look to enforce strict controls on how the Metaverse is used and accessed. After all ecosystem lock-ins are a popular tried-and-tested way to force continued engagement while isolating the competition.

Given that Zuckerberg himself billed the Metaverse as the “next generation of the internet” that will be used by hundreds of millions of users it seems unlikely that a corporate goliath with shareholders to please won’t do everything in its power behind the scenes to position Meta at the center of the Metaverse.

As a vast upcoming landscape that will without a doubt introduce new ways to create socialize and work online the Metaverse stands to become a ubiquitous medium that most internet-savvy individuals will interact with to some degree.

Likewise given the recent release of the damning “Facebook Files” by The Wall Street Journal it has been revealed that the social media platform has been suffering from a whole plethora of issues and operating with some seriously dubious business practices — ranging from a huge lawsuit to lax content moderation to the preferential treatment of certain users. All of which is in stark contrast to Zuckerberg’s supposed egalitarian vision for the Metaverse.

If the Metaverse is made in Facebook’s image count me out.

These documents also show that Facebook is rapidly losing favor among millennials — the generation most likely to interact with Metaverse technologies.

Meta has already been widely slammed for its plans and was recently labeled a “cancer to democracy” by American politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a recent Twitter lashing. This sentiment appears to be the general consensus on Crypto Twitter which didn’t react favorably to the news.

Meta as in “we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society… for profit!” https://t.co/jzOcCFaWkJ — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 28 2021

The game is rigged and it’s not in your favor. Meta wants to own your digital identity and given its way it will have access to more of your data than ever before. No thank you!

The blockchain catapult

Blockchain is widely expected to become one of the key technologies enabling the development of a truly pervasive virtual space that can be navigated just as securely as the Web 2.0 internet.

Thanks to blockchain-powered digital identity solutions that will power truly persistent digital avatars along with digital assets that provide region-agnostic access to services and products the Metaverse looks set to inherit the values that the blockchain industry was founded on — namely permissionless access censorship resistance security and decentralization.

Related: Regulators are coming for crypto: Is digital identity the answer?

Nonetheless tech incumbents will eventually look to muscle in on the blockchain infrastructure side of things in an attempt to direct the development of the Metaverse and shape it in their own image. After all given that the Metaverse industry is slated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.1% over the next few years while the blockchain technology sector is projected to soar by 32.4% until at least 2025 there is a strong financial incentive to establish an early foothold.

Twitter is set to be one of the first to get in on the action with Bluesky a decentralized social media protocol that will eventually be used to host a variety of social networks — Twitter included. However given that Twitter too has been subject to more than its fair share of controversies including dubious account suspensions high-profile account hijackings and numerous reports of government censorship it isn’t so clear-cut as to whether this will support the aforementioned core tenets.

Not to mention the fact that Twitter (and many other social media platforms) are banned in several countries. And as we have seen before with Facebook’s Novi wallet product corporate crypto projects tend to attract excessive regulatory scrutiny often severely restricting their scope and eventually resulting in a watered-down product wherein the balance between profit and progress is often skewed to the former.

A range of crypto-native social media platforms and metaverse projects are currently in development and arguably have a major head-start and technical advantage over corporate-backed offerings in that they can remain truly permissionless and democratic. This includes the likes of Decentraland and Bloktopia — which already provide an early view into what the Metaverse could be through their complex user-controlled economies virtual real estate and digital VR-based digital experiences.

Been a few days since we turned off the lights shut down the human cannonball and bundled Juan into the bus. So it feels like the right time to look back on an amazing four days that was the #MetaverseFestival. A thread... pic.twitter.com/hgnAREtuaW — Decentraland (@decentraland) October 29 2021

Other pure-play decentralized social media platforms are also on the horizon including Bitorbit. Based on Velas (a Solana fork) Bitorbit is designed to tackle the very problems that make corporate-owned social media such a bleak experience for users and creators — using blockchain to restore privacy and help users better monetize their content and transact securely online.

Given its potential to radically change the way we interact with one another and go about our daily lives the Metaverse is shaping up to be a pivotal technology for all of us.

But with corporate giants set to clash with the motivated and resourceful blockchain community over the development and nature of the Metaverse it is still unclear whether it will be yet another tool designed to exploit the masses or the promised land we all want.

He had given his team an early lead with a leaping catch for a 30-yard touchdown reception but loads of good and bad and everything in between coalesced to put the Giants in an advantageous or precarious spot depending on your perspective. They were clinging to a seven-point lead at Metlife Stadium but the Raiders were on the march against a Giants’ defense that does not exactly corner the market on triumphant last stands.

“I don’t know if there was a camera on me but I was pretty stressed out’’ Engram said. “I was nervous. We’ve been in that situation before.’’

History says the Giants rarely come up big in this spot.

Derek Carr marched the Raiders from his own 25-yard line to the Giants’ 13 with 50 seconds left. Carr rolled to his left and under pressure threw the ball away. On second down Carr was sacked by rookie outside linebacker Quincy Roche who did not realize he knocked the ball loose.

“I just heard the crowd start screaming and that’s how I knew’’ Roche said.

Leonard Williams pounced on the ball with 37 seconds remaining and that was that. The Giants head into their bye week with a 23-16 victory that was all sorts of improbable in the making.

“I’m proud of the way the team responded this week’’ coach Joe Judge said.

It was certainly not an ordinary week. A bunch of false positive COVID-19 test results wreaked havoc with the schedule forcing players to stay away from the team forcing meetings to be held remotely and leading to all kinds of uncertainty as to who would be available for this game and who would not as the COVID-19 protocols cycled through.

If there ever was a game to struggle it was this one for Xavier McKinney the second-year safety. He was on the field only one day for practice this past week as he was one of the false-positives. McKinney did not struggle. He soared giving the Giants points with a pick-six of Carr early in the third quarter and pointed his team to the victory with a second interception this one with 5:12 remaining as Carr looked deep to Zay Jones who was covered by James Bradberry. Carr never saw McKinney roaming over to make the play.

“I was beat on a double move and Xavier saved my life’’ Bradberry said.

McKinney’s second pick came with the Giants up 20-16. With Devontae Booker (99 yards on 21 carries) out with a hip injury the Giants were left without any halfbacks. Fullback Eli Penny had runs of 11 and 12 yards to get the Giants in range for Graham Gano’s 38-yard field goal for a seven-point lead with 3:21 to go. The defense did the rest and the Giants go into their bye at 3-6.

“Every time you go into a bye with a win it feels good’’ Engram said.

It was a strange outing for Daniel Jones who completed all nine of his first-half passes and finished 15 of 20 but for only 110 yards. He completed only three passes to his wide receivers and targeted them only four times. The Raiders came in as the 28th run defense in the league and the Giants wanted to attack that vulnerability. They ran for 149 yards.

“We knew it would be one of those games’’ Jones said. “When the offensive line is playing like that you lean on it. We have the versatility as a team to play different ways.’’

This “different way’’ did not produce a second touchdown after Engram scored 4:14 into the game. There were three Gano field goals and it would not have been enough if not for a points pick-me-up from the defense.

It was a 13-10 halftime deficit for the Giants but they did not stay down for long. McKinney jumped in front of Hunter Renfrow for an interception of Carr that McKinney took 41 yards down the right sideline for a touchdown that put the Giants ahead 17-13. They were the first points produced on defense this season.

“I just read the quarterback’’ McKinney said. “All eyes on the quarterback the whole time.”

The one day of practice was enough for McKinney.

“He did his best Ferris Bueller this week’’ Judge said. “Didn’t have to show up for work and have a career-type game.’’

It looked as if the Raiders would take the lead or at least get closer when they advanced 70 yards but no further when safety Logan Ryan dropped Josh Jacobs with a strong tackle short of a first down. Then shockingly Daniel Carlson missed a 25-yard field goal attempt with 9:28 remaining.

This was a trend. The Raiders after a first-quarter touchdown got to the Giants 6- 14- 7- 7- and 13-yard lines — five trips into the red zone that added up to only nine points.

“I’ve got to be better’’ Carr said. “This one’s on me.’’

The Giants will take it and gladly head off into their bye week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raW5nNS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3RlbGV2aXNpb24vcHJvZ3JhbXMvYmVuZWF0aC10aGUtc3VyZmFjZS9nby1pbnNpZGUtY2xpbWF0ZS1wbGVkZ2UtYXJlbmFzLWx1eHVyaW91cy1hbWVuaXR5LXNwYWNlcy8yODEtMTJhODEyYjYtMDJmNS00MmYyLWJhYmUtMjc4YWM0ZDgxODcx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Go inside Climate Pledge Arena's luxurious amenity spaces,"The new Seattle arena has seven amenity spaces for premium ticket holders including suites and a modern food hall.

Sports Writer

The Las Vegas Raiders entered the 2021 season with lots of optimism. Heading into the year their division was considered as one of the toughest in football with defending AFC champion Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs sophomore QB Justin Herbert and his upstart Los Angeles Chargers and the Denver Broncos with young wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. The Raiders led by head coach Jon Gruden and quarterback Derek Carr still believed there was a route for them to make the playoffs even with their tough competition.

On the field the Raiders have not only met expectations but exceeded them. They are 5-2 heading into a Week 9 date with the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium following their Week 8 bye. Their only losses were to Herbert’s Chargers and to rookie QB Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears. With the Chargers’ Week 8 loss in LA to Mac Jones and the New England Patriots the Raiders have a comfortable lead in the AFC West with the Chargers being the second closest team at 4-3 following their loss. However the Raiders’ on field success has been overshadowed as they have been in the headlines plenty through the first half of the season but for off-field controversy.

Following the team’s loss to Chicago on October 10 Gruden was questioned about emails that had leaked from his time working as an analyst on ESPN’s Monday Night Football broadcast. In the emails he criticized the executive director of the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) DeMaurice Smith and used a racist stereotype to describe his appearance. More emails from Gruden leaked in the coming days which included him making racist misogynistic and homophobic comments. Gruden’s comments came from different points in his career including his time as head coach of the then Oakland Raiders as well as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and his time working at ESPN following his stint with Tampa Bay. As these emails became public Gruden decided to resign from his position as head coach of Las Vegas saying that he did not want to become a distraction to the team.

Raiders owner Mark Davis replaced Gruden with special team’s coordinator Rich Bisaccia in the interim head coach position. The Raiders have won both of their games with Bisaccia as head coach since beating the Broncos in Denver and beating sophomore QB Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles in Vegas heading into their Week 8 bye. But just as the team thought they were beginning to separate themselves from off-field headlines another story broke.

This Monday wide receiver Henry Ruggs was charged with reckless driving and driving under the influence resulting in death. In Nevada both crimes are felonies and Ruggs will face 2 20-year sentences in prison. Ruggs was reportedly driving 156 miles per hour and his blood alcohol content was over twice the legal limit when he fatally struck the car in front of him. The victim was 23-year-old Tina Tintor who worked at a nearby Vegas Target and her dog. The Raiders released Ruggs the following day and gave their condolences to the family and friends of the victim. When asked about Ruggs Carr said that he wishes there was something he could do to prevent the tragedy.

The Raiders hope to make the playoffs this year even though their off-field issues have very much overshadowed them. The pressure the players must face when they are questioned about Gruden’s comments and Ruggs’ decision only adds more distractions for a team that wants to be the best they can be on the field. However the Raiders organization is no stranger to off-field drama. They have built their legacy on being the “bad boys” of the league. This persona even carries on to their fans who nicknamed their old stadium “The Black Hole” and their new stadium “The Death Star”. The response by the Raiders players and organization has been masterclass and proves the age-old adage “practice makes perfect”. Especially QB Derek Carr who has done a good job keeping the team together with all of the adversity they have faced. They head into MetLife Stadium this week with one goal: to beat the Giants and increase their lead in the AFC West with a flailing Chiefs’ team and young Herbert and the Chargers trying to get back into the division race as the season rolls into November.

So who’s buying?,"At least two Las Vegas gaming giants — MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment — are currently shopping Strip resorts. The big question is who’s going to end up buying them.

Vegas has no NBA team (yet) but can it support 2 arena projects?

The Mirage on the Strip seen in May 2021. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae

You won’t see their listings pop up on Zillow but at least two Las Vegas gaming giants are currently shopping Strip resorts.

MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle made a somewhat surprising announcement this past week on a quarterly earnings call that the company is in the “early stages” of selling The Mirage. A day earlier Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said that the company is planning to sell one of its Strip resorts sometime in early 2022.

We won’t know for sure until things crystalize over the next several months or longer but the attention now turns to the pool of potential buyers. Hornbuckle didn’t name a price tag for The Mirage or possible buyers and Reeg has yet to say publicly which property or properties Caesars is looking to offload.

Barry Jonas an analyst with Truist Securities said Friday that there are a “number of regional commercial and tribal players who could make sense to expand to the Strip to scale up their operations and drive cross-property synergies.”

Some such groups have already publicly expressed their interest in grabbing a spot along the iconic corridor.

Speaking to members of the press in Las Vegas last month at the Global Gaming Expo Seminole Gaming CEO and Hard Rock Entertainment Chairman Jim Allen was upfront that the group is eyeing options in town.

“We recognize that Las Vegas is the capital of gaming in the United States” Allen said. “If that opportunity comes up then yes we would be interested.”

If they’re interested in The Mirage the group isn’t saying. A spokesperson for Seminole Gaming said in an email this past week that the company has “no updates to share at this time.”

Alan Feldman a distinguished fellow at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute said that Hard Rock “would be very near if not at the top of the list” of potential new operators for The Mirage. But there are plenty of other viable candidates he added including regional casino operators based in other markets that could be looking for a foothold on the Strip.

“Having The Mirage as your marquee property could be very exciting because now you have customers in regional markets accumulating loyalty points and an absolutely iconic property in Las Vegas to use those points” he said.

Penn National Gaming President CEO and Director Jay Snowden had similar comments when asked about The Mirage on the company’s earnings call on Thursday saying “If we were to find the right asset at the right location at the right price of course we’d be interested.”

Penn is in the process of selling its lone Strip hotel-casino — the Tropicana — to Bally’s Corp. for $308 million. The company also tried but failed to buy The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas losing out to MGM’s $1.6 billion bid to acquire its operations. But Snowden said he doesn’t feel the need to chase any property just to get onto Las Vegas Boulevard.

“It would be great to have an asset that we could create some retention value when (customers are) in Vegas” Snowden said. “But we don’t think that such a strategic imperative that we would chase an asset or overpay.”

Diversification

Combined Caesars and MGM currently operate more than half of the casinos that sit on the Strip. MGM is in the process of adding another having agreed in September to buy the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in a deal expected to close next year.

Both companies moving to sell off one of their properties will be good for the livelihood of the Strip said Chris Grove an analyst with California-based Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.

“Competition drives innovation and innovation is critical to the Strip continuing to earn its historical reputation as a one-of-a-kind destination” Grove said. “The Strip has always relied on cycles of new ownership that build something fresh and intriguing on top of the firm foundation provided by the experiences of the past. It feels like we’re due to enter one of those cycles. “

History

Feldman the UNLV fellow knows The Mirage as well as anyone.

He moved to Las Vegas in 1989 for the opening of the resort as an outside public affairs adviser. He spent 11 years with the-then Mirage Resorts and another 18 with MGM Resorts after MGM merged with Mirage in 2000.

With its focus on luxury and world-class features The Mirage helped change the face of Las Vegas by ushering Las Vegas into a new era dominated by integrated resorts that went far beyond the casino floor and helping cement the blueprint that every other company would soon follow.

And it caught the attention of Wall Street like never before Feldman said. Even though the resort was built using so-called junk bonds the resort paid them off faster than most and replaced them with low-interest mainstream loans.

“What followed The Mirage was billions and billions of dollars of investments in Las Vegas” Feldman said. “Had The Mirage not succeeded that never would have happened.”

While the resort is now more than three decades old it still has outstanding value to potential buyers Feldman said.

It sits on 77 acres right in the center stretch of the Strip with plenty of unused space where new attractions or buildings could be built. The resort has been remodeled and upgraded multiple times helping hide its age.

“As it is it’s thriving” Feldman said. “But with some renewed energy and a new point-of-view you could do even more.”

Remember that you can always email us send a message via Facebook or use Twitter and include photos too. We’ll try to cover a Compensation Clinic case here regularly.

Water supply can be a problem in Las Vegas for multiple reasons yet most of the time it has something to do with the hotels maintenance and this is exactly what one of our readers experienced last week.

ADVERTISEMENT

As relayed to me by Kevin when checking for the best rates both the MGM Grand as well as the Park MGM came out with the most attractive offers offering a $48 daily rates plus tax and resort fees. He decided to book one night at each property to try them out.

While the Park MGM stay apparently went well the MGM Grand wasn’t quite as satisfactory.

In the early morning hours there was no hot water even after letting it run for a few minutes. A few hours later the tab water tasted salty for whatever reason.

Kevin sent us a Facebook message asking how to best approach this issue and I said the best is to already call down and report the issue to a manager. At this point it would be a good opportunity to ask for the resort fee to be waived which is basically just a scam charge by most Las Vegas hotels. The front desk agreed to taking the $42 off the bill.

A short while after a manager called back to check on the guest and since there hasn’t been any improvement he apparently agreed to waive the entire night. He essentially paid nothing for the entire stay and left with a zero folio. For reference Kevin is MLife Gold based on a Hyatt status match.

I responded to the reader that the best would be to charge something from the gift shop or mini bar to the room in order to ping the account for the Hyatt stay credit. Unfortunately by the time he read this his check-out was already completed. Too bad!

I had success with receiving stay credit for Casino comped stays in Las Vegas several times as long as I charge something to my room account.

Conclusion

Our reader had a bad experience with the water supply at MGM Grand Las Vegas as his room first lacked hot water and later on it tasted strange with a very high saline level.

After reporting the issue to management they made it right and waived his overnight charges consistent of the room rate and resort fee of roughly the same value. Rather good service but of course this relies upon the guest reporting these issues to the front desk as soon as they occur.

To give the hotel a chance to correct issues I always advise to call immediately rather than just mentioning it upon checkout.

A massive crowd packed the MGM Grand Garden Arena Saturday to see elite boxer Canelo Alvarez who has been part of three of the top grossing boxing gates in Las Vegas.

Attendance was announced at 16586 which saw Canelo defeat Caleb Plant via TKO in the 11th round thanks to a powerful barrage of left jabs and body shots that put Plant down halfway through the round. Canelo is now the first undisputed boxer at 168 pounds with all four belts that will be headed back to Mexico with him. It’s good to be king.

With fights against Floyd Mayweather and two with Gennady Golovkin in Las Vegas the Mexican superstar has ascended to number one on the pound-for-pound list.

But even more important to the boxer he’s cashing in like nobody else in the sport.

Canelo is due to earn a guaranteed $40 million while also claiming 60 percent of of the pay-per-view revenues according to multiple reports. Plant is slated to earn a guaranteed $10 million plus 40 percent of the PPV proceeds.

“For my legacy this fight is huge” the 31-year-old Canelo said during his final press conference this week.

At (56-1-2 38 KOs) Alvarez picked up the WBO belt when he beat Billy Joe Saunders in a knockout earlier this year. He now is the holder of the WBA WBC WBO and The Ring belts in the super middleweight class.

With his win over the previously undefeated Plant Canelo claimed the IBF belt.

Canelo earned an estimated $35 million for beating Billy Joe Saunders in his last fight. He quickly worked his way up the financial ladder in recent years. A decade ago he made a reported $1 million for his fight against Kermit Citron. His first fight with eight-figure earnings came in 2018 when he made an estimated $15 million for his first super middleweight fight against Rocky Fielding.

Canelo opponents have done well for themselves even if they are likely to lose. Plant is making far and away his largest purse. In his last fight against Caleb Truax he made $750000 in guaranteed money. That’s nowhere near the life-changing purse he’s pocketing for tonight’s fight.

Alvarez signed a colossal $365 million deal with streaming service DAZN in 2018 under his now former promoter Golden Boy Promotion. The 11-fight deal amounted to approximately $33 million per event. At the time it was the most lucrative contract in boxing history. As these things sometimes go in boxing Canelo soon fell out with Oscar De La Hoya after eight fights and $280 million on the table. He bet on himself as an independent.

Saul nicknamed “Canelo” cinnamon in Spanish for his brownish red colored hair has steadily become the most bankable name in boxing. Whenever he shows up in Vegas swarms of international visitors follow and that means gobs of cash being spent in the city.

Of course his big Vegas introduction party was against Las Vegan Floyd Mayweather in 2013. Alvarez was one of the rising stars of boxing. Mayweather was the veteran. It could have been a passing of the torch. Instead it was classic Mayweather handing yet another excellent opponent a 12-round decision loss. That fight resulted in a loss for Alvarez in the ring but brought in 16146 and made $20003150 at the gate. It also landed in the fifth spot of the top grossing Pay-Per-View buys at 2.2 million.

Historically Showtime has been cagey about announcing PPV numbers. The network will offer live gate estimates. As for the estimated numbers for the Canelo vs Plant bout “The gate is very healthy We’re on track for somewhere between $15 and $20 million” acccording to Showtime Boxing President Stephen Espinoza.

Paying a superstar like Canelo his asking price is a worthwhile part of the cost of doing business for the network. “There’s always risks in this current market. Especially in an event like this when Canelo took a free agent approach and sort of shopped around and looked at different fights. So there was a pretty aggressive process to land the fight financially.”

“There are risks but a reasonable amount of risks” he added speaking with longtime boxing writer Lance Pugmire.

“There’s non-financial benefits as well. So even if we break even on this event having the number one fighter in the sport on your network and associated with your boxing platform we saw it with Floyd. It brings more attention and credibility and marketing value. We’ll be marketing a lot of other fights during this fight and it drives value to the network.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY2FuZWxvLWFsdmFyZXotaGlzdG9yeS1tYWtpbmctYm94aW5nLWNoYW1waW9uLWxhcy12ZWdhcy13aW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Canelo Álvarez The History-Making Boxing Champion,"All hail the king of the ring.

On Saturday night in Las Vegas The Rolling Stones were playing at a football stadium to a sold out crowd but one man was performing less than a mile away who had an entire arena and for that matter an entire nation under his thumb: Saul Canelo Álvarez.

Canelo as he's commonly known is the greatest Mexican fighter to ever live.

That's not hyperbole either as the 31-year-old bested Caleb Plant at MGM Grand Garden arena taking home the IBF title. With the win (which happened in front of Dave Chappelle Henry Golding and other sports icons) Álvarez is now just the sixth male boxer in history to hold all four titles in the same weight class from all the major boxing sanctioning bodies. He the only Mexican fighter to do so.

""The goal is to be an all-time great"" he said as 17000 fans chanted his name at MGM Grand Garden Arena on Saturday. ""I'm so proud of the journey I've taken to achieve that. I'm not going to stop until I've tried my best to reach that goal.""

After his 11th round knockout Álvarez appropriately wearing gold shorts bearing the name of sponsor Hennessy donned a matching gold crown in the center of the ring essentially signifying that he's boxing's new ruler.

Álvarez already is an all-time great and a shoo-in first-ballot hall of famer. In boxing he's beloved. In his native Mexico he's a God. And if you think Las Vegas is flashy Álvarez could give the town a run for its money. A peek through Álvarez's Instagram shows him traveling via private jets relaxing on yachts flaunting his car collection and wearing designer clothes — living the good life. On the Showtime series All Access which promoted the fight Álvarez even wore Dolce & Gabbana training shorts adorned with Swarovski crystals.

For his fight on Saturday Álvarez netted a reported $40 million. His projected career earnings could see him becoming a billionaire.

The Guadalajara Mexico native — who has Hollywood good looks and his lavish Instagram not withstanding a humble personality — has worked for what he has. He now gets to reap the rewards.

Still Álvarez is somewhat of a walking contradiction. Whereas he makes his living beating people up in high-intensity bouts he spends an increasing amount of his time surrounded by the serenity of the golf course. He recently went viral for shadow boxing Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe Calif. Having started golfing just two years ago Álvarez seems to be a natural as he's already won a tournament the BMW Charity Pro-AM professional golf tournament.

Although he's got many fights left in him Álvarez has already made it publicly known that he intends to retire from boxing at the age of 37 so that he can golf everyday.

There's also the other side of the elite athlete the family side. A father to three daughters and a son Álvarez recently spoke to Lili Emily and Gloria Estefan on Red Table Talk: The Estefans about separating the family man from the bruiser.

""I'm not sure how I've done it but I know how to separate one from the other"" he said. ""And when I get into the ring I leave everything else behind.""

It began in the 1970s when The Eight Samurai — Intel Robert Bosch Clarion Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Hewlett-Packard (HP) (now Keysight Technologies and Agilent Technologies) Litronix (now Osram Opto Semiconductors) Hitachi (now Renesas Electronics) and National Semiconductor — established their operations in Penang.

As the E&E sector continues to grow with the adoption of new innovative and advanced technology the multinational corporations (MNCs) have created opportunities for other mid- and downstream players as well as local companies that provide supporting activities.

That explains why Malaysian semiconductor-related players are particularly strong in the area of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) and automated test equipment (ATE) as their founders and CEOs were trained by the MNCs in Penang.

Over the years Penang or more specifically Bayan Lepas has evolved into a regional electronics manufacturing hub.

However the narrative may be changing as Batu Kawan has emerged in recent years as a strong E&E cluster. Not only is the Batu Kawan Industrial Park (BKIP) expected to replicate the success story of Bayan Lepas it may even outshine its 50-year-old counterpart.

Located off Seberang Perai on the mainland of Penang Batu Kawan is intended to be the state’s third satellite town after Bayan Baru and Seberang Jaya. But does it have what it takes to become the Silicon Valley of the East 2.0?

There is no better person to ask than Invest-in-Penang Bhd CEO Datuk Loo Lee Lian who has been promoting investments in the state since 2010.

By HJBC -- Shutterstock

I feel sure there are many American workers who have put the whistle in their mouths like former Facebook employee Frances Haugen but been too afraid to blow it.

I feel equally sure that after I tell you what's coming you'll be more reluctant even to put the whistle in your mouth.

It may be that you think your employer is doing evil unspeakable or merely unpleasant or illegal things. But it may equally be that you're less a whistleblower and more tending toward the unpleasant untrustworthy or even illegal yourself.

Also: There's been a big rise in monitoring workers at home. We should all be worried

With blessed coincidence Microsoft is preparing a couple of little updates that may curb employee rulebreaking enthusiasm.

Yes this news again comes courtesy of Microsoft's roadmap service where Redmond prepares you for the joys to come.

This time there are a couple of joys.

The first is headlined: ""Microsoft 365 compliance center: Insider risk management -- Increased visibility on browsers.""

It all sounded wonderful until you those last four words didn't it? For this is the roadmap for administrators. And when you give a kindly administrator ""increased visibility on browsers"" you can feel sure this means an elevated level of surveillance of what employees are typing into those browsers.

In this case Microsoft is targeting ""risky activity."" Which presumably has some sort of definition. It offers a link to its compliance center where the very first sentence has whistleblower built in: ""Web browsers are often used by users to access both sensitive and non-sensitive files within an organization.""

And what is the compliance center monitoring? Why ""files copied to personal cloud storage files printed to local or network devices files transferred or copied to a network share files copied to USB devices.""

You always assumed this was the case? Perhaps. But now there will be mysteriously increased visibility.

""How might this visibility be increased?"" I hear you shudder. Well there's another little roadmap update that may just may offer a clue.

This one proclaims: ""Microsoft 365 compliance center: Insider risk management -- New ML detectors.""

Yes your company will soon have extra-special robots to crawl along after you and observe your every ""risky"" action. It's not enough to have increased visibility on browsers. You must also have Machine Learning constantly alert for someone revealing your lunch schedule.

Microsoft offers a link to its Insider Risk Management page. This enjoys some delicious phrasing: ""Customers acknowledge insights related to the individual user's behavior character or performance materially related to employment can be calculated by the administrator and made available to others in the organization.""

Yes even your character is being examined here.

In one sense this is all understandable. The easier it gets for employees to behave in even marginally nefarious ways the more there has to be security to prevent them from doing it.

The more that cyber weaknesses exist the more someone might want to exploit them.

Ultimately of course it's another small representation of the complete lack of trust among humans -- and especially between management and employees. Technology because of its immediacy and ubiquity has exacerbated that.

The more companies descend spy software upon their employees -- especially employees working from home -- the less trust can exist between those who work and those who manage.

The more companies want to follow every single moment of their employees' working lives -- and even non-working lives -- the less it feels like we're all in this together.

There's a certain symbolism of course in Microsoft 365 following you around 365 days a year.

This article explains how to customize image color or recolor options in Microsoft Office or Microsoft 365 giving you greater control over saturation tone and transparency. Instructions cover Microsoft Office (Word Excel PowerPoint) 2019 2016 2013 Microsoft 365 and Office for Mac.

Changing Image Color in Microsoft Office or Microsoft 365

When you want to fix or change the color of a picture or apply a sepia or grayscale effect follow these steps:



Open the Microsoft program as well as a document with images inserted. If you do not yet have images inserted go to Insert > Illustrations select either Pictures or Online Pictures. To change the color you can use the pre-made correction presets or use Picture Color Options for fine-tuning. (Shown in step 7.) The presets you see will vary depending on which program and version you are working in but should include Saturation Color Tone and Recolor. Saturation refers to the depth of color applied to your image. Notice how these presets range across a spectrum of color depths. If you see one that would work well for your project select it here among values between 0% and 400%. Color Tone refers to the warmth or coolness of the image color and this preset also offers choices along a spectrum. You will notice these values have different temperature ratings denoting how warm or cool the image tone is. Recolor refers to a color wash placed over an image. This means your image will be treated as black and white but with other options for the ""white"". It means the fill or background color as well as some tones in the line art itself will take on that color. Presets typically include Sepia Grayscale Washout and other options. Alternatively select Color > Picture Color Options. Adjust the Saturation using the dial or numerical input. Adjust the Color Tone using the dial or numerical input remembering that Color Tone is adjusted in terms of temperature and refers to how warm or cool the image hues appear. If you wish Recolor the entire image using the drop-down menu.

Unfortunately most network systems need to be easy to access and exceptionally secure at the same time. These two paradoxical necessities all too often butt heads and when administrators settle for the ease of use cybersecurity goes out the door leaving a system open to nefarious operators and executable programs.

In a Microsoft Technical Document “Active Directory Domain Services Overview (AD/DS)” which applies to Windows Servers 2022 going back to 2012 the second paragraph says: “Active Directory (AD) stores information about objects on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use. Active Directory uses a structured data store as the basis for a logical hierarchical organization of directory information.”

In the fourth paragraph the document states: “Security is integrated with Active Directory through logon authentication and access control to objects in the directory. With a single network logon administrators can manage directory data and organization throughout their network and authorized network users can access resources anywhere on the network. Policy-based administration eases the management of even the most complex network.”

Opening the door to your network

Active Directory is known as holding ‘the keys to the kingdom’ which is why BlackMatter and other nefarious actors have been targeting Active Directory in order to leverage the information within it so bad actors can spread their ransomware according to Derek Melber chief technology & security strategist Tenable. “By compromising Active Directory bad actors can encrypt the data and effectively hold organizations and their systems hostage.”

As an aside BleepingComputer.com reported on November 3 2021 that the BlackMatter ransomware group is shutting down “after members have gone missing and increased pressure by law enforcement.” Unfortunately BlackMatter victims are not off the hook as its infrastructure is still live and according to BleepingComputer.com BlackMatter’s affiliates are moving victims to the LockBit ransomware negotiation site. So whether it’s BlackMatter or another ransomware actor Active Directory is—and will continue to be—under attack by nefarious actors.

How BlackMatter and nefarious actors work Active Directory

BlackMatter leverages the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to access the Active Directory to discover all hosts on the network. BlackMatter then remotely encrypts the hosts and shared drives as they are found adds Melber.

“BlackMatter enumerates not only computers but also users service accounts groups and more to find other attack paths that lead to privilege escalation” says Melber. This means that the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) needs to be implemented password reuse is prohibited privileged accounts from Active Directory are not allowed to log on to workstations or servers and resources (shared folders) are secured and removed if not needed.

Once bad actors have compromised Active Directory it’s game over says Melber. Organizations particularly critical infrastructure providers need to secure their Active Directory environments to cut the attack path off from the very beginning.

Securing your network

Securing AD in a Microsoft Domain can seem like an oxymoron. Can you actually have ease-of-access and use for those who need access and secure AD at the same time? Wouldn’t—though not convenient—a simple file server with dedicated user shares in a peer-to-peer network be safer—where no user logins are stored on one or more servers in an AD network? Maybe that would be practical for a simple small office network but certainly not at enterprise scale. And while a Linux-based server system may seem more secure to some people if the Linux system is also running LDAP and SMB protocols to be compatible with Microsoft AD networks then it hardly matters—or so it would seem.

To work through some of these AD conundrums I asked Melber for some pointers on securing AD-based networks and detecting and preventing interlopers from entering the system—because once inside the network these adversaries could easily work themselves into control networks that may be interconnected to the business system.

FE: OK let’s start with the basic question. Can you actually have ease of use/access and rock-solid cybersecurity in a Microsoft AD/DS network?

Derek Melber: Rock-solid security is possible but it requires dedicated and continuous work. AD is incredibly complex and as a result it’s typically under-managed and security holes are left open. It’s a herculean task to keep on top of all the administrators systems group accounts resource permissions and trust relationships. The directory also is constantly changing through day-to-day operations making it even harder to manage and know if a change opened up an attack path. AD has numerous configuration options and settings to accommodate innumerable situations for user access and permissions which means even more opportunities for oversights and discrepancies to be taken advantage of by attackers.

With all of that in mind in order to feel comfortable about your security posture you must clean up any misconfigurations that exist in AD now and then constantly monitor and analyze new changes to ensure no new attack paths have opened up.

FE: CISA in its advice to network admins pointed out steps to make AD more secure but at the same time these steps seem to limit ease of use—especially for admins. What are your basic recommendations for securing an AD network?

Melber: As I mentioned keeping AD secure can be complicated and require dedication. I recommend kicking off the process by breaking things down—ensure all of the aspects of AD (users attributes groups etc.) are secured to give yourself digestible tasks to work with. Focusing on both lateral movement and privilege escalation is a good place to start. This means that endpoints should be protected with LAPS and MFA. Also you should supplement the MFAs by also using the principle of least privilege across all endpoints. This prevents lateral movement blocks default administration and denies access where necessary. For privilege escalation this means that all user and group accounts that have privileges in AD need to be secured and ensure there is no configuration drift.

FE: If you’re running Linux servers configured for LDAP and SMB in an AD network you have the same AD issues correct? Or would Linux servers be a better choice?

Melber: If AD is involved this is the issue. The main issues with AD are within the AD database not the OS itself. So if Windows or Linux is used that is really not a factor. Honestly Linux has many vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that have led to exploits over the years too. If a human can build it a human can break it!

FE: Would Linux file shares formatted in ext4 be any safer than NTFS in an AD/SMB network? That is to say if Linux ext4 drives are accessible through SMB then they look just like Windows shares making them vulnerable too. Correct?

Melber: I don’t see NTFS as the issue. Sure SMB has been exploited but again it is SMB not the OS that the files are located on. Attackers are not going after the ACL or permission they are attacking objects to gain privileges or credentials so they can access resources freely regardless of where they are stored.

FE: Would the use of advanced routers/firewalls and managed switches help to establish security? If so how would you implement them?

Melber: Security is not a point solution but a layering. Routers/firewalls and managed switches are part of that but not really related to AD.

FE: What detection tools (hardware and/or software) are available to spot nefarious activity on an AD network? Are these systems using AI technologies to spot activities that don’t belong?

Melber: “Detection” is a blanket word. Let’s break this down into a few parts. First detection is required within AD to know if a setting or configuration (which is needed) is weak and can be exploited. This is the preventative part of AD security. Second there is detection of an attack. Against AD there are some advanced attacks that are very difficult to detect: DCSync DCShadow Golden Ticket etc. Unfortunately most tools that can detect issues and attacks in AD require agents on every domain controller and usually require privileges. The only solution on the market that requires no agents and no privileges (read only access) is Tenable.ad.

FE: Often hackers have been able to be on a network for weeks at a time without being noticed. How do you find them? How do you figure out how they broke into the network in the first place? When and how do you lock them out of the network?

Melber: Attackers often only need to compromise one machine in a network to get access to AD and from there they can run rampant. They can leapfrog between accounts until they get administrative control and then they can pose as legitimate IT users authenticate using valid credentials create new accounts change user access controls escalate privileges and move from on-premise to Azure Active Directory in the cloud — all without being detected because they appear to be legitimate trusted users.

In order to find them you must monitor for malicious and abnormal activity. This means keeping an eye out for attackers exploiting misconfigurations and impersonating accounts/users. Oftentimes these changes appear like normal behavior to the naked eye so ensuring your team is equipped to identify them is of the utmost importance. Attacks also must be monitored. From simple methods like password spraying to more advanced methods like DCShadow they must be addressed immediately to prevent backdooring.

Regardless of the method or level of sophistication speed is crucial when monitoring and remediating this network activity.

Most organizations find out about a breach by ending up with all of their data being encrypted by ransomware.

FE: What training should network administrators have to make their AD networks safer from outside penetration?

Melber: AD is used in most organizations (90 percent of the Fortune 1000) providing attackers the proverbial keys to the kingdom. It’s much more serious than a compromised endpoint and more prone to attack due to the volume of misconfigurations and constant changes within the directory. Yet most IT departments are neglecting its security. Until organizations make it a priority to harden AD we’ll be seeing attackers using it as a key resource in their toolkit just like they did with the SolarWinds attack. The stakes for any organization are too high not to address the security issues in Active Directory the intelligence at the core of their IT infrastructure.

As for training every organization needs to have an AD admin that is educated on the finer aspects of AD and security. Not knowing can hurt you! This can be helped with solutions that give the AD administrators insights into misconfigurations why they are an issue and how to remediate them. Tenable.ad is full of insights and guidance for administrators and security professionals.

FE: What training should network users have to keep them and their networks safe from nefarious groups like BlackMatter?

Melber: This takes a full team to protect against any allied group. These groups are looking to enter at any point so every aspect of the network and all devices need to be patched and configured in a secure fashion. It is not training as much as ensuring that every aspect of the network is understood and measures are taken to secure the entry points.

FE: How do you determine if these network interlopers have wandered into controls networks? Do you have any recommendations on protecting controls networks from business networks? What about one-way data such that it travels only from controls to business systems?

Melber: Operation technology (OT) networks are now being tied to AD for control and management purposes. OT and AD both have a similar makeup in that they can have vulnerabilities and misconfigurations so both need constant attention. If both OT and AD are given the attention they deserve the attackers will have a smaller attack surface and movement between them will be negated. However if either is left open and not secured then exploitation and movement between them will be quite easy.

Detection of malicious actors in AD and OT are the same. Malicious changes unwanted changes and attacks need to be monitored and detected constantly and automatically. If a bad actor is already in OT or AD then it is nearly impossible to know where backdoors were placed.

Due to the way networks work one-way communications can be difficult but not impossible. However when it comes to AD devices need to talk to AD and AD needs to send info to devices. So two-way communication is nearly required.

The main takeaway: People who are immunocompromised and received a two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) can now get an additional third dose as part of the vaccine series. This applies to immunocompromised people 12 and older who received the Pfizer vaccine and people 18 and older who received the Moderna vaccine. Right now immunocompromised people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine cannot get an additional vaccine dose under these recommendations though this may change as more research becomes available.

Many people in the CreakyJoints and Global Healthy Living Foundation (GHLF) community acted swiftly to get the third dose. In a recent poll of our GHLF COVID-19 Patient Support Program which includes immunocompromised and high-risk patients among 2652 respondents 53 percent said that they have already received the third dose. Among those who have not yet received it 91 percent said they planned to.

Read more here about what it was like for those in our community who received the third COVID-19 vaccine dose.

We know there are many questions about who qualifies for an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose which vaccine to get what to expect with side effects and more. Here are answers based on what we know so far — we will update this resource as more information becomes available.

Who Is Considered Immunocompromised and Should Get the Additional Vaccine Dose?

The CDC includes a list of medical conditions and treatments that it considers “moderately and severely immunocompromised.” This includes people who have:

Been receiving treatment for cancer (tumors or blood cancers)

Received an organ transplant and are taking medication to suppress the immune system

Received a stem cell transplant within the last two years or are taking medication to suppress the immune system

Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g. DiGeorge Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes)

Advanced or untreated HIV infection

Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant or medications including therapies such as methotrexate rituximab mycophenolate and certain biologic medications

People with inflammatory and autoimmune conditions often take many different medications that can be considered immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory (meaning it has an effect on the way the immune system functions).

Researchers have been studying how different types of immunosuppressive medications affect the immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine and studies show that the response can vary widely by type of medication. For example the treatment rituximab (Rituxan) — used for rheumatoid arthritis and certain other rheumatic conditions — has a significant impact on the immune response. Methotrexate mycophenolate and high-dose corticosteroids also diminish the immune response. But other biologics don’t seem to have as much of an effect.

That said the American College of Rheumatology recommends that rheumatology patients on immunosuppressive and immunomodulating therapies get the third vaccine dose.

It is not recommended to get antibody testing to see how you may have responded to the previous doses of the vaccine. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about whether your medications or medical conditions make you eligible for an additional vaccine dose.

The CDC said it is not necessary to show proof of your medications or medical condition to get the third COVID-19 vaccine dose. Additional screening questions will be asked at the vaccination site to make sure you have an immunocompromising condition or treatment.

Why Is a Third Dose Needed for the Immunocompromised?

The CDC made this change in the vaccine regimen for immunocompromised people for three main reasons:

They are more likely to get severely sick from COVID-19 (though risks and complications can vary widely — remember being “immunocompromised” is a very broad definition)

They are likely to have a reduced antibody levels from the original COVID-19 vaccine series compared to non-immunocompromised people

They may be more likely to transmit the virus to others

Immunocompromised patients are more likely to have breakthrough infections and complications from those breakthrough infections. Research shows that about 40 to 44 percent of hospitalized breakthrough cases in the U.S. are in immunocompromised people according to CDC data.

The studies that have looked at antibody levels in people who have received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine have shown varying results based on the type of immunocompromising condition. For example people taking medication after an organ transplant to prevent rejection tend to have a much lower antibody response than people taking other immunosuppressive therapies say for autoimmune conditions. But on the whole studies show that vaccine effectiveness in immunocompromised people after receiving the second dose ranges from 59 to 72 percent compared with 90 to 94 percent in people who are not immunocompromised.

The good news is that recent research has shown that a third vaccine dose can help boost the immune response. In a study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine organ transplant recipients were randomized to get a third dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine two months after their second dose or a placebo. More than half (55 percent) of those who got the additional dose had a robust antibody response one month later compared to only 18 percent in the placebo group.

A separate study from France 101 organ transplant patients received a third dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The proportion of people with antibodies increased from 40 percent before the third dose to 68 percent four weeks later.

In summarizing the research available so far the CDC says that among immunocompromised people who had no detectable antibody response to the original two-dose vaccine from Pfizer or Moderna 33 to 50 percent developed a response after a third dose.

However keep in mind that a third dose is not a bulletproof shield against COVID-19 and your response will depend on your medical condition and medications. It’s important to still follow precautions like wearing a mask indoors and avoiding crowds (more on this below).

A Third COVID-19 Vaccine Dose vs. a Booster Shot: What’s the Difference?

The additional third dose for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that is now recommended for immunocompromised people is NOT the same as a booster shot and it’s important to understand the distinction.

Additional or Third Dose

An additional dose of a vaccine is given when the initial immune response following a primary vaccine series is likely to be insufficient. Different studies in various groups of immunocompromised patients (from organ transplant recipients to people with autoimmune conditions) have shown that that immunocompromised people have a slightly lower antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine which means they are not as protected against COVID-19 as the general population.

The CDC emphasized that the additional dose is now part of the usual COVID-19 vaccination regimen for severely immunocompromised people.

Booster Dose

A booster shot on the other hand is given when an initial sufficient immune response to a primary vaccine series wanes over time. Also known as a durability booster this would be available to the general population. It’s possible that immunocompromised patients could get both a third vaccine dose as part of the regular vaccine series and a booster dose in the future.

Though the CDC and FDA have yet to determine if and when booster shots will be recommended they noted that COVID-19 vaccine booster shots would likely first be given to at-risk adult populations. This includes:

Adults age 65 and older

Long-term care facility residents

Health care workers

Which Vaccines Will Be Given as Third COVID-19 Vaccine Doses?

As of now the emergency use authorization for the additional dose only applies to people who received an mRNA vaccine which includes:

Pfizer (available to people ages 12 and older)

(available to people ages 12 and older) Moderna (available to people 18 and older)

This means that if you are immunocompromised and received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine it is not recommended that you get an additional dose of any other vaccine at this time. That’s because “there is not enough data at this time to determine whether immunocompromised people who received the Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine also have an improved antibody response following an additional dose of the same vaccine” according to the CDC.

CDC and FDA officials indicated they are actively studying this issue and expect to have an update for people who receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine soon. The J&J vaccine has been used far less than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines but it’s not known how many immunocompromised people are affected by this.

Does Your Third COVID-19 Vaccine Dose Have to Be the Same as Your First Two?

Ideally yes. The CDC recommends that people try to match the version of their additional vaccine dose to their initial vaccine dose. (If you got Pfizer for your first two vaccines you should get Pfizer for your third.) But if that’s not feasible the CDC said mixing-and-matching the mRNA vaccines is permitted for the third dose.

Do You Need to Adjust Your Immunosuppressive Medication Regimen Around the Third Dose?

The American College of Rheumatology recently updated its COVID-19 vaccine guidance for getting the third dose and possibly temporarily stopping certain medications to help improve your immune system’s response to the vaccine. The main takeaways are:

Hold immunomodulating or immunosuppressive medications (except for glucocorticoids and most biologics) for 1-2 weeks after the third vaccine dose assuming disease activity allows. Because holding these medications for a week or two should not put most patients at risk for a flare experts recommend this to help your body mount a robust response to the vaccine

Discuss holding most biologics including TNF inhibitors and interleukin inhibitors with your doctor. The ACR task force assigned to updating the guidance was mixed about whether to advise for or against holding certain biologics. Data suggests that people on these medications do not have a dramatically reduced response to the COVID-19 vaccine. Some doctors may recommend you temporarily hold them out of an abundance of caution; maybe there’s a chance doing so could increase your response slightly. Others may recommend that you continue to take them because stopping them could impact your risk of a flare and there is unlikely to be a big impact on vaccine response.

Discuss timing around rituximab with your doctor. This medication gets rid of B cells circulating in your blood to reduce inflammation but B cells are needed to generate an immune system response to vaccines. Because of this experts recommend getting the third vaccine dose close to your NEXT rituximab dose (when B cells would be highest) in order to garner a better response to the vaccine.

You can read more here about the updated ACR COVID-19 vaccine guidance for people with autoimmune or inflammatory rheumatic disease.

Whether or not you should temporarily stop your medication depends on many factors including how well-controlled your underlying condition is.

Don’t make any changes to your medication regimen before or after getting the third COVID-19 vaccine dose without first asking your doctor.

Will You Have Side Effects from the Third COVID-19 Vaccine Dose?

Initial studies suggest that side effects from the third dose will be similar to those from the first two doses. The CDC says that fatigue and pain at the injection site were the most commonly reported side effects and overall most symptoms were mild to moderate.

The CDC says there is “limited information about the risks of receiving an additional dose of vaccine and the safety efficacy and benefit of additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine in immunocompromised people continues to be evaluated.”

The most common COVID-19 vaccine side effects which have been reported to be more frequent and more severe following the second dose include:

Pain in the arm where you got the shot

Swelling in the arm where you got the shot

Fever

Chills

Fatigue

Headache

So far the side effects from the third COVID-19 vaccine dose have varied among immunocompromised patients.

CreakyJoints asked community members who received their additional dose what the experience was like. Rebecca G. said she “ran a fever had body aches and got a terrible headache with nausea” while Krista K. said she “just generally felt yucky and very tired.”

It’s important to be aware of the risks of serious side effects though these are rare.

Experts will be monitoring the rollout closely and the CDC’s vaccine monitoring app called V-safe will be amended so users can share information about symptoms and side effects after receiving the third dose.

In an Israeli survey of 4500 people who received a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine 88 percent of respondents said that in the days after receiving the third shot they felt “similar or better” to how they felt after the second shot. Thirty-one percent reported experiencing some side effect; soreness at the injection site was most common Reuters reported.

“I suspect that the side effects from the third dose will be very similar to those seen with earlier doses” says infectious disease physician Amesh A. Adalja MD a Senior Scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “People should see what symptoms develop and have some acetaminophen or ibuprofen handy. They also may not want to schedule anything too strenuous the day after the vaccination.”

Where Do You Get the Third COVID-19 Vaccine Dose?

You should be able to get the third vaccine dose wherever other mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) vaccines are available. The CDC recommends you:

Search vaccines.gov

Text your ZIP code to 438829

Call 1-800-232-0233 to find locations near you

You can also contact your local pharmacy to see if vaccination walk-ins or appointments are available or contact your state or local health department for more information.

Though you will need to show proof of prior vaccination the CDC notes that people will not be required to show proof of a medical condition in order to receive a third dose. They simply have to attest to their immunocompromised status.

Staying Safe and Continuing to Take Precautions

Though a third COVID-19 vaccine dose will likely help immunocompromised people garner more protection against the coronavirus that doesn’t mean you should let your guard down when it comes to other precautions. The CDC still urges immunocompromised people to practice mitigation efforts even after receiving their additional COVID-19 vaccine dose. This means:

Wearing a mask in public settings

Maintaining a social distance of six feet from those who do not live with you

Avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces

Washing or sanitizing your hands frequently

When spending time with loved ones remember that outdoors is safer than indoors

Additionally per the CDC’s recent recommendations fully vaccinated people who have a known exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be tested three to five days after exposure and wear a mask in public indoor settings for 14 days or until they receive a negative test result. If you are exposed to COVID-19 talk to your health care provider about getting monoclonal antibody treatment which was recently approved to treat and prevent COVID-19 post-exposure in immunocompromised people.

Encourage family members coworkers friends and community members to get vaccinated if they’re eligible and haven’t done so. Here’s how to talk to loved ones about getting the vaccine.

As the Delta variant spreads and daily COVID cases increase it is important to be vigilant in your efforts to remain safe and protected. Getting the third COVID-19 vaccine dose is an important step if you’re immunocompromised.

""We have been expecting a material slowdown in both economic and earnings growth amid a mid cycle transition"" he wrote in a recent note to clients. ""The Delta variant is not the primary reason why growth has slowed in our view. Instead we think it's simply a more dramatic mid cycle transition than normal given the speed and velocity of the recovery so far.""

He also writes that the supply chain problems will last longer than most traders expect and demand from consumers is going to be weaker than they believe.

""We think the growth slowdown will be worse and last longer than expected — i.e. well into the first half of 2022 as the payback in demand arrives with the sharp y/y decline in personal disposable income"" he said.

It's well-known that Americans built up a lot of savings during COVID thanks to stimulus payments and the absence of many forms of non-streaming entertainment and leisure. While some prognosticators think those savings will keep the economy afloat for a while Wilson says the money has been spent and consumers are roughly back to pre-pandemic savings levels now.

He added that a survey by National Public Radio and Harvard found that 59% of households with less than $50000 in annual income reported severe financial problems in the last few months while 38% of all households said the same.

That helps explain a recent dip in consumer confidence and it could mean people are about to spend far less than investors think they will. Wilson suggests that that's a setup for economic and stock market disappointment even before factoring in the supply chain issues and other problems.

""A key message from us over the next several weeks is to stay selective and to stay more defensive in terms of positioning"" Wilson wrote. ""We continue to like relatively reasonably priced Software over Hardware and Semis in Tech Services over Goods in Discretionary Financials and Healthcare.""

Spencer had called out middle-aged father who apparently hurl abuse at him on social media claiming their kids must be ashamed of their troll dad.

Spencer who has over 67000 followers on Twitter wrote: “Not that it bothers me but pretty sad how most people who abuse me on here are middle aged with kids and stuff. Kids must be so ashamed”.

His tweet didn’t go down too well with some with one user who can be seen posing with who could be assumed to be his children in his profile picture replying: “So people with a fairly decent amount of life experience then?”

Others took the opportunity to take swipes at Spencer’s father Piers.

A few users made indirect remarks to Spencer suggesting that he is spoiled.

One said: “It's because you are the ‘Prince Andrew’ or ‘Mark Thatcher’ of the Morgans.”

Spencer in the past has been branded ""privileged brat"" for saying he can't understand why so many people are ""complaining"" about having their salaries reduced during the pandemic.

In a past tweet Spencer wrote: ""How can anyone complain about a 20% salary reduction right now? Surely you are saving more than that from doing nothing anyway"".

The RCMP originally planned to start rolling out cameras by late 2021 — but it still hasn't awarded a contract.

""The exact timeline for the body worn camera rollout will be confirmed once a vendor is selected"" said RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Caroline Duval.

Back in 2020 Commissioner Brenda Lucki — responding to multiple controversies involving Mounties' use of force and allegations of systemic racism — agreed to outfit members with body-worn cameras and launch a digital evidence management system.

Citing ""an agile procurement process"" Duval said three companies — Axon Public Safety Canada Inc. Getac Video Solutions Ltd. and Motorola Solutions Canada Inc. — are competing for the contract.

""The RCMP and [Public Services and Procurement Canada] are engaged in a process to review and refine requirements with the three above noted vendors"" she said.

""Once complete a request for proposal will be launched. The field test will begin once the vendor is selected.""

The RCMP's original plan was to first introduce the cameras in selected rural urban and remote communities before issuing them to all officers who interact with the public.

While body-worn cameras have been widely embraced as a tool to improve police accountability some experts have said there isn't enough evidence to prove they improve policing.

Mounties in Nunavut wore cameras for six months as part of a pilot project; the detachment said officers recorded more than 3500 videos resulting from approximately 5000 calls. The RCMP is now evaluating that project.

The union representing thousands of boots-the-ground RCMP officers has said it supports the use of body-worn cameras but wants clearer guidelines on when they can be turned off.

The Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer reported that outfitting RCMP officers with body-worn cameras at 700 detachments will cost about $131 million over five years.",,,,,,,,,,,,

First of all give us a sense of the challenge you face. I think thank you for having me and I think one of the big challenges for India right now is really the fact that sustainability and ESG is in its extremely nascent stages. And just the awareness and understanding is what a company like ours is trying to do particularly in the world. Escape. You have a lot of ESG funds. Yes. If islands have primarily been fund managers who will try to take the concept of sustainability and ESG to investors. But I think the big shift that we're now going to see is how asset owners really push and push the agenda and the envelope in terms of making sure that the investments that we make. Are they in fact in investing companies and companies that are really staying true to the ESG principles. Oh indeed. And you know it's about risk reward. And how would you actually then get to make the reward that much more tantalizing I suppose. I think the good news is that when you look at the data and I think everyone always thinks that if you invest through ESG are you necessarily compromising your returns. Because in terms of the risk reward tradeoff. What's interesting to note is that when you look at the MSCI ESG leaders index data which was constituted in September of 2007 and you compare that with the MSCI India index you actually see a 400 basis points better performance on the ESG leaders as compared to just the regular MSCI index. So I think what we're trying to say is that if you do invest on the lines of ESG you are actually going to generate better returns in the longer term. And India data actually does prove that. So Mia if you believe the likes of Mark CARNEY he says that about a trillion dollars of assets will be committed to net zero. I'm wondering what kind of traction are you seeing in India itself. I think when you look at the entire issue around climate climate action what we're seeing is India has committed a cop 26 to be net zero by 2070. I think that's putting a huge stake in the ground for India. And ultimately our entire the way in which we're going to have to look at this is really around mitigation and adaptability of ground mitigation. There is a huge amount of work which is really around what is it that we can electrify and electrify everything that we can. And the other is really going to be around how do we decarbonise the grid. And here there is a huge push on India aside in order to look at this entire green hydrogen emission. The green hydrogen emission is really where several industrial houses are really taking up the challenge to say how is it that I can use renewable energy. Because again one of the pledges we've done at COP 26 is just say that we are going to have almost 500 gigawatts is going to be renewables by 2030 and we're going to have 50 percent of our energy beaten on fossil fuel based. Now those are fairly big big statements to make. What's interesting also is that if you looked at something someone like the Indian Railways the Indian Railways has actually said that they're going to be net zero by 2030. We have one of the largest railway systems in in the CAC in the globe. And the fact that the Indian Railways itself is committing to that and electrifying other trucks and other ways really means that India is taking this extremely seriously. So somehow having said that I'm wondering how you're deploying your clients money right now. Which sectors. Which companies in particular. I think it's still early days hasn't it. I think we still haven't got enough happening in terms of companies that are really moving towards or let me say the NSA segment. I think there are quite a few which are the larger corporates which are focusing on this. But the NSA is still something a segment that we need to look at a little bit more closely. What's going to be important. Just subsidies. And today what you do see is the subsidies that are provided for Indian companies. If you look at the coal and tomo power you actually see subsidies are actually 35 percent lower than it is for renewable energy companies. So these are some of the policy changes that will need to happen in order for us to be able to make sure that companies are incentivized in terms of where we're looking at investments. We think one of the large megatrends that's going to play out for India is going to be renewables. The question is we still haven't found enough companies which were able to actually make investments into at this point in time. But I hope that given the commitments we've made at COP 26 that's really going to change and policy is going to dictate companies that really step up to this area. So you're looking at just ISG itself and there's a lot of research that showed the companies which have good ESG scores as you do better in terms of how much you have in return in terms of returns. Now the cataloging regulator has introduced the B R S I think that's called the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report here. What are your thoughts on that. I think it's a great initiative which has been brought out by the regulator. We did have something known as the B R the Business Responsibility Report which was started by a regulator in 2013 14. Now that's morphed into the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report. This is now mandated across the top thousand listed companies in India. It is voluntary for this financial year. By 22 it is mandatory from FII 23. What's also interesting is that the regulator said that has actually provided guidance on the kind of formatting and the reporting that you need to actually have in the BRW are what's now. This is really resulted in some ways that boards are now looking at this space much much more closely. ESG has now become a board driven agenda. You have several listed companies which have actually set up ESG committees. The fact that you have data which is available to allow investors like us to actually look at what that data is saying and then to make judgment calls in terms of which of the companies we want to back is really going to be quite quite transfer literary in terms of what we're going to see. What is going to be interesting also though is that there are some companies which are naturally in industries or spaces which may be had just a higher environmental issues or higher social issues. How are we going to see what these companies bring out is going to be important.",,,,,,,,,,,,

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20 2021

Matt Frankel: I'll give you an overview of what PayPal does real quick. Everyone knows what they do they're a payment processor. They have grown tremendously. They're are a big company almost a $300 billion market cap they're roughly eight times the size of Pinterest (NYSE: PINS). This is definitely a manageable acquisition for them. It's not even as dilutive as say Square (NYSE: SQ) acquiring Afterpay in stock. They have 403 million active users. Those active users make 4.7 billion transactions individual purchases on PayPal's platform every quarter.

In the second quarter PayPal's payment volume was $1.2 trillion on an annualized basis. There's over $1 trillion flowing through PayPal's ecosystem. Venmo is the biggest growth area of the business I give Venmo payments all the time. We own a vacation rental and when friends stay there sometimes they'll Venmo me for some of the cost. That's growing really rapidly but it's still a pretty small part of PayPal's business $58 billion out of $311 billion in payment volume in the second quarter.

Growth is still very very good. The pandemic accelerated the digital payments transformation which is why PayPal's payment volume grew 40% year over year in the last quarter. Unlike a lot of these big fintech companies PayPal is consistently profitable. PayPal is expected to generate about $5 billion in free cash flow this year alone. Most acquisitions PayPal has made have been in cash and without taking out debt because the company is generating money that it's using to acquire businesses. Honey is the big recent example the discount shopping platform. That's the basics of the business. It started out as a subsidiary of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) not that long ago. Now eBay is down to just 4% of PayPal's revenue. A lot of big catalysts in PayPal's business.

The analysis is based on recently filed proxy statements and complemented by the review of organizational documents (including articles of incorporation bylaws corporate governance principles board committee charters and other corporate policies made available in the Investor Relations section of companies’ websites).

The project is conducted by The Conference Board and ESG data analytics firm ESGAUGE in collaboration with Debevoise & Plimpton the KPMG Board Leadership Center Russell Reynolds Associates and the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.

The following are the key findings and insights.

For the first time in our annual analysis of proxy statements in 2021 the majority of S&P 500 companies have disclosed the racial (ethnic) makeup of their boards. According to the disclosure available boards remain overwhelmingly white with some business sectors disclosing far more racial diversity than others. This is also true for newly elected directors for which demographic information is made public—less than one-fourth of them are non-white. Companies should consider committing to a multi-year board succession plan where the search for strategic skills and expertise is accompanied by a sustained focus on diversity. They should also investigate best practices on the integration of diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) metrics into senior executives’ incentive plans and continue to improve disclosure of board racial and ethnic diversity.

Corporate disclosure of the racial (ethnic) diversity of board of directors has grown exponentially in the last couple of years. According to proxy statements filed as of June 30 2021 for the first time a majority of S&P 500 companies (59 percent) included this type of information which is based on self-disclosure by individual directors; the figure was 24 percent last year 15 percent in 2019 and a mere 3.1 percent in 2016. Unlike other governance disclosure practices which typically take years to extend to market segments beyond the large group of companies that compose the S&P 500 index the practice of providing more granular disclosure on the diversity makeup of corporate boards is rapidly expanding to the S&P MidCap 400 and the Russell 3000. In the 2021 proxy season 32.6 percent of S&P MidCap 400 companies and 26.9 percent of the Russell 3000 companies included information on the racial (ethnic) composition of their board.

Among S&P 500 companies that disclose their directors’ race (ethnicity) 76.4 percent self-identify as white 13.3 percent as African American 5.3 percent as Latinx or Hispanic and 4.1 percent as Asian Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. The remaining 0.9 percent report a different ethnic background from those listed above. There are slightly more Asian Hawaiian or Pacific Islander directors among S&P MidCap 400 companies (5.3 percent) and in the Russell 3000 (4.9 percent). However in the S&P MidCap 400 the percentage of African American directors sitting on boards providing this type of disclosure is lower than the level of the S&P 500 or 9 percent. In the Russell 3000 it is 10.9 percent.

The Russell 3000 index breakdown reveals stark differences in disclosure practices by business sectors. For example the companies that are more likely to disclose the racial (ethnic) background of their board members are in the utilities and consumer staples sectors (50 percent and 43.8 percent respectively). In contrast only 16.7 percent of health care companies and 19.8 percent of communications services firms provide this type of public disclosure.

Among the Russell 3000 companies that provide such disclosure the highest percentage of directors who self-identify as African American is found in the utilities sector (15.1 percent) followed by the consumer staples and the communications services sectors (13 percent and 12.7 percent respectively). The lowest percentages are in the energy and materials sectors (5.2 percent and 9.2 percent respectively). Only 2.7 percent of the Russell 3000 companies in the health care sector that disclose information on their directors’ race (ethnicity) report board members who self-identify as Latinx or Hispanic. Of directors at consumer staples companies including such disclosure 8 percent self-identify as Latinx or Hispanic. Of all sectors information technology companies report the highest percentage of Asian Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (10.5 percent) while utilities companies report the lowest (2.6 percent).

The diversity analysis was complemented with a review of the population of newly elected directors in 2021. In all examined indexes of all new directors at companies that publicly shared the self-disclosure of racial (ethnic) backgrounds more than three quarters continue to be white or Caucasian. The S&P 500 had the highest percentage of newly elected African American directors so far this year or 13.6 percent compared to 11.5 percent of the Russell 3000 and only 6.8 percent of the S&P MidCap 400.

What’s ahead? Ensuring the racial (ethnic) diversity of board members will be an imperative for US public companies in the next few years as pressure from multiple stakeholders will only rise from here. In the last year alone we have witnessed a social reckoning on a scale that was not seen before. The racial justice movement has galvanized consumers and employees. It has also become a catalyst for bold actions from legislatures and large institutional investors ultimately urging corporate leaders to move DEI issues to the front and center of their corporate policy agendas. To mark the adoption of a new unambivalent stance on this matter in July 2020 a coalition of trade organizations including the US Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers Association sent a letter to the US Senate Banking Committee in support of a bill already adopted by the US House of Representatives that would mandate proxy disclosure of self-identified race ethnicity and gender of corporate board members and executive officers. (Following the inauguration of the new US Congress in January 2021 that bill was reformulated into a new legislative proposal titled “Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act of 2021”).

Board members and senior executives should help their companies navigate these business and social changes. They should appreciate the historical importance of this moment and embrace the values that underpin it. To do so they should lead by example and address diversity imbalances in board composition and senior management. Those companies that do not yet have any diverse board members should make a clear public commitment to change. The following should become key priorities especially for boards that have not yet given a clear public indication of their commitment in this area:

Revisit director performance assessment processes to ensure they promote skill renewal and the injection of new ideas and perspectives. Directors should appreciate the importance of maintaining diversity of tenures across the board and commit to a healthy rate of refreshment.

Develop a multi-year board succession plan where the need for strategic skills and expertise is evaluated through the lens of diversity and inclusion. The long-term plan should include developing relationships with diverse junior executives who may one day become attractive director candidates for boards of other companies. Rather than an episodic exercise director succession should align with an ongoing board development program and be rigorously informed by an emphasis on diversity.

Investigate best practices on the integration of DEI metrics into senior executives’ incentive plans. Recent studies illustrate how more and more companies including large ones have started to set executive targets meant to raise minority representation in managerial positions. Many companies that are still lagging in the promotion of diversity equity and inclusion have much to learn from peer experiences. Moreover setting DEI objectives can help to develop a diverse pool of senior managers who could one day aspire to become board nominees. To support these endeavors in July 2021 The Conference Board has introduced a new screening tool to its ESG Advantage Benchmarking Platform that allows access to granular information on the use of ESG-related metrics of performance across the Russell 3000 index.

Consider adopting a Board Diversity Matrix disclosure model that complies with the guidelines recently published by the NASDAQ Listing Center. The information provided (whether in the proxy statement or the company’s corporate website) must be based on the self-identification of each member of the board of directors. For a US incorporated company any director who chooses not to disclose a gender should be included under “Did Not Disclose Gender” and any director who chooses not to identify as any race or not to identify as LGBTQ+ should be included in the “Did Not Disclose Demographic Background” category. Following the first year of adoption of the Matrix to allow readers to appreciate the progress made the guidelines establish that all companies must include in their disclosure the current year and immediately prior year diversity statistics.

Some commentators have observed that the new California law other similar new state laws and the NASDAQ listing rule have missed the opportunity to extend the notion of board diversity to executives with disabilities. In a press release following the approval of the NASDAQ rule in particular Disability:IN (a global organization driving disability inclusion and equality in business) and the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) expressed their deep disappointment with the SEC’s decision which took place despite the vigorous lobbying campaigns by a wide group of stakeholders—including New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli the Leadership Council on Civil and Human Rights the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce the US Black Chamber and Women Impacting Public Policy. Boards of directors committed to a more diverse and inclusive leadership development and board recruitment program can remedy this omission. They can learn from experiences such as the Valuable 500 a global disability network launched at the annual Davos gathering of business leaders hosted by the World Economic Forum in 2019: the organization recently announced having reached its target of 500 major companies that officially put disability inclusion on their boardroom agenda—including Microsoft Unilever Google and Coca-Cola.

The corporate boardroom which has long been a predominantly male preserve continues to make progress on gender diversity. Both in small and mid-size companies the number of female directors is showing marked increases and among new directors more than one-third are women. By now the largest companies have more boards with three four or more than four females than boards with one or two. Those smaller entities that do not yet have any female board members should make a clear public commitment to change. While a sound succession planning process is the most effective way to promote refreshment and the election of diverse candidates boards may also wish to consider other practices. These include endorsing the model proposed by the Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board (CED) where every other board seat vacated by a retiring board member is filled by a woman. In addition directors could temporarily increase the size of the board introduce (and adhere to) overboarding restrictions and adopt guidelines on expected board tenure.

The average percentage of women serving on the board of directors continues to rise in both the S&P 500 (from 20 in 2016 to 29.1 in 2021) and the Russell 3000 index (from 15 to 24.4) but the largest increase is reported by S&P MidCap 400 companies—from 15.8 percent in 2016 to 26.7 percent in 2021.

Generally there is a direct correlation between company size and gender diversity in the boardroom with the highest percentage of female directors concentrated among boards of larger companies. For example according to 2021 proxy disclosure 31.5 percent of directors at manufacturing and nonfinancial services companies in the Russell 3000 with annual revenue of $50 billion or more are women compared to only 20.4 percent of those in smaller companies with annual revenue of $100 million or less. In the financial and real estate sectors the 30.9 percent of female directors disclosed by companies with asset value of $100 billion or more compares to the 14 percent found at companies valued under $500 million.

In the Russell 3000 index 4.2 percent of companies still have no female representative on their board of directors. The number has dropped significantly from 2016 levels when it was 24.5 percent; it is also just one-third of what was recorded in 2019 alone (12 percent). By comparison in the S&P MidCap 400 only just over 1 percent of companies have no female directors and the S&P 500 celebrated in 2019 the disappearance of the all-male board. An equally remarkable finding is that while the percentage of companies with only one or two female directors is lower than it was in 2016 in the same time period the percentage of companies with three four and more than four female directors has been growing exponentially. This trend can be generally observed across indexes but is quite pronounced in the S&P 500 index. For example about one-fourth of companies had only one female director in 2016 and the percentage has dropped to a mere 2.8 percent in 2021; on the other hand in 2016 23 percent of the S&P 500 companies had three female directors and 9.7 percent had four and those shares have grown to 36.3 percent and 25.8 percent respectively in 2021. Today more than 11.7 percent of S&P 500 companies have more than four female board members or more than four times as many as those reported in 2016.

The utilities sector has the highest percentage of Russell 3000 companies with more than four female directors (12.5 percent) while the health care sector has the lowest (1.9 percent). Health care companies disclosed the highest percentage of boards with no female representation (6.7 percent) while none of the utilities companies in the Russell 3000 index reported still having all-male boards. The energy sector reported the highest percentage of companies with just one female directors (37.3 percent) and the lowest with three female directors (16.7 percent—it is 34.4 percent among utilities firms).

The company size analysis is also quite insightful as it shows that larger organizations have been the most responsive to the demand for gender diversity in the boardroom. First none of the largest manufacturing and nonfinancial services companies (with revenue of $25 billion or higher) and none of the largest financial services and real estate companies (with asset value of $100 billion and over) have all-male boards of directors. On the contrary in the smallest manufacturing and nonfinancial services companies with annual revenue under $100 million 13.5 percent continue to have no female directors and the share is even higher in financial services and real estate firms with asset values under $500 million at 25 percent. Second the analysis clearly shows that the largest companies have gone well beyond the election of one or two female directors. For example of financial services and real estate firms with asset value of $100 billion and over 31.8 percent have three female board members 38.6 percent have four and as much as 25 percent have more than four. In that subgroup of companies only 4.5 percent have only two female directors and there are no companies with only one woman serving on the board.

The analysis zeroed in on the population of newly elected directors in 2021 and found that despite the progress on diversity most new directors continue to be male. In the S&P MidCap 400 for example 38.6 percent of newly elected directors in 2021 were female compared to 61.4 percent who were male. Statistics for the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 indexes are quite similar. While these findings show that corporations are changing the gender balance of their boards what is most striking is the increase in the proportion of new female directors compared to 2016. For example in the Russell 3000 the proportion of new directors who were women has almost doubled from 22.1 percent to 37.8 percent. Nonetheless about three-quarters of companies in the Russell 3000 and the S&P MidCap 400 as well as 66.7 percent of companies in the S&P 500 elected no new female directors in 2021 while almost all of the remaining companies elected just one.

Why does it matter? Drawing on research that links diversity and firm performance investors demand that boards become more gender diverse and promote diversity in their organizations. State Street Global Advisors was among the first large asset managers to be vocal on gender diversity launching its Fearless Girl campaign on the eve of International Women’s Day in 2017. And in the last few years alone the request to elect diverse directors has rapidly been embraced by other high-profile shareholders. BlackRock for example now encourages companies to have at least two women on their boards. Although their approach is to first engage portfolio companies on the need to improve their board diversity of genders BlackRock may vote against directors (for example those serving on the nominating committee) if insufficient progress is made.

Legislative and self-regulatory initiatives aimed at advancing board diversity also continued to intensify in the last year. In August 2021 the SEC approved NASDAQ’s new listing standards on board diversity. In addition to requiring “transparent diversity statistics regarding their board of directors” the provisions expect most NASDAQ-listed companies “to have or explain why they do not have at least two diverse directors including one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+.” Yet only a few days after its approval by the SEC the new listing provision was challenged in court.

The NASDAQ listing standard was not alone in coming under challenge. California’s board diversity legislation which became the model for several other bills at the state legislature level was also met with opposition. In particular a shareholder of a publicly traded company filed suit against the Secretary of State of California alleging that the diversity statute was unconstitutional under the equal protection provisions of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. While the litigation was initially dismissed in June 2021 a higher court reversed this decision and allowed the case to go forward.

Despite these forms of resistance to change the all-male board is fast becoming obsolete and the vast majority of corporate boards recognize the value of gender diversity. Diversity is not a check-the-box compliance exercise and companies should not relent in the pursuit of some form of gender balance on their board. Those smaller entities that do not yet have any female board members must make a clear public commitment to change. While a sound board succession planning process is the most effective way to promote refreshment and the election of diverse candidates boards may also consider other practices including endorsing the model proposed by the Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board (CED) where every other board seat vacated by a retiring board member is filled by a woman. In addition directors could temporarily increase the size of the board introduce (and adhere to) overboarding restrictions and adopt guidelines on expected board tenure.

The scope of directors’ oversight responsibilities has been expanding in the last decade including in the ESG area. But an analysis of board committee structures shows that companies still opt for the delegation of new duties to existing committees rather than the creation of new standing committees. Some exceptions may be found in certain sectors—notably the energy materials and utilities sectors where more boards are forming specialized environment health & safety committees. Smaller companies which tend to have smaller boards and committees may find it more practical to keep the oversight of new ESG issues at the full board level and frequently add those issues to the board meeting agenda—just as a board committee would do for any of its own core responsibilities.

The Conference Board and ESGAUGE have conducted a historical analysis of existing board committees across the Russell 3000 the S&P 500 and the S&P MidCap 400. The review indicates that most US public companies have not (yet) responded to the steady expansion of director responsibilities observed through the last decade by substantially reorganizing their governance structure. This finding corroborates the anecdotal evidence that when new duties are added to board committee charters they tend to be delegated to existing committees or retained at the full-board level.

In all examined indexes and company size groups the only committee types that show a slow rise in numbers are the risk committee the science & technology committee and the environment health & safety committee. And yet those committees continue to be found only in a small minority of boards of directors. For example despite the growing concerns about issues of climate change risk oversight and the pressure to expand disclosure on the matter the review of board committee names as of December 31 2020 shows that only 3.2 percent of Russell 3000 companies have instituted an environment health & safety committee up from the 2.8 percent registered in 2016. (The percentages are only slightly higher in the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P 500 at 4.3 and 8.5 percent).

Some exceptions may be emerging in specific business sectors a finding that could reflect the heightened scrutiny of certain ESG-related matters to which those industries are subject. For example the energy sector has the largest share of Russell 3000 companies with environment health & safety committees of the board of directors (or 23.9 percent) though materials and utilities companies are close behind (22.2 and 19.4 percent respectively). About one out of five real estate companies have instituted an investment/pension committee (17.6 percent followed by financials at 8.6 percent). Across business sectors highly regulated utilities companies have the most committee types including the highest percentage of public policy committees (9.7 percent up from 2.9 percent in 2016).

Aside from the traditional audit compensation and nominating/governance committees the most common standing committees of the board of directors are the executive committee and the finance committee. They are seen more often among larger and more complex organizations: For example executive committees are found in 38 percent of boards of directors of Russell 3000 companies with annual revenue of $50 billion or higher (the largest size group in our size breakdown) and their presence becomes more and more sporadic across smaller company size groups—down to only 2.2 percent of boards of companies with annual revenue under $100 million (the smallest size group in our size breakdown). Similarly 36 percent of boards in the largest size group have a finance committee compared to only 2.8 percent of those in the smallest size group.

What’s ahead? As with most other governance matters there is no single answer to the question of what committees the board of directors should institute to perform its duties. This is particularly true now that issues of ESG risk oversight are increasingly being elevated to the attention of the board. The ESG Center at The Conference Board in collaboration with ESGAUGE has started to examine how committee charters are being amended to reflect the responsibility for ESG oversight. The data collection will inform a new tool in the ESG Advantage Platform that maps the delegation of new duties to board committees and the formation of new standing committees.

In general while some tasks related to ESG oversight should be kept at the full-board level (or assigned to a dedicated ESG committee) the breadth and interdisciplinary nature of ESG warrants the delegation of specific responsibilities to the audit compensation and nominating/governance committees:

The full board is better suited to address top-level issues such as the alignment between ESG and the business strategy which is critical to allocate resources to ESG risk mitigation and to ESG opportunities. Also the full board should consider overseeing and holding management accountable for setting the direction the company should follow with respect to ESG disclosure given that for the most part this type of disclosure continues to be voluntary.

Data collection processes and the controls needed to ensure that information on ESG gathered across the company is investor grade are generally tasks for the audit committee given the experience audit committee members already have with financial disclosure controls and procedures. Similarly the audit committee is the best suited to make decisions on ESG disclosure assurance when an independent assurer is involved.

As discussed above more and more companies are exploring how to set executive incentives to drive ESG and other types of extra-financial performance. The compensation committees can perform a critical role in aligning executive compensation to ESG objectives and integrating ESG into considerations of incentive design.

The increasing importance of ESG matters raises the question of whether the company board and senior leadership have the skill set and experience necessary to oversee and carry out an ESG-informed strategy. This issue is becoming relevant to board recruitment and it can be logical for the nominating/corporate governance committee to be tasked with it. As with the desire to recruit directors from more diverse backgrounds board nominating committees need to focus on a more diverse skill set for directors in order to meet future challenges such as climate change DEI cyber security and technological advances such as artificial intelligence. They should also evaluate the need for internal skill sets against the opportunity to access specialized knowledge by retaining outside advisors.

The Conference Board recently found that for the first time in many years the role of total shareholder return (TSR) as a driver of CEO succession decisions might be starting to diminish in a sign of the growing importance of ESG and extra-financial performance. Nominating/corporate governance committees which are typically responsible for CEO succession planning and leadership development can ensure that leadership development programs give enough attention to developing ESG-related skills.

Smaller companies which tend to have smaller boards and committees may find it more practical to keep the oversight of new ESG issues at the full board level and frequently add those issues to the board meeting agenda—just as a board committee would do for any of its own core responsibilities.

The trend toward CEO-board chair separation previously more pronounced among smaller businesses in the Russell 3000 is extending to the S&P MidCap 400. Amid these governance changes some companies are tapping leaders with different backgrounds including in the military or the government. Regardless of the chosen leadership model boards should safeguard their oversight authority and assure investors of their independence. In their periodic performance assessment directors should conduct a candid review of the effectiveness of the leadership structure in place. Disclosure on the rationale for the chosen board leadership model should avoid generic boilerplate language and discuss the specific circumstances that drove the decision at the company.

A review of board leadership structures across market indexes shows that more and more mid-sized companies are departing from the traditional model of CEO-chair combination. Only until recently this trend was more common among the smallest companies in the Russell 3000. However new data reveals that the rate of change to independent board leadership has been faster in the last couple of years in the S&P MidCap 400 than in the entire Russell 3000 index.

In 2016 the percentage of companies combining the roles of CEO and board chair was almost identical in both indexes: 41 percent in the Russell 3000 and 40.8 percent in the S&P MidCap 400. But the decline in prevalence of the combination model has since accelerated in the mid-market sector and according to the most recent disclosure only 33.2 percent of S&P MidCap 400 companies still combine the two roles compared to 36 percent of Russell 3000 companies.

Our findings also show that outside of the S&P 500 index today’s most common approach to board leadership is to entrust the role of the chair to an independent member of the board of directors. Some 44.5 percent of Russell 3000 companies and 46.1 percent of S&P MidCap 400 companies have an independent board chair whereas in 19.6 percent of Russell 3000 companies and 20.8 percent of S&P MidCap 400 companies the chair duties are performed by a non-independent director other than the CEO (e.g. the company founder).

These board leadership practices contrast those found in the S&P 500 index where only one third of companies (33.2 percent) have an independent board chair and almost half (47.2 percent or a very small change from the 48.7 percent recorded in 2016) continue to combine the CEO and board chair roles. According to a review of corporate disclosure by these larger entities the most commonly cited rationales for not separating the roles are the beliefs that board leadership independence can still be ensured through a lead (or presiding) independent director (an explanation found in 54.8 percent of S&P 500 cases) and that CEOs because of their industry experience and knowledge of the company’s daily operations are best suited to set the board agenda (50 percent). In fact in almost all cases where the roles are combined the company balances the authority of the CEO within the board by instituting a lead independent director. Most often the lead director performs such duties as calling and chairing executive sessions (a responsibility described in 83.8 percent of the role descriptions included in S&P 500’s lead director charters) and acting as a liaison between non-executive directors and the CEO-chair (76.1 percent).

Our analysis extended to the professional background and to the qualifications and skills of board chairs. Even when independent they have extensive strategy experience—gained either through their (current or former) service as CEOs (about 44.9 percent in the Russell 3000 35.3 percent in the S&P MidCap 400 and 55.6 percent in the S&P 500) or through other (current or former) board leadership positions (20.8 percent in the Russell 3000 26.1 percent in the S&P MidCap 400 and 17.1 percent in the S&P 500). There are also indications that some boards are increasingly seeking leadership skills developed outside of the top executive team or directorship roles. In particular one fourth of manufacturing and nonfinancial companies with annual revenue under $4.9 million have a board chair that brings experience from below the C-Suite while 22.2 percent of board chairs of manufacturing and nonfinancial companies with annual revenue between $25 million and $49.9 million spent their careers in government or the military. In the S&P MidCap 400 since 2016 the proportion of former CEOs serving as independent chairs fell from just under 40 percent to just over 30 percent making room for other types of leadership backgrounds. Cases of board chairs with non-corporate backgrounds for example in military or the government are emerging in particular among utilities (13 percent) real estate (11.7 percent) and financial companies (7.8 percent) whereas they are absent or almost absent in other business sectors.

What’s ahead? In the United States while endorsing the need for board independence proxy advisors and the institutional investment community have generally rejected a strict one-size-fits-all approach to board leadership and entrusted the board to establish the best working relationship between the CEO the chair the lead independent director and other directors.

Shareholder proposals requesting the separation of the CEO and board chair roles are common. In fact according to the review of shareholder voting at annual general meetings conducted by The Conference Board and ESGAUGE they were the second-most voted proposal type in the 2021 proxy season (with 44 voted proposals in the January 1-June 30 period) following resolutions to allow the company to act by written consent (87 proposals). However these many filings most often come from individual investors (the main proponents this year were Kenneth Steiner and John Chevedden) and typically fail due to the lack of wide support from institutional shareholders and proxy advisors. In its voting guidelines ISS in particular identifies a few factors that will increase the likelihood of a recommendation in favor of these proposals—including evidence that the board has failed to oversee and address material risks facing the company or to adequately respond to material concerns raised by shareholders. The most recently approved proposals to appoint independent board chairs were put to a vote last year at Baxter International (NYSE: BAX) and The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA). Following those votes the companies amended their corporate governance principles to accommodate the new separation policies: Lawrence Kellner now serves as independent chair at Boeing while at Baxter the new leadership model will be implemented upon the next CEO transition.

Corporations should carefully weigh their own governance needs when choosing a board leadership model as no single structure works for every business. When making this decision the organization should consider existing board-management dynamics and regard director independence as its paramount interest. Some of the large companies that have traditionally used the combination model may hesitate to abandon it unless directors experience specific circumstances where the CEO infringed their independence or silenced them. On the other hand research shows that director independence increases at CEO turnover and falls with CEO tenure and those same organizations may conclude that the CEO succession event offers the right opportunity to transition the board leadership from the duality to the separation model. In the last decade in particular the broadening scope of the board of directors’ risk oversight responsibilities has more clearly differentiated the role of board chair from the top executive function; by separating the two a company can not only reinforce its public commitment to strong corporate governance but also draw on the leadership skills and business experience of two different individuals.

Whatever the choice of board leadership companies should fully explain its rationale in their disclosure documents. This disclosure should avoid generic boilerplate language and discuss the specific circumstances that drove the board leadership decision at the company. In particular if the duality model is retained the disclosure should detail the responsibilities that the lead independent director role will perform to counterbalance the concentration of powers in the combined CEO-chair functions.

Director election practices that are well established among larger US companies—including board declassification and majority voting—continue to elude much of the broader Russell 3000 index. But the demand for director diversity is not going to subside and smaller businesses caught unprepared to execute a solid board succession plan may ultimately find themselves not only facing shareholder activism but also at a disadvantage in the competition for leadership talent.

There continues to be a significant divide between the S&P 500 and the Russell 3000 when it comes to governance practices that are critical to a sound board succession and refreshment process—including board declassification and the adoption of a majority voting system of director elections. Just as observed for board independence and the separation of CEO and board chair positions the most interesting recent developments in this area can be ascribed to mid-size companies in the S&P MidCap 400.

A governance analyst reviewing organizational documents of S&P 500 companies would have the impression that a classified board where directors do not face annual elections is a thing of the past. A closer look at the Russell 3000 does however belie that conclusion. While only one out of ten S&P 500 companies still have different classes of directors each subject to staggered-year elections the percentage rises to 40.8 in the Russell 3000—a mere 1.7 percentage point lower than in 2016. Classified boards which make it more difficult for hostile or activist shareholders to gain control of the board are also present in as much as 62.6 percent of small companies with annual revenue under $100 million and in 54 percent of those with revenue in the $100 million-999 million bracket. Most of the recent progress toward a declassified structure can be appreciated in the S&P MidCap 400 where the prevalence of staggered boards has declined by almost 10 percentage points in the last four years (or from 40.3 to 30.9 percent).

Voting standards for director elections also differ greatly depending on the size of the company. The main choice is between a plurality voting standard (where uncontested nominees who receive the most “for” votes are elected to the board until all board seats are filled even if a majority of shares are voted against those individuals) and a majority voting standard (where a director generally loses her seat if she receives more against votes than for votes). Though declining in popularity a plurality voting standard remains the norm at many smaller companies. According to the latest disclosure 51.6 percent of Russell 3000 companies still had some form of plurality voting system (whether the straightforward one or the “plurality plus” variation where a director who did not receive the support of a majority of votes cast must tender her resignation to the board and the board may accept or deny that resignation). Some form of plurality voting is also found in 85.5 percent of Russell 3000 companies with annual revenue under $100 million and in 67.8 percent of those with annual revenue in the $100 million–$999 million bracket. By way of comparison in the S&P 500 only 9.3 percent of companies continue to rely on plurality voting. Instead more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have adopted a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections.

If we now take a look at how director election practices have changed over the last four years once again the S&P MidCap 400 ranks as the most dynamic of the three examined. Since 2016 the number of companies with some type of majority voting bylaws has grown by 1.7 percentage points in the S&P 500 by only 1.2 percentage points in the Russell 3000 and by as much as 5.4 percentage points in the S&P MidCap 400.

Our data also show that restrictions to shareholder rights are not always limited to the director election process and may extend to the right to remove directors. Under most state laws shareholders representing a majority of shares entitled to vote at an election of directors may remove any director even without cause unless the company has a classified board or allows cumulative voting. However several companies with recently declassified boards still retain old charter provisions restricting shareholders’ authority to remove directors to situations where there is a “cause” of removal (e.g. unethical behavior recurring absence from meetings or other violations of corporate policies). In fact this restriction is present in almost half of Russell 3000 companies though only a quarter of S&P 500 companies and only two-fifths of S&P MidCap 400 companies. Where shareholders do have the authority to remove directors almost a third of the Russell 3000 require some form of supermajority vote to accomplish this.

What’s ahead? As discussed above board composition and director succession planning have become priorities for investors amid renewed scrutiny of the effectiveness of board oversight and rising demands for board diversity.

Companies that retain plurality voting and/or staggered board structures may be targeted by activists if it becomes apparent that their election process shuns shareholder rights or impairs board refreshment and diversity. They may consider the following developments:

Shareholder proposals on board declassification and to repeal supermajority vote requirements have been the most successful governance-related proposal types in recent proxy seasons. In the January 1-June 30 2021 period all proposals of these kinds that were brought to a vote at Russell 3000 companies (24 in total mostly targeting smaller companies) received ample shareholder support and passed. The same 100 percent success rate was recorded for resolutions on board declassification that were voted during any of the last three proxy seasons. Today many large institutional investors expect director elections to be held annually to avoid entrenchment and promote refreshment. Unless there is a specific justification for it such as the need for stability during a strategic restructuring or the immediate post-IPO phase of a newly public company the classified board structure is often red flagged as a governance shortcoming.

Similarly as pension funds and other institutional investors embark in stewardship campaigns to promote board diversity and ESG oversight they increasingly appreciate majority voting as a tool to hold directors accountable and curb inaction. After years of decline the number of shareholder resolutions calling for majority voting has risen again in the last few proxy seasons and proponents are shifting their attention to smaller public companies outside of the S&P 500. Investors filed 16 such resolutions in 2021 up from only six in 2018; of those 10 went to a vote and three passed (at Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) Axon Enterprise Inc. (NASDAQ: AXON) and Sonoco Products Company (NYSE: SON)). Ending a few years of hiatus since 2019 CalPERS has been resuming its push in this area and was the top proponent of these types of requests in 2021. To be sure most of CalPERS’ success takes place outside of annual meetings: The fund reported that in 2020 its private engagement led as many as 20 companies to agree to adopt majority voting standards. At a minimum businesses that still use plurality voting in uncontested elections should consider using their proxy statement and investor engagement efforts to explain the rationale for their choice.

“Just Vote No” campaigns for the removal of directors are becoming more frequent. These campaigns are being mounted to express dissatisfaction with the company’s performance with respect to ESG goals—whether on climate change risk mitigation DEI policies or political spending disclosure. In 2018 only 27 directors in the entire Russell 3000 failed to receive the support of a majority of votes cast; in the 2021 proxy season that number was 68. In 2018 86 directors were reelected with less than 70 percent support level; in 2021 that number more than tripled to 308. While the typical target is the small-cap company the case of the ExxonMobil board which recently made headlines for losing three directors in a proxy fight initiated by a small 0.02% shareholder is indicative of how real this risk has become including among larger companies. That shareholder won because it made a persuasive argument on the future direction of the energy industry (including by releasing a scholarly white paper on the topic) and received the backing of several major institutional investors (including Vanguard BlackRock and State Street but also large public pension funds such as CalPERS CalSTRS and the public employee retirement funds of New York State and New York City). While it remains to be seen whether the ExxonMobil case will become the playbook for future ESG-driven proxy contests underperformance on these matters would only be amplified by director election policies perceived to shield the board from shareholder demands and reduce its accountability.

The process for contested director elections may be simplified in the near future in favor of dissidents if the SEC approves its proposed rules on the use of universal proxy cards in solicitations. In April 2021 the SEC has reopened the comment period on such proposed rules which were first issued in 2016 and would require all duly nominated board candidates—both a company’s own nominees and any brought forward by dissident shareholders—to be listed equally on a single proxy voting card whether physical or electronic. In its proposing release the SEC observed that it has become “aware of concerns that some company proxy statements had ambiguities and inaccuracies in their disclosure about voting standards in director elections.” For this reason the Commission proposed additional amendments to voting standards that would be applicable to all director elections including uncontested elections: Specifically under the proposed amendments all proxy cards would also need include an against voting choice instead of a “withhold authority to vote” option where permitted by state law or to disclose the effects of a withhold In the making for several years the reform of the proxy voting process is a priority for the SEC. Even in light of the position expressed by the Commission in the proposing release on universal proxy cards companies should review their director election policies and practices and if it is found that they could hinder shareholder rights introduce the opportune changes.

20According to a recent academic review of the credentials of more than 1000 directors at large US public companies 29 percent of board members had a relevant ESG background even though such expertise is largely concentrated in the S (social) element of ESG. Twenty-one percent of directors have relevant S experience compared to only 6 percent with governance (G) experience and 6 percent with environmental (E) experience. A fifth of directors on a board is sufficient to staff a committee 6 percent is not. However it is likely that those industries where additional standing or special committees are more common—namely utilities and environment real estate and investment/pension—will have more directors with the relevant skills.

26When a board is classified directors are organized into two or three classes; each class faces election every two or three years. Under most state laws the default rule provides for all directors to be elected annually. However to make it more difficult for hostile or activist shareholders to gain control of the board organizational documents (charters initial bylaws or bylaws adopted by a majority of shareholders) can prescribe the longer staggered terms of a classified structure: in this case the activist must win more than one proxy contest at successive shareholder meetings to elect a majority of the board members and exercise control of the target.

(""Longeveron"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: LGVN) and certain of its officers. The class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and docketed under 21-cv-23303 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired: (a) Longeveron Class A common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Offering Documents (defined below) issued in connection with the Company's initial public offering conducted on or about February 12 2021 (the ""IPO"" or ""Offering""); and/or (b) Longeveron securities between February 12 2021 and August 12 2021 both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

Longeveron is a clinical stage biotechnology company that engages in developing cellular therapies for aging-related and life-threatening conditions. The Company's lead investigational product is Lomecel-B a cell-based therapy product that is derived from culture-expanded medicinal signaling cells that are sourced from the bone marrow of young healthy adult donors. Longeveron is conducting among other trials a Phase 2b trial of its Lomecel-B product for aging frailty (the ""Phase 2b Aging Frailty Trial""). The Phase 2b Aging Frailty Trial's primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the six-minute walk test at six months (or 180 days) for Lomecel-B subjects compared to placebo subjects.

On January 19 2021 Longeveron filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") in connection with the IPO which after several amendments was declared effective by the SEC on February 11 2021 (the ""Registration Statement"").

Story continues

On or about February 12 2021 pursuant to the Registration Statement Longeveron's Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (""NASDAQ"") under the ticker symbol ""LGVN.""

Also on February 12 2021 Longeveron filed a prospectus on Form 424B4 with the SEC in connection with the IPO which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement (the ""Prospectus"" and together with the Registration Statement the ""Offering Documents"").

Pursuant to the Offering Documents Longeveron conducted the IPO issuing 2.66 million shares of its Class A common stock to the public at the Offering price of $10.00 per share for approximate proceeds of $24.7 million to the Company after applicable underwriting discounts and commissions and before expenses.

The complaint alleges that the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and as a result contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally throughout the Class Period Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business operations and compliance policies. Specifically the Offering Documents and Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Lomecel-B was not as effective in treating aging frailty as Defendants had led investors to believe; (ii) accordingly Lomecel-B's clinical and commercial prospects with respect to aging frailty were overstated; and (iii) as a result the Offering Documents and Defendants' public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading and failed to state information required to be stated therein.

On August 13 2021 Longeveron issued two press releases-one announcing topline results of the Phase 2b Aging Frailty Trial and a second providing a corporate update and reporting the Company's financial results for the second quarter of 2021. Both press releases disclosed among other results that Lomecel-B had ""not achiev[ed] . . . statistical significance for the pairwise comparison to placebo"" with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint.

On this news Longeveron's stock price fell $1.51 per share or 27.91% to close at $3.90 per share on August 13 2021 representing a total decline of 61% from the Offering price.

As of the time the complaint was filed Longeveron's stock price continues to trade below the $10.00 per share Offering price damaging investors.

While Netflix says that it's working on an iOS version of the service Bloomberg tech reporter Mark Gurman says that Apple’s App Store policies will prevent Netflix from making games available from its app.

Apple bars third-party apps from functioning as a hub for games which has become a point of contention with cloud gaming services like Xbox Cloud Gaming Nvidia GeForce Now and Google Stadia. Cloud gaming services can only get around this by offering their games through a web app just like Facebook has already done.

“Apple will need to change its rules or grant Netflix an exemption”

According to Gurman’s latest Power On newsletter Netflix will tiptoe around Apple’s rules by making its games available via the App Store. This means that games won’t be downloadable or playable from the Netflix app — you’ll only be able to launch them from there. The service currently functions in this way on Android; the games are neatly packaged in a dedicated tab on the Netflix app but are downloaded individually from the Google Play Store.

While this setup is fine it isn’t ideal for an all-in-one gaming service. Users should be able to download and play games from within the service itself. That’s why Gurman predicts that Netflix will eventually bring its games to the cloud. Again this would work fine for Android but Apple’s policies make it nearly impossible for cloud gaming to thrive forcing services to settle for measly web apps. If and when Netflix decides to embrace cloud gaming it’s unclear what will happen to the service on iOS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9pbS1zdGlsbC1ob3BlbGVzc2x5LW9ic2Vzc2VkLXdpdGgtdGhpcy1uZXRmbGl4LXNwZWNpYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm still hopelessly obsessed with this one Netflix special,"I've been dreading pandemic-influenced art. It's inevitable that such a global life-altering event would seep into movies music and TV. But for me living through it has been enough. So no I don't want to see the characters from my favorite TV show reuniting on Zoom.

I've made a grand exception though. In May comedian Bo Burnham released a special for Netflix called Inside. Set in a small guesthouse Inside is an hour and a half of Burnham's signature comedic songwriting laced with some in-between scenes and framed as if he spent the entire year locked inside with a B&H catalog's worth of gear playing with lights and cameras and barely patching up his ever-worsening mental state by making the special.

Burnham gets increasingly disheveled. He sits in the dark by himself and wears ratty T-shirts and sweats. Despite my deep-seated desire to not think about the hellscape outside anymore than I have to I've watched Inside five times.

One of the best arguments for Inside as an ideal piece of pandemic art is that it doesn't outright acknowledge the pandemic. It's a feeling so deeply familiar at this point Burnham never has to utter ""COVID-19."" There are allusions for sure. At one point Burnham says ""I've learned that real-world human-to-human tactile contact will kill you."" But many of the songs have nothing to do with the pandemic such as Welcome to the Internet a wild and unsettling overview of the chaos of life online or his ode to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Burnham having a well-lit existential crisis about turning 30. Netflix

The problems that existed before the pandemic -- the contrived nature of social media (White Woman's Instagram) the maw of content production (Don't Wanna Know) the inevitability of aging (30) -- all continue to exist but they now stand backlit by the inescapable reality of our collective situation.

There are no jokes about sourdough starter or toilet paper. Because the mental load of living through a pandemic isn't really about the TP right? It's about the persistent malaise the fear either low-lying or full-blown and whatever German word means ""watching the world end but still having to pay rent."" Burnham captures this not in tired jokes about hand sanitizer but in the way he runs his hand over his face during the in-between moments or more obviously in bits such as the sendup of Twitch streaming where he plays a video game that includes the option Press A to Cry.

The sheer vibes of lying on a pillow on the floor wrapped in a blanket eyes closed while speaking into a mic -- having not much to offer but still having to perform -- are real.

When Inside hit Netflix I'd been fully vaccinated for a month. I didn't rush back into the world but rather took small steps out returning to my strolls through Target ducking into the grocery store because I forgot to buy an onion. I dared to hug a friend. As it seemed for a brief moment that we might actually come out of this whole mess I was chased by a nagging feeling that there should be some kind of worldwide debrief on everything that happened. Surely we could all have a meeting and say ""Well that was absolutely awful.""

Of course that's not feasible and the pandemic did not in fact end. But somehow Inside helped scratch that itch for me. The claustrophobia and isolation Inside represents on screen -- the quick knowing lyrics about ""being inside trying to get something out of it"" -- made me feel a little better about confronting the preceding year of living solo looking it dead in the face and acknowledging how much it sucked even if I guiltily got through it with job health friends and family all intact. No matter how much time you spend on Zoom there's no fun way to hide from sickness and death.

What Inside pulls off is all the more impressive because I know it's not real. Burnham didn't actually spend every waking minute in that guesthouse. As I've learned from watching earlier specials of his and plenty of clips on TikTok he's got a penchant for constructing moments that feel real only to be revealed as a part of a bit. If he didn't wash his hair it was on purpose. If he knocked over the camera it was on purpose.

Maybe that speaks to his capacity for empathy as an artist. Toward the end of the special Burnham performs a song called All Eyes on Me a nearly delirious number bathed in blue light in front of a nonexistent roaring crowd. His voice is digitally pitched down and he sways against a wall-size projection of himself. He talks about having quit touring the last five years because he was having panic attacks and how just as he felt he might be ready to go back out into the world -- well you know what happened. You don't need a pandemic to keep you cooped up.

Now at the other side of the summer the horrors haven't ceased. But with the help of the vaccine and a mask I know I'm a bit less inside than I was. In my head I hear the dark undertones of the otherwise bouncy artificially optimistic little song that plays over the credits of Inside: ""It'll stop any day now any day now. Any day now.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS92aWRlby1nYW1lcy8yMDIxLzExLzA2L2FyY2FuZS1uZXRmbGl4LWxlYWd1ZS1sZWdlbmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Arcane' League of Legends' Netflix showrunners discuss their characters - The Washington Post,Netflix has adapted plenty of video games into series and films from “Castlevania” to “Dota: Dragon’s Blood.” Even “Pokémon Go’s” lesser-known predecessor “Ingress” was transposed into an animated series.

And it’s obvious to us that subtitles can offer an amazing way to experience films or TV series that otherwise might have been closed off to us.

Don’t speak French Spanish or Korean? Subtitles can help with that where they’re available. And if you just want to make sure you don’t miss a word of your favorite show having dialogue onscreen is a great supplementary information source.

However how much you access subtitles depends on a few things not least your own accessibility needs (ideal for the hard of hearing not so great for the hard of seeing). It also hangs on what TV streaming services you’re watching shows and films on how comprehensive subtitles are across that platform and the languages supported for the specific title you want to watch.

Some platforms too are far better than others at offering levels of customization such as font and text size or even telling you where these settings are in the first place (cough Apple TV Plus cough).

But if you want to know the best TV streaming service for subtitles this is the guide for you.

What is closed captioning? ‘CC’ refers to closed captions which provide further audio detail beyond just the dialogue such as descriptions of specific sounds – the running of a tap a monster’s roar or the name of the song playing on a jukebox. Sometimes it’ll just read ‘eerie music’.

What is subbed or dubbed? Subbed means it has subtitles. Dubbed means there’s an audio track in a different language to the one spoken by the actors onscreen.

Subtitles on Netflix A truly global TV streaming service Reasons to buy + Broad support Reasons to avoid - Little customization

Netflix has largely great support for subtitles and foreign languages as is fitting for such a global streaming service found in over 190 countries.

The subtitles are found in the playback bar found when you pause the action or hover over the screen in a browser. The icon is a square-shaped speech bubble to the right of the list of episodes and to the left of playback speed options. It’s there while you’re watching though the UI is a little crowded.

Subtitles are a strong clear white with size varying in browser depending on the size of the screen and they’re of an ample size on a TV – though it would be nice to have some customization here in terms of height and color.

Support varies between titles but it’s largely consistent in that you’ll get 3-5 languages supported for both subtitles and audio for Netflix Originals – whether it’s a flagship live-action series like The Witcher or an anime show like The Great Pretender. As an example The Queen’s Gambit is a Netflix Original series and its supported languages for subtitles are English CC Polish French Traditional Chinese and Arabic.

Older licensed shows are the worst offenders which you’ll find with New Girl which only has English language options – as does the UK E4 drama series Misfits and many others aside. NBC show The Good Place though supports English CC Arabic Hindi French and Polish.

There can be some mismatch between audio dubs and the subtitles as written though. Netflix notably has the rights to stream most Studio Ghibli movies outside of the US but the dub and sub are often different translations which can be confusing if you’re utilizing both at the same time.

Subtitles on Apple TV Plus Great subtitle options but where are they? Reasons to buy + Lots of customization + Extensive language support Reasons to avoid - Unintuitive layout - Limited library

Apple TV Plus is a relatively new player in the TV streaming market and launching with a small line-up is certainly a benefit when it comes to ensuring consistent accessibility across the board.

There’s a host of customization options available with different options of text size and the visibility of an outline or backing box – certainly beating Netflix on this front.

Apple also has a few distinct subtitling options including closed captions (with “relevant non-dialogue information” such as sound effects and music) audio description (to describe what’s happening on screen) and SDH (Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard-of-hearing). You’ll find all three supported on flagship title The Morning Show along with a long list of around 40 languages from Arabic and Bulgarian to Ukrainian and Vietnamese.

However Apple doesn’t make it very easy to find these options. If you’re watching on a smart TV or streaming device you won’t find any mention of them in the settings. What you have to do is press ‘down’ on your remote to bring up an accessibility taskbar which isn’t exactly intuitive if you don’t know where to look.

Subtitles on Disney Plus World domination one subtitle at a time Reasons to buy + Great for blockbuster franchises Reasons to avoid - Inconsistent language support

Disney Plus is the newest of all these TV streaming services and it has pretty good support compared to some. You’ll find a small subtitle / language icon in the top right corner of the screen and it’s easy to spot given its unique placement.

Its massive blockbuster franchises were made for global releases so it makes sense that most of them come with various language options.

The Mandalorian has pretty stellar language support with a host of language support across subtitles and audio tracks including French Polish Italian Japanese Norwegian Portuguese Swedish and Finnish. You’ll get the same support for Black Panther over in the MCU.

Some titles like Beyonce’s Black is King offer extensive subtitle support but not much for audio – which makes sense considering it has a musical element.

It’s not always consistent though. For the recent Pixar flick Onward you’ll only find three options for languages (English English Audio Description or Latin American Spanish) and only two for subtitles (English CC or Latin American Spanish). But if you’re mainly after tentpole franchises you shouldn’t have a problem.

Subtitles on Hulu This US-specific service has basic but limited subtitle support Reasons to buy + Uh... Reasons to avoid - Very few languages supported

Hulu isn’t the best performer when it comes to subtitles or audio descriptions. You’ll get both in English for most titles as we found with classic sitcom Malcolm In The Middle and the animated show Bob’s Burgers but not much more than that. Hulu Original shows like The Handmaid’s Tale and the rebooted Animaniacs series also add support for Spanish subtitles but it’s by no means consistent across the Hulu library.

Hulu is a bit different from others in this list given it’s technically only available in the US and Japan. That means it doesn’t have much incentive to bring multilingual subtitles to be fair though it does mean the offering pales in comparison to others in this list.

Subtitles on Amazon Prime Video Oh you wanted subtitles? Reasons to buy + Some basic functionality Reasons to avoid - Confusing UI - Few languages supported

Amazon certainly isn’t a major player when it comes to subtitles. English language / closed captioned subtitles are the norm but you won’t get the same spread of different languages or customization options as you will on other services.

That’s true even of Amazon-produced content. Amazon Original Soulmates is only available in English French and Italian while the Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage comedy thriller I Care A Lot is stuck with English options only (though Amazon only released the movie in limited territories while Netflix handled other locations).

Amazon loses points for how the subtitle option is implemented too. We could write a whole article on Amazon Prime Video’s UI failings – and we have – but the important issue here is that the button will read ‘Subtitle On’ if it’s already on and ‘Subtitle Off’ if it isn’t. You have to press this button to switch between modes and it’s very confusing whether ‘Subtitle On’ is a command or the current setting. You have to scroll past Amazon’s X-Ray function to get to it too.

Subtitles on Mubi Great support for international films Reasons to buy + Many classic or international films with translated subtitles Reasons to avoid - Fiddly UI - Inconsistent language support

Mubi is a tricky streaming service to fit into this list. On the one hand it hosts a huge range of prestigious non-English films from Cathy Yan’s Dead Pigs (Mandarin) to Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire (French) with English subtitle options for those who don’t speak the film’s native tongue. There are a lot of classic movies you won’t find on the more mainstream streaming services too.

However the subtitle options are generally quite limited beyond that – possibly to be expected of more indie or arthouse production companies without the larger budget of Netflix and Disney.

A help page for Mubi states that “Currently the service is localized within the United Kingdom United States France Germany Italy Turkey and Brazil” – meaning you should get the option of subtitles for the dominant language spoken in those countries. The service will automatically switch language depending on where you’re streaming but you can change the language settings in your account to choose a different tongue.

Most other countries with the service are stuck with the English subtitles too. The page also states however that “we're working hard to change this by expanding the audio and subtitle options so that all users can enjoy films in their local language.”

To access subtitles you’ll need to press ‘up’ on your TV remote (which will bring up the runtime) and then press ‘up’ again to bring up an ‘Audio & Subtitle’ icon which you’ll need to press to see all the available options. It’s a bit fiddly but good to have nonetheless.

Best streaming service for subtitles? There's no clear answer

It’s hard to pick an overall winner given the capabilities vary between each streaming service and the best option for a French speaker will be different to someone wanting subtitles in Cantonese.

Netflix is the best mainstream choice especially with its volume of titles and easy-to-access access options – and its global outlook and localized mentality (ensuring individual territories get native productions instead of just English imports) certainly helps.

While Apple TV Plus might win on the amount of language options but its slim catalogue of titles – despite some truly worthy shows such as The Morning Show and Mythic Quest – means you might run out of titles you want to subtitle pretty quickly.

The reportedly heavily loss-making digital-only station launched at the height of the pandemic last summer with a roster of high-profile and expensive presenters is one of a string of strategic bets that News UK has made as the once-formidable commercial power of assets like the Sun wanes.

From paywalls to Piers Morgan Murdoch has committed hundreds of millions of pounds trying to equip News UK which includes the Times and the Sunday Times to compete in the era of the Silicon Valley giants. But a chequered history of investments has dogged efforts to break with its traditional print roots and create a digitally led powerhouse.

“For much of the last decade News UK had a reputation [within News Corporation] for this wild acquisition strategy” says one former executive. “It was like an opportunistic bankers’ list of targets – not strategic – if it was tech and digital it got an overly enthusiastic reception.”

The 2015 acquisition of the London-based digital ad tech company Unruly in a deal potentially worth as much as £114m announced 10 days after Rebekah Brooks returned as chief executive of Murdoch’s British newspaper business marked the biggest UK acquisition since the phone-hacking scandal.

A little over four years later it was offloaded to the London-listed video ad business Tremor International for £1 with News UK recording an overall loss of £33.6m loss on the business.

“It wasn’t a good fit” says one source. “We didn’t really understand what they did I don’t think. The teams got on well the cultural fit was OK but no one quite got how to get the best out of it.”

While ultimately the big strategic decisions at the UK operation are made by News Corporation’s chief executive Robert Thomson a fellow Australian and long-serving Murdoch lieutenant Brook’s close relationship with the nonagenarian means she also has significant autonomy.

The tension in the power dynamic was highlighted following the rollout of Times Radio when Thomson was reportedly critical of the venture and said it should be shut.

“It’s News Corp there is no open warfare but behind the scenes it’s like Game of Thrones” says one source. “Rebekah is like this proxy sibling. Officially Thomson of course has control everything has to go through New York on a factual level they are his deals. On a practical level they are her acquisitions.”

While owning Unruly didn’t work out News Corp may at least get some of its money back. As part of the sale the publisher received a 7% stake in Tremor. Since then the digital ad boom has led Tremor’s share price to more than triple cracking £1bn in market value with News Corp’s stake surging to £74m.

There has been no such lucky exit on Storyful the Irish-founded “social news agency” turned corporate brand management business which was acquired for €18m in 2013. The company which is still owned by News Corp remains in the red having run up losses of well over €40m since it was acquired.

“In the end the total mindset was driven by wanting the business to be more digital to be able to say at every results meeting the proportion of revenues that were digital had increased” says another former executive. “If you pitched any idea that didn’t advance that it was dead in the water.”

One target became something of an obsession among the UK top brass but unlike its parent company it would never come to fruition: property.

“A lot of time was spent looking – an obsessive amount – on the [property] aggregator/portal market” said a former executive. “Rightmove was too expensive but Zoopla specifically its uSwitch subsidiary was a very tricky but constant conversation at one point.”

At the end of the noughties Eric Schmidt then Google’s chief executive warned Murdoch that his plan to take the Times and Sunday Times down the paywall route that had worked for stablemate the Wall Street Journal was a doomed model for a more general news product.

Newspaper sales tumbled from 508000 copies a day at the launch of the paywall in 2010 to 365000 last March when News UK stopped having circulation figures for its titles publicly audited. There has been digital growth: the titles hit a digital subscriber base of 380000 by the end of September this year. They went from a £70m loss in 2009 to profitability by 2014.

But it appears to be losing the subscriber race with The Telegraph which said recently that it had passed the 500000 mark having transitioned to a subscriber-focused model only in 2018. The jury is out on whether Times Radio said to be losing millions of pounds a year will deliver a big hike in digital subscriptions.

“At the time there were so many threats to the overall business and many thought there wouldn’t be a print title within five years” says one former executive. “It’s played out as well as anyone could have hoped at the time. That business is now more profitable than it has been in living memory.”

The same cannot be said of its stablemate the Sun which has become Murdoch’s biggest casualty of the digital era. A paywall was erected in 2013 backed by a £30m splurge on exclusive Premier League internet and mobile rights to pull in paying punters only to be dismantled within two years.

“The pitch was to do the same for the Sun” said a former executive “until Rupert lost his nerve and abandoned it. He got spooked by Mail Online and the stories about its reach and revenues. He wanted to chase those numbers.”

The Sun has been in freefall ever since with revenues halving between 2011 and 2021. Profits of £80m to £100m annually a decade ago have turned into operating losses north of £60m. The Sun’s global monthly unique user base was 133m in September down seven million on the same month last year. Mail Online claims more than a third more at over 183m as of July.

In June it emerged that Murdoch had written down the value of the Sun newspapers to zero. And last year in a piece of Fleet Street symbolism the Sun lost its title of UK’s bestselling newspaper to the Daily Mail; it had been the nation’s most popular paper since 1978.

Strategic attempts to boost the business have largely failed. The most high-profile of these was the collapse of its gambling venture Sun Bets three years ago with its joint venture partner Tabcorp saying the tie-up performed below expectations and paying £39.5m to end the relationship.

“The Sun is a challenged business and the company doesn’t yet have its arms around what to do with it strategically” says Douglas McCabe chief executive at Enders Analysis. “The brand’s confidence has been hit for sure but it remains relevant and there are always opportunities: what might it merge with or acquire? The Sun can be a huge network play.”

Broadcast is its latest attempt to turn the tide. The biggest UK acquisition in recent years was NewsCorp’s £220m deal in 2016 to buy Wireless Group owner of radio stations including Virgin Radio TalkRADIO and TalkSport which owned valuable audio rights including Premier League football. Star signings include Chris Evans Jeremy Kyle and Trisha Goddard.

Building on the expansion of Wireless Murdoch’s next big bet is TalkTV a linear TV station and streaming service that aims to challenge the ailing rightwing channel GB News with Piers Morgan its first star signing.

Andrew Neil scarred from his acrimonious departure from GB News recently suggested that Morgan might want to rethink his decision and “drive in the opposite direction”.

While News UK’s video ambitions will be much lower-cost than a full 24-hour channel there will still be significant investment required not least to secure slots on platforms including Freeview Virgin Media and Sky. It could turn out to be News UK’s costliest foray yet.

“News UK is building an overall scale platform; ‘We aren’t just newspapers we are a conglomerate’. You need to innovate to fly and you can’t criticise them for experimenting and looking at different models” says McCabe. “News Corporation has always had a swagger an extraordinary confidence but in recent times I’m not sure News UK has quite had it. This is about getting that swagger back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR2aWRzaHViLm5ldC9uZXdzLzM5ODc0OC9idWlsZGluZy1jb3Jwc21lbi1jdWx0dXJlLXNob3J0LWhpc3RvcnktaG9zcGl0YWwtY29ycHMtc2Nob29s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building Corpsmen Culture: A Short History of the Hospital Corps “A” School,"Photo By André B.

A Hospital Corpsman does not become a Corpsman without extensive training. And training remains a constant for every Corpsman’s career. This was certainly well known when the Hospital Corps was being planned in the 1890s and is the very reason for the Name “Hospital Corpsman.” The naval hospital was the chief platform from where sailors would learn to become Corpsmen.



Over the history of the Hospital Corps the Navy has continued to develop and ensure that Corpsmen always have the requisite skills for practicing their trade aboard ship and ashore. These efforts include the establishment of the first Basic School in 1902 the development of the first “C” Schools in the 1910s the formation of the first advanced or IDC school in World War I the advent of field medical training in World War II and Korea to the trauma training initiative and the dynamic training collaborations that we continue to build on today.



For nearly as long as there has been a Hospital Corps the Basic or “A” School has served as the cornerstone for training and charged with imparting the fundamental values traditions and requisite tools to prospective Corpsmen.



On June 18 1914 the Navy established the Hospital Corps School at the Naval Training Station in Newport R.I. Although not the Navy’s first foray into training Corpsmen this school represented the start of an unbroken commitment to training Corpsmen which continues to this day at the Joint Base-San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston.



Just over a decade before the Newport School was founded the Navy spearheaded the concept of a Hospital Corps training on the campus of Naval Hospital Norfolk (Portsmouth) in Virginia. Course work for what was called the “Naval Hospital Corps Training School” was comprised of three months of instruction in nursing elementary anatomy physiology elementary hygiene materia medica and pharmacy bandaging and splints first aid and discipline and drill. Upon course completion each graduate was assigned to a naval hospital for a period of practical instruction before detailed to a ship or station. On December 15 1902 the Navy bestowed certificates to the first ever graduating class of a Corps School. Owing to the alphabetical order in which certificates were awarded Hospital Apprentice Max Armstrong of Oskaloosa Iowa earned the distinction as the first Corps School graduate in history.



The impact of specially trained corpsmen was a gradual but significant innovation. Within two years of the Norfolk School’s founding Corps School graduates represented 25 percent of the entire Hospital Corps. By October 1909 graduates made up over 50 percent of the active Hospital Corps.



Corps School’s First Relocation:



Long before the Hospital Corps School Great Lakes relocated to San Antonio in 2011 there had already been some precedence for relocating Corps Schools. The Hospital Corps School San Francisco (Yerba Buena) moved to Naval Hospital Mare Island and then to San Diego in the 1920s. And the Navy’s original Basic School relocated to Washington D.C. in 1907 while the Naval Hospital Norfolk was in the midst of a massive “modernization” project.



The Corps School’s new home was the recently vacated Naval Hospital building on 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE in Washington D.C. The new school house was located just blocks away from the Washington Navy Yard and the Marine Barracks and just over four miles from the home of the Naval Hospital and Naval Medical School. The move was not without some controversy. The hospital building offered limited room for growth and some in Navy Medicine thought the Nation’s Capital was a “less than ideal” location due to “corrupting influences.”



Rear Adm. Presley Rixey Surgeon General of the Navy remarked that: “While class rooms and living quarters for the men are in themselves healthy and fairly well adapted to the requirements the lack of grounds about the building for exercise and drill is a serious drawback. Moreover the close proximity of the streets and dwellings nearby afford opportunities for mischief which young men naturally do not overlook thus often inadvertently involve themselves in trouble and bring the uniform into disrepute.”



The Disestablishment of Corps School:



Throughout the history of Hospital Corps School there has always been a desire to enhance learning opportunities for Corpsmen and adapt the curriculum to the current and future needs of the Navy. In recent years this can be seen with the implementation of mandatory Personnel Qualification Standards (PWS) and the development of the trauma training initiative. Back in 1908 leadership sought to supplement the classroom experience by sending students from Class No. 14 to the newly renovated USS Relief as it circumnavigated the globe with the “Great White Fleet.”



The Relief’s Commanding Officer Dr. Charles Francis Stokes had long been a proponent of practical instruction of Corpsmen and believed that training recruits at sea “obviates the need for [a] training school.” Two years later as the new Surgeon General Stokes took immediate action to change the way corpsmen were trained. On February 11 1911 upon the graduation of Class No. 20 the Hospital Corps School Washington D.C. was disestablished leaving the Navy without a school to train corpsmen. Under the Navy’s program all hospital apprentices first class and hospital apprentices received practical and “on the job” training aboard ships and at hospitals in medical and surgical nursing; materia medica and practical pharmacy; emergency surgery and first aid; application of splints and occlusive dressings; bandaging; anatomy and physiology; transportation methods; aseptic operation drill; sterilization; preparation of patient for operation; hygiene personal and shipboard; venereal prophylaxis; medical records; as well as care of instruments and medical stores.



In his report to the Secretary of the Navy Rear Adm. Stokes wrote that “the plan has demonstrated its value. It is of particular benefit to hospitals where the majority of patients need the care of experienced men.”



To supplement this practical training the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) also began preparing an educational manual for corpsmen that would be known as the Handy-Book of the Hospital Corps (and later The Hospital Corps Handbook).



“A” School in Newport:



In Spring 1914 as the typewritten pages of The Handy-book of the Hospital Corps were being prepared for printing Rear Adm. William C. Braisted was settling into his post as the newly appointed Surgeon General of the Navy. The new “SG” had served as an aide to Presley Rixey one of the forces behind the original Hospital Corps School in Norfolk and held that prospective corpsmen needed the structure of a school in addition to the “hands on” training. He tasked Surgeon Frank W. McCullough USN to locate a new home for the proposed Hospital Corps School at the Navy Training Station in Newport R.I. (then the largest and oldest in the Navy).



As to the location of the new school house McCullough chose the vacated Naval Hospital Newport building on Coasters Harbor Island adjacent to the Training Station. The old hospital building was an imposing and attractive wooden structure measuring 60 feet long and 33 feet wide. Its three-story central building was flanked by two single story wings that originally served as the hospital’s wards. At its peak it could house as many as 102 patients; following its transformation to a schoolhouse it would accommodate as many as 100 students. The former wards were to be used as classrooms and laboratories.



The corridors contained specimens of crude drugs and exhibits. Closets and quarters now held stretchers and litters sterilizing outfits supply tables. Large ward equipped with small lecture platform and 100 desks and seats arranged in rows and aisles. All lectures except those relating to lab subjects are given here.



The new Corps School provided a six month training course embracing everything in the Handy-Book of the Hospital Corps. And upon graduation all newly minted corpsmen were sent to naval hospitals where they would receive additional practical nursing training for six months before being sent to sea.



Postscript:



A year after Newport was established the Navy formed a second Hospital Corps School in Yerba Buena (San Francisco) Calif. Newport and Yerba Buena continued to serve as the first stop for all prospective Corpsmen into the 1920s.



During World War I additional Basic Schools were established at Great Lakes Ill. Norfolk Virginia and temporary schools were stood up at the College of Pharmacy at Columbia University University of Minnesota and the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. In 1921 the Navy closed Hospital Corps Schools Newport and Great Lakes. The latter school was later reopened in 1942.



In the history of Hospital Corps training nothing quite compares to World War II though. During the war years the Navy operated Basic Corps Schools in Bainbridge and Bethesda Maryland Brooklyn N.Y. Farragut Idaho Great Lakes Ill. Portsmouth Virginia Sampson N.Y. and San Diego Calif. Collectively these schools prepared some 120000 Corpsmen for the war effort -- a feat that will surely remain unsurpassed.

Pauline Hanson is reportedly launching a cartoon series titled Please Explain and it will be similar to South Park.

The Australian reports the One Nation leader will be looking to target young voters (18 to 35-year-olds) with her 20-episode series.

Each episode will last around two minutes and they will be rolled out across social media giants like Facebook TikTok Instagram and Twitter to maximise their chance of being seen by young Aussies.

Advert

News Corp explains how the setting of the series will be in a classroom and Hanson will be the teacher.

She will be using her own voice in the show and the 'unruly' students will be a collection of big name politicians and political figures in Australia.

Pauline Hanson's Please Explain

We'll get to see Scott Morrison dressed in his Hawaiian holiday attire and even see the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce dressed as a beetroot.

Advert

The series will also feature Anthony Albanese Barnaby Joyce Adam Bandt Sarah Hanson-Young Peter Dutton (who has been dressed up as Lord Voldemort) Bob Katter and Craig Kelly.



Former Prime Ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Kevin Rudd will make an appearance in the classroom as 'miserable ghosts' who keep trying to disrupt the lesson.



The Australian believes the first three episodes could drop as early as this week so keep your eyes peeled on social media if you want to see a politician spend their time slagging off other MPs and officials in the form of a cartoon series.

It's reported the series cost upwards of six figures which sounds like a great investment.

Advert

It's unclear how Hanson will be utilising these episodes to attract young Australians to vote for One Nation however it's believed to be essentially an election campaign video that is animated.

Maybe the One Nation camp believes 18 to 35 year old Aussies will be won over by animated politicians being told off by an omnipotent educator in the form of Pauline Hanson.

We'll soon see what the episodes are like and whether they achieve their goal.

“At the time there were so many threats to the overall business and many thought there wouldn’t be a print title within five years” says one former executive. “It’s played out as well as anyone could have hoped at the time. That business is now more profitable than it has been in living memory.”

The same cannot be said of its stablemate the Sun which has become Murdoch’s biggest casualty of the digital era. A paywall was erected in 2013 backed by a £30m splurge on exclusive Premier League internet and mobile rights to pull in paying punters only to be dismantled within two years.

“The pitch was to do the same for the Sun” said a former executive “until Rupert lost his nerve and abandoned it. He got spooked by Mail Online and the stories about its reach and revenues. He wanted to chase those numbers.”

The Sun has been in freefall ever since with revenues halving between 2011 and 2021. Profits of £80m to £100m annually a decade ago have turned into operating losses north of £60m. The Sun’s global monthly unique user base was 133m in September down seven million on the same month last year. Mail Online claims more than a third more at over 183m as of July.

In June it emerged that Murdoch had written down the value of the Sun newspapers to zero. And last year in a piece of Fleet Street symbolism the Sun lost its title of UK’s bestselling newspaper to the Daily Mail; it had been the nation’s most popular paper since 1978.

Strategic attempts to boost the business have largely failed. The most high-profile of these was the collapse of its gambling venture Sun Bets three years ago with its joint venture partner Tabcorp saying the tie-up performed below expectations and paying £39.5m to end the relationship.

“The Sun is a challenged business and the company doesn’t yet have its arms around what to do with it strategically” says Douglas McCabe chief executive at Enders Analysis. “The brand’s confidence has been hit for sure but it remains relevant and there are always opportunities: what might it merge with or acquire? The Sun can be a huge network play.”

Broadcast is its latest attempt to turn the tide. The biggest UK acquisition in recent years was NewsCorp’s £220m deal in 2016 to buy Wireless Group owner of radio stations including Virgin Radio TalkRADIO and TalkSport which owned valuable audio rights including Premier League football. Star signings include Chris Evans Jeremy Kyle and Trisha Goddard.

Building on the expansion of Wireless Murdoch’s next big bet is TalkTV a linear TV station and streaming service that aims to challenge the ailing rightwing channel GB News with Piers Morgan its first star signing.

Andrew Neil scarred from his acrimonious departure from GB News recently suggested that Morgan might want to rethink his decision and “drive in the opposite direction”.

While News UK’s video ambitions will be much lower-cost than a full 24-hour channel there will still be significant investment required not least to secure slots on platforms including Freeview Virgin Media and Sky. It could turn out to be News UK’s costliest foray yet.

“News UK is building an overall scale platform; ‘We aren’t just newspapers we are a conglomerate’. You need to innovate to fly and you can’t criticise them for experimenting and looking at different models” says McCabe. “News Corporation has always had a swagger an extraordinary confidence but in recent times I’m not sure News UK has quite had it. This is about getting that swagger back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR2aWRzaHViLm5ldC9uZXdzLzM5ODc0OC9idWlsZGluZy1jb3Jwc21lbi1jdWx0dXJlLXNob3J0LWhpc3RvcnktaG9zcGl0YWwtY29ycHMtc2Nob29s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building Corpsmen Culture: A Short History of the Hospital Corps “A” School,"Photo By André B.

A Hospital Corpsman does not become a Corpsman without extensive training. And training remains a constant for every Corpsman’s career. This was certainly well known when the Hospital Corps was being planned in the 1890s and is the very reason for the Name “Hospital Corpsman.” The naval hospital was the chief platform from where sailors would learn to become Corpsmen.



Over the history of the Hospital Corps the Navy has continued to develop and ensure that Corpsmen always have the requisite skills for practicing their trade aboard ship and ashore. These efforts include the establishment of the first Basic School in 1902 the development of the first “C” Schools in the 1910s the formation of the first advanced or IDC school in World War I the advent of field medical training in World War II and Korea to the trauma training initiative and the dynamic training collaborations that we continue to build on today.



For nearly as long as there has been a Hospital Corps the Basic or “A” School has served as the cornerstone for training and charged with imparting the fundamental values traditions and requisite tools to prospective Corpsmen.



On June 18 1914 the Navy established the Hospital Corps School at the Naval Training Station in Newport R.I. Although not the Navy’s first foray into training Corpsmen this school represented the start of an unbroken commitment to training Corpsmen which continues to this day at the Joint Base-San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston.



Just over a decade before the Newport School was founded the Navy spearheaded the concept of a Hospital Corps training on the campus of Naval Hospital Norfolk (Portsmouth) in Virginia. Course work for what was called the “Naval Hospital Corps Training School” was comprised of three months of instruction in nursing elementary anatomy physiology elementary hygiene materia medica and pharmacy bandaging and splints first aid and discipline and drill. Upon course completion each graduate was assigned to a naval hospital for a period of practical instruction before detailed to a ship or station. On December 15 1902 the Navy bestowed certificates to the first ever graduating class of a Corps School. Owing to the alphabetical order in which certificates were awarded Hospital Apprentice Max Armstrong of Oskaloosa Iowa earned the distinction as the first Corps School graduate in history.



The impact of specially trained corpsmen was a gradual but significant innovation. Within two years of the Norfolk School’s founding Corps School graduates represented 25 percent of the entire Hospital Corps. By October 1909 graduates made up over 50 percent of the active Hospital Corps.



Corps School’s First Relocation:



Long before the Hospital Corps School Great Lakes relocated to San Antonio in 2011 there had already been some precedence for relocating Corps Schools. The Hospital Corps School San Francisco (Yerba Buena) moved to Naval Hospital Mare Island and then to San Diego in the 1920s. And the Navy’s original Basic School relocated to Washington D.C. in 1907 while the Naval Hospital Norfolk was in the midst of a massive “modernization” project.



The Corps School’s new home was the recently vacated Naval Hospital building on 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE in Washington D.C. The new school house was located just blocks away from the Washington Navy Yard and the Marine Barracks and just over four miles from the home of the Naval Hospital and Naval Medical School. The move was not without some controversy. The hospital building offered limited room for growth and some in Navy Medicine thought the Nation’s Capital was a “less than ideal” location due to “corrupting influences.”



Rear Adm. Presley Rixey Surgeon General of the Navy remarked that: “While class rooms and living quarters for the men are in themselves healthy and fairly well adapted to the requirements the lack of grounds about the building for exercise and drill is a serious drawback. Moreover the close proximity of the streets and dwellings nearby afford opportunities for mischief which young men naturally do not overlook thus often inadvertently involve themselves in trouble and bring the uniform into disrepute.”



The Disestablishment of Corps School:



Throughout the history of Hospital Corps School there has always been a desire to enhance learning opportunities for Corpsmen and adapt the curriculum to the current and future needs of the Navy. In recent years this can be seen with the implementation of mandatory Personnel Qualification Standards (PWS) and the development of the trauma training initiative. Back in 1908 leadership sought to supplement the classroom experience by sending students from Class No. 14 to the newly renovated USS Relief as it circumnavigated the globe with the “Great White Fleet.”



The Relief’s Commanding Officer Dr. Charles Francis Stokes had long been a proponent of practical instruction of Corpsmen and believed that training recruits at sea “obviates the need for [a] training school.” Two years later as the new Surgeon General Stokes took immediate action to change the way corpsmen were trained. On February 11 1911 upon the graduation of Class No. 20 the Hospital Corps School Washington D.C. was disestablished leaving the Navy without a school to train corpsmen. Under the Navy’s program all hospital apprentices first class and hospital apprentices received practical and “on the job” training aboard ships and at hospitals in medical and surgical nursing; materia medica and practical pharmacy; emergency surgery and first aid; application of splints and occlusive dressings; bandaging; anatomy and physiology; transportation methods; aseptic operation drill; sterilization; preparation of patient for operation; hygiene personal and shipboard; venereal prophylaxis; medical records; as well as care of instruments and medical stores.



In his report to the Secretary of the Navy Rear Adm. Stokes wrote that “the plan has demonstrated its value. It is of particular benefit to hospitals where the majority of patients need the care of experienced men.”



To supplement this practical training the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) also began preparing an educational manual for corpsmen that would be known as the Handy-Book of the Hospital Corps (and later The Hospital Corps Handbook).



“A” School in Newport:



In Spring 1914 as the typewritten pages of The Handy-book of the Hospital Corps were being prepared for printing Rear Adm. William C. Braisted was settling into his post as the newly appointed Surgeon General of the Navy. The new “SG” had served as an aide to Presley Rixey one of the forces behind the original Hospital Corps School in Norfolk and held that prospective corpsmen needed the structure of a school in addition to the “hands on” training. He tasked Surgeon Frank W. McCullough USN to locate a new home for the proposed Hospital Corps School at the Navy Training Station in Newport R.I. (then the largest and oldest in the Navy).



As to the location of the new school house McCullough chose the vacated Naval Hospital Newport building on Coasters Harbor Island adjacent to the Training Station. The old hospital building was an imposing and attractive wooden structure measuring 60 feet long and 33 feet wide. Its three-story central building was flanked by two single story wings that originally served as the hospital’s wards. At its peak it could house as many as 102 patients; following its transformation to a schoolhouse it would accommodate as many as 100 students. The former wards were to be used as classrooms and laboratories.



The corridors contained specimens of crude drugs and exhibits. Closets and quarters now held stretchers and litters sterilizing outfits supply tables. Large ward equipped with small lecture platform and 100 desks and seats arranged in rows and aisles. All lectures except those relating to lab subjects are given here.



The new Corps School provided a six month training course embracing everything in the Handy-Book of the Hospital Corps. And upon graduation all newly minted corpsmen were sent to naval hospitals where they would receive additional practical nursing training for six months before being sent to sea.



Postscript:



A year after Newport was established the Navy formed a second Hospital Corps School in Yerba Buena (San Francisco) Calif. Newport and Yerba Buena continued to serve as the first stop for all prospective Corpsmen into the 1920s.



During World War I additional Basic Schools were established at Great Lakes Ill. Norfolk Virginia and temporary schools were stood up at the College of Pharmacy at Columbia University University of Minnesota and the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. In 1921 the Navy closed Hospital Corps Schools Newport and Great Lakes. The latter school was later reopened in 1942.



In the history of Hospital Corps training nothing quite compares to World War II though. During the war years the Navy operated Basic Corps Schools in Bainbridge and Bethesda Maryland Brooklyn N.Y. Farragut Idaho Great Lakes Ill. Portsmouth Virginia Sampson N.Y. and San Diego Calif. Collectively these schools prepared some 120000 Corpsmen for the war effort -- a feat that will surely remain unsurpassed.

The crowd at the gate didn’t know it but the Marines had been told to close it at 6 p.m.

That left just 30 minutes for Capt. Geoff Ball 33 commander of 2nd Battalion 1st Marines’ Ghost Company to pluck out a few more people with that elusive combination of affiliation and luck that would get them onto a plane out of Afghanistan. Just 30 more minutes for Cpl. Hunter Lopez 22 to grab another child out of the sewage canal where hundreds jostled. Just 30 minutes for Capt. Andres Rodriguez 31 to scan the crowd for men who fit the descriptions in dozens of text messages from people in the United States trying to save their interpreters.

The plan for the final “retrograde” of the American war in Afghanistan was clear: On Aug. 26 the British troops stationed at the nearby Baron Hotel would fall back. A few hours later the 82nd Airborne would take up the Marines’ forward positions allowing Ghost Company to fold into the terminal. And finally the 82nd Airborne would fall back to the airport to waiting planes ending America’s longest war.

Pauline Hanson is reportedly launching a cartoon series titled Please Explain and it will be similar to South Park.

The Australian reports the One Nation leader will be looking to target young voters (18 to 35-year-olds) with her 20-episode series.

Each episode will last around two minutes and they will be rolled out across social media giants like Facebook TikTok Instagram and Twitter to maximise their chance of being seen by young Aussies.

Advert

News Corp explains how the setting of the series will be in a classroom and Hanson will be the teacher.

She will be using her own voice in the show and the 'unruly' students will be a collection of big name politicians and political figures in Australia.

Pauline Hanson's Please Explain

We'll get to see Scott Morrison dressed in his Hawaiian holiday attire and even see the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce dressed as a beetroot.

Advert

The series will also feature Anthony Albanese Barnaby Joyce Adam Bandt Sarah Hanson-Young Peter Dutton (who has been dressed up as Lord Voldemort) Bob Katter and Craig Kelly.



Former Prime Ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Kevin Rudd will make an appearance in the classroom as 'miserable ghosts' who keep trying to disrupt the lesson.



The Australian believes the first three episodes could drop as early as this week so keep your eyes peeled on social media if you want to see a politician spend their time slagging off other MPs and officials in the form of a cartoon series.

It's reported the series cost upwards of six figures which sounds like a great investment.

Advert

It's unclear how Hanson will be utilising these episodes to attract young Australians to vote for One Nation however it's believed to be essentially an election campaign video that is animated.

Maybe the One Nation camp believes 18 to 35 year old Aussies will be won over by animated politicians being told off by an omnipotent educator in the form of Pauline Hanson.

We'll soon see what the episodes are like and whether they achieve their goal.

Digital fashion is essentially the same thing as traditional fashion but the jeans and shirts you buy aren’t physical garments and you won’t wear them — your avatar will.

“Digital fashion” has been around for a while — games like Fortnite offer outfits (also known as “skins”) for avatars to wear — but as the metaverse is gaining popularity more brands are looking to monetize their goods by creating digital versions for consumers to buy.

In the news: Nike is among the big brands ready to monetize the metaverse.

“Virtual worlds are a new frontier.” Josh Gerben

In late October the company filed trademark applications that if approved would give it the exclusive right to use its iconic logos and slogans on digital goods in virtual worlds and environments.

“Virtual worlds are a new frontier” Josh Gerben the trademark attorney who spotted the filings told the Wall Street Journal. “It will probably become a revenue stream for Nike.”

What’s the metaverse? The metaverse is expected to be the next evolution of the internet.

Though we don’t know exactly what it’ll look like the core idea is that we’ll use VR headsets and digital avatars to move around virtual worlds the same way we use browsers to move between websites today.

Everything we do online today we’ll do in the metaverse tomorrow in a more immersive way. Instead of using video-chat software like Zoom for work meetings for example we may don VR headsets and chat with the digital avatars of our coworkers in virtual conference rooms.

The metaverse will also give us a new way to do “real world” activities online. Rather than getting all sweaty at the real Coachella we could meet the avatars of our friends at virtual festival stages to catch sets by performers’ own digital likenesses.

Everything we do online today we’ll do in the metaverse tomorrow.

That means the metaverse is also likely to change how we shop.

Instead of going to the mall or visiting a brand’s website to look at 2D-versions of clothes today our avatars may walk around virtual stores getting 3D views of clothing and even trying on garments before we decide whether or not to have them shipped to our homes.

The metaverse will also open up a whole new realm of things for us to shop for: digital goods. These are the products that we’ll want to use in the metaverse — it’s the clothes and makeup our avatars will wear and the furniture and art we’ll use to decorate our digital spaces.

Digital goods: Now that the metaverse is looking more and more like an inevitability (and less like one of many possibilities) major brands such as Nike Coca-Cola and Gucci are taking notice and looking for ways to translate their physical products into digital goods — and rake in those very real profits.

If the trademark office approves Nike’s applications it will have the exclusive right to use its iconic swoosh logo “Just Do It” slogan and other designs on digital goods.

The metaverse will open up a whole new realm of things for us to shop for: digital goods.

Though the company hasn’t revealed any specific products it plans to sell in the metaverse the application covers “footwear clothing headwear eyewear bags sports bags backpacks sports equipment art toys and accessories.”

If the applications are approved Nike will also have the ability to take legal action against anyone selling digital knock-offs in the metaverse.

“If you want to police your trademarks in that world it’s going to be easier if you just own registrations for virtual goods” Gerben told CNBC.

Legit products: As for how anyone will be able to tell that a digital avatar is wearing a pair of Air Jordans made by Nike and not an identical-looking pair sold illegally the company could include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with purchases.

These are files stored on a public blockchain that act as a proof of ownership for digital products. They’ve become popular in the art world but sports equipment brand Asics recently showed how they could be used by retailers to sell digital goods destined for the metaverse.

In July it auctioned off a collection of nine digital sneakers authenticated by NFTs. It sold just 20 copies of each sneaker in the collection and purchasers received 3D models of the shoes as part of the sale.

“These files can be used for rendering and animation to create new works of art or to outfit avatars in the Metaverse” the company wrote on its website. “Our hope is that these assets are used creatively to push the boundaries of footwear.”

The bottom line: It’s looking like there will be a lot of money to be made in the metaverse — the Information expects it to be worth $82 billion by 2025 — so brands would be foolish to not explore its monetization potential.

“Today every company needs a website and/or an online business strategy” Pat Bocchicchio an analyst for venture capital firm Loup Ventures wrote in 2018. “Tomorrow companies will have entire teams dedicated to thinking about ways to advertise sell or even build a product within the metaverse.”

Perhaps more surprisingly it attracted enough support from Republicans to pass the Senate in August. Though as of this writing Democrats in the House are divided over how and whether to tie the bill to other agendas it seems likely that Biden will eventually realize his ambition to tilt far more transportation dollars toward rail.

It’s a worthy goal. The bill promises to furnish a more convenient and environmentally friendly mode of travel between destinations that are far enough apart to make driving tedious but close enough together to make flying impossible or at best impractical. You might never use these new trains yourself but those who do will benefit you by creating less traffic congestion cleaner air and a cooler planet. Removing more freight from pavement-pounding long-haul semitrucks onto super-fuel-efficient trains will make driving safer and more pleasant and would yield huge reductions in carbon emissions.

But for any of this to happen on any meaningful scale the Biden administration will need to do more than just invest more public money in train travel. It will also need to reverse decades of deregulation lax antitrust enforcement and other policy blunders that have left modern-day robber barons in control of nearly all the nation’s highly monopolized railroad infrastructure just as they were in the worst days of the Gilded Age. Only this time the financiers aren’t presiding over an expanding rail system; they’re selling it off and permanently liquidating its assets for short-term economic gain.

Unless Biden takes on the financiers even maintaining Amtrak service let alone expanding it will become ridiculously expensive. Here’s an example that shows why.

Amtrak for decades offered train service along the Gulf Coast corridor between New Orleans and Mobile Alabama. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina badly damaged the tracks. The two giant corporate rail systems that own the line Norfolk Southern and CSX made the necessary repairs and within a year resumed running their own freight trains. But Amtrak service has never returned.

It is not that people in the region don’t want their Amtrak trains back. A broad coalition of civic and business leaders including Mississippi Republican Senator Roger Wicker has been trying for years to persuade the railroads to let Amtrak resume operating. They point to a study by the Trent Lott National Center at the University of Southern Mississippi that says restoring Amtrak service will boost tourism significantly greatly benefiting Mississippi’s beaches and casinos. They point to the report of a special Gulf Coast Working Group created by Congress that estimates the cost of resuming Gulf Coast passenger service at $5.4 million. They point to the fact that the Biden administration Amtrak and the state governments of Louisiana and Mississippi are all committed to furnishing the necessary operating funds.

But after five years of negotiations you still can’t take the train to Gulfport Biloxi Pascagoula or anywhere else along the Gulf Coast. CSX which controls most of the track along the route insists that restoring Amtrak service would interfere with the six to eight freight trains it runs daily along the coast. It’s an argument that rail corporations often deploy against passenger service.

The objection is absurd on its face. During World War II when troop and military freight trains crowded this route along with civilian freight traffic long since lost to trucks dispatchers still managed to move 11 scheduled passenger trains per day between Mobile and New Orleans. These included the storied “Pan American” of country music fame. And they did it using telegraphs and hand-operated semaphores not the efficient GPS technology available today.

CSX’s recalcitrance is a negotiating strategy to get Amtrak to either go away or pony up for huge infrastructure investments that would mostly benefit CSX itself. The railroad says restoring two Amtrak trains requires a second main track new sidings siding extensions yard bypasses and modernization of drawbridges. At one point CSX put the price tag at $2 billion—orders of magnitude more than estimates provided by the Federal Railway Administration and other independent experts.

Such maneuverings reflect the growing power of hedge funds and other “activist investors” over the railroad industry. In 2017 the financier Paul Hilal used his activist fund Mantle Ridge to buy a nearly $2 billion stake in CSX and win control of its board. Hilal used this power to depose CSX’s long-standing management and replace it with a team of downsizing specialists committed to boosting short-term profits by shrinking the railroad’s physical assets labor force and other expenses. The new focus on cost cutting and downsizing has seriously degraded CSX freight operations while also causing the company to take an impossibly hard line with Amtrak.

Exasperated by the railroads’ refusal to negotiate in good faith over the restoration of Gulf Coast service Amtrak has recently appealed to an independent federal agency the Surface Transportation Board. But deregulation has left the federal government with very limited control over railroad infrastructure. When Congress and the Nixon administration created Amtrak in 1970 they relieved railroad owners of their previous obligation to provide passenger service at their own expense. Half a century later the federal government has no clear legal standard to decide when freight railroads must grant Amtrak access to their track or what the terms of service will be. And since Amtrak owns track only between Boston and Washington and a few other places dependence on freight railroads is a huge obstacle to improving or expanding passenger rail service.

For example more than 10 years of studying and lobbying have been dedicated to the question of whether Amtrak will be permitted to run more than one round-trip train per day between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. Public policy makers must wrestle with many knotty problems; this shouldn’t be one of them. There’s plenty of track capacity. Amtrak ran two round-trip trains along the mostly three-track mainline as recently as 2004. But Norfolk Southern says today that bringing back that second train would create unworkable disruptions to its freight service. The railroad’s latest maneuver was to demand that the state of Pennsylvania pay for a study to calculate how much the public must pay Norfolk Southern for the necessary capital improvements such as a possible fourth track.

Another example is the drawn-out battle Amtrak and the public had to wage to restore passenger service between Boston and Portland Maine. By the time Amtrak came into being passenger service on the route had already been discontinued. To get it started again Amtrak as well as state and local governments had to agree to pay the railroad that owns the tracks tens of millions of dollars for capital improvements. It took another two years of litigation before the railroad now known as Pan Am would allow Amtrak to run its trains fast enough so people would want to ride them. A pending mergerbetween Pan Am and CSX now threatens the public’s considerable investment in that passenger route and any prospect of expanding Amtrak service elsewhere in New England.

Biden recently signed an executive order that commanded the Surface Transportation Board to put more pressure on railroads to stop their habitual practice of delaying Amtrak trains by making them wait for passing freight trains. That’s helpful. But the order failed to clarify what rights Amtrak possesses to expand service and what price it and other public entities must pay railroad owners for capital improvements. Because there’s no clear statutory authority some industry insiders predict that Amtrak’s legal fight to restore Gulf Coast passenger service will go all the way to the Supreme Court which could take years. State and local governments seeking to establish commuter rail service have even less legal leverage than Amtrak in negotiating terms with private railroad owners.

It’s much the same story when you consider the prospects for expanding freight rail service in the U.S. Don’t expect much progress unless we claw back Wall Street control.

There’s an overwhelming societal need to divert more freight from trucks to trains. Freight trains are three to five timesmore fuel efficient than trucks and produce far less emissions. Indeed when electrically powered by overhead wires trains can be emissions free and without the environmental and financial costs of battery disposal that plague electric trucks. According to one study a modest investment in electrifying freight railroads could reduce carbon emissions by 39 percent and by 2030 remove an estimated 83 percent of long-haul trucks from the road.

Moving more freight by rail would also reduce the number of Americans who are killed or injured by collisions with large trucks a casualty rate that reached 156000 in 2018. In addition it would reduce dramatically the damage done to America’s roads and highways by large trucks—each of which causes the same wear and tear as 9600 passenger cars.

Yet hedge funds private equity firms and other financiers are using their control of highly monopolized underregulated railroads not to expand rail freight but to sell off rail assets and hand over all but the highest-margin business to trucks.

Some of this downsizing is justified by the decline of the railroads’ thermal coal business as electric utilities convert to natural gas. But most of the downsizing results simply from financiers forcing railroads to shed all but their most lucrative lines of business. Such practices threaten to shrink the nation’s rail network to the point of nonviability but so long as rail expenses fall faster than rail revenues the short-term return on assets increases. That’s all Wall Street cares about.

The scale of the downsizing is dramatic. One measure is the rapid disappearance of boxcars. During the 10 years leading up to 2019 even as GDP increased by nearly 50 percent the railroad boxcar fleet shrank by one-third. Between 2000 and 2019 the trade journalist Bill Stephens reported the equivalent of 16132 merchandise freight trains each with 75 cars vanished from the tracks of CSX and Norfolk Southern. The main driver of this decline was an industry trend known as “demarketing” in which railroads actively turn away profitable but low-margin business—for example hauling grain or consumer appliances—if the move doesn’t involve huge volumes or requires boxcars to be hauled back empty. As a consequence many farmers now have to use expensive trucks to get their crops to market while many kinds of manufacturing become far more difficult if not impossible in the rapidly expanding number of towns and cities where the railroads will no longer do business.

Railroads are also making it more expensive and cumbersome for shippers to realize any advantage from combining shipment by truck with shipment by rail. Especially for trips over about 500 miles moving containers by both truck and train is much more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly than using trucks for the entire journey. During the 1980s and ’90s railroads won substantial market share back from trucks in some lanes by offering such intermodal service. But that was before Wall Street started demanding that railroads limit themselves to the highest-margin business.

Bowing to such pressure in 2018 Union Pacific and CSX discontinued their partnered service on 197 of 301 cross-country container train routes. As a consequence even shippers who still use railroads to ship containers wind up making much greater use of trucks. For example if a shipper wants to move a container from any number of western cities to Baltimore using Union Pacific and CSX CSX will no longer move the container the full distance. Rather CSX will only take it as far as Chambersburg Pennsylvania and then make the shipper hire a trucker to haul it the remaining 100 miles to Baltimore.

Railroads have also been stripping out terminal capacity. Wonder why it took so long to get that new car you ordered? The shortage of rail terminal space is a major reason for the widespread logistical bottlenecks since the economy began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July Union Pacific suspended container freight service from West Coast ports to Chicago for a week because it lacked the capacity to sort and redirect the boxes piling up there. The embargo immediately meant that still more boxes coming from Asia with everything from auto parts to transistors piled up on docks as West Coast ports waited for canceled trains. As the chain reaction continued the steamship line HMM warned customers to expect more delays and announced restrictions on loading containers bound for Chicago. The rail expert Larry Gross calculated that it would take 50 double-stack trains each carrying 800 20-foot containers to haul away the pileup caused by just one week of suspended rail service.

Why did this bottleneck occur? In large part because to appease Wall Street’s demands for higher margins Union Pacific had previously closed a major handling facility in Chicago known as Global III that it now desperately needed to keep the supply chain moving.

Wall Street has also pressured railroads into cutting expenses by reducing the frequency of freight service. If you live near railroad tracks or if you drive regularly over grade crossings you may have noticed that railroads run freight trains much less frequently nowadays and that the trains they do run can stretch as long as three miles. The industry refers to this as “PSR” or precision scheduled railroading. In practice PSR has nothing to do making trains run on precise schedules. The term was coined by the late E. Hunter Harrison a railroad executive who starting in the 1990s boosted railroad stock prices through radical downsizing. This made him the darling of hedge funds like Pershing Square Capital Management and Mantle Ridge.

PSR mostly just involves running fewer trains to fewer places using fewer employees while imposing all kinds of new fees on shippers. After Harrison implemented PSR at CSX Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific and other railroads imitated him and freight rail operations deteriorated nationwide. In 2019 Congress held hearings in which shippers relayed example after example of paying more for worse service. Since then CSX and other railroads have taken PSR still further by ripping out yards and laying off hard-to-replace employees such as locomotive mechanics and engineers. Between 2014 and 2019 before COVID had any impact the four largest railroads laid off 30000 mostly unionized workers.

The downsizing was so great that railroads can’t meet the post-pandemic surge of freight shipments. As a consequence still more freight will crowd onto the nation’s highways. “We can’t let hedge fund managers write the rules of railroading” complained Oregon Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio chairman of the House Transportation Committee in May as he called for an investigation into the way PSR has degraded railroad freight service.

Deregulation and a retreat from antitrust enforcement also feeds the financiers’ control over railroads. Since 1980 the number of major or Class I railroads has shrunk from 33 to seven—a number that will drop to six if a proposed merger between Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern wins regulatory approval. The result is that more shippers are served by only a single railroad. There are always trucks of course but some commodities (grain and chemicals for instance) are too heavy and bulky to move economically by truck for more than short distances.

Captive shippers once could depend on the Interstate Commerce Commission to protect them from predatory pricing but in 1980 the Carter administration and Congress stripped the government of almost all its practical ability to do so. The combination of deregulation and lax antitrust enforcement leaves railroads free to hike prices or degrade service standards.

The shippers’ loss has been the railroad stockholders’ gain. Less than three years after Mantle Ridge brought in Harrison to run CSX the railroad’s stock price doubled. Today its new CEO says he’s committed to growing the business—but that isn’t necessarily the railroad business. On his watch CSX bought a trucking company and used a $5 billion stock buyback program to raise the company’s stock price and fatten his own $15 million compensation package. The stock prices of other Class I railroads have also surged thanks to cost cutting that now allows railroads to spend less than 60 cents for every dollarthey take in as revenue.

This is the industry on which Congress and Biden propose to bestow $66 billion. To protect that investment we’ll need to do a lot more.

Government played an oversized role in building the nation’s railroads. Historically railroads operated under charters granted by state and local governments that required them to serve the public good. CSX’s tracks along the Gulf Coast for example were originally laid by a corporation created by an act of Alabama’s state legislature in 1866. The legislature gave this corporation government-like powers including eminent domain to acquire rights of way across the state. But in return the legislature stipulated that the line must be built and managed in a manner “best adapted to and for the public accommodation.”

This basic relationship between railroads and the public was codified into federal law in the late 19th century and lasted until the end of the 1970s. America’s early railroads received vast grants of public land and other direct subsidies that turned them into local or regional monopolies. In return American law treated them as quasi-public utilities subject to strict price regulation and the principle known as “common carriage” which prohibited them from turning away some customers or classes of business while favoring others.

As Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote for the majority in the 1898 case of Smyth v. Ames

A railroad is a public highway and nonetheless so because constructed and maintained through the agency of a corporation deriving its existence and powers from the state. Such a corporation was created for public purposes. It performs a function of the state. Its authority to exercise the right of eminent domain and to charge tolls was given primarily for the benefit of the public.

This led to railroads being heavily regulated first by state railroad commissions and then after 1887 by the Interstate Commerce Commission the first federal regulatory agency. The ICC came to wield enormous influence over industrial development by barring railroads from favoring one shipper industry city or region over another. The agency also compelled railroads to provide certain low-margin or even money-losing lines of business such as branch lines necessary to connect smaller cities and villages to the political and economic life of the nation. By controlling rates and terms of service the ICC also prevented price wars and other ruinous competition among railroads and gave them a legal vehicle to coordinate operating plans so freight and passengers could travel efficiently across more than one railroad.

Because of the ICC and the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 railroads in that era were subject to far more regulation and antitrust enforcement than railroads face today. That’s one big reason why late-19th- and early-20th-century rail tycoons like James Hill or E. H. Harriman concentrated on building and improving railroads rather than on predatory pricing and demarketing like today’s financiers.

This regulatory regime worked reasonably well until the mid-20th century. As the political scientist Samuel Huntingtonwould write in 1952 “During its sixty-five years of existence the Commission developed an enviable reputation for honesty impartiality and expertness.” But then it began falling apart. As advancing technology expanded transportation by automobile truck and air policy makers should have adjusted transportation policy to take advantage of potential synergies. They could have encouraged for example combining trains and trucks to move long-haul freight or trains and planes to reach out-of-the-way places. Instead funding was lavished on highway and airport construction.

A telling symbol of this imbalance is Washington’s monumental Union Station built by a consortium of railroads in the beginning of the 20th century. By the early 1960s the railroads were paying property taxes on the station of $350000 a year and an annual maintenance bill of more than $1 million even as they lost money on passenger train service mandated by the ICC. Meanwhile across the Potomac airlines availed themselves of the federally owned and operated National Airport—built expanded and operated by a tangle of federal agencies that included the Civil Aeronautics Board the Army Corps of Engineers and even the National Park Service.

This imbalance led to massive railroad bankruptcies in the 1970s. Washington at that point might have nationalized the railroads as nearly every other industrialized nation had done long before. Instead it bailed out railroad stockholders by allowing railroads to shed public responsibilities such as operating passenger trains and branch lines while allowing them to engage in a mad merger frenzy.

The strategy saved much of the industry from insolvency but at a tremendous cost to the public good. Since 1980 the nation has lost more than 40 percent of its rail mileage as many lines were ripped out that would be invaluable today as we struggle to decarbonize the economy and rationalize our transportation system. And once financiers twigged that Congress had turned railroads into unregulated monopolies answerable only to shareholders they swooped in and pressured rail management to adopt policies like PSR to further downsize and squeeze out the last drops of monopoly profit.

One solution to this mess would be to nationalize the railroads. The U.S. actually did this temporarily during World War I with many impressive results. Or we could nationalize only rail infrastructure leaving private companies to operate trains. This “open access” approach has shown promising results in Europe and it’s not all that different from how the Interstate Highway System works.

Alternatively we could take a “back to the future” approach once again treating railroads as utilities but paying better attention this time to coordinating regulation and subsidies among all transportation modes including new ones like drones and self-driving cars.

The one thing we shouldn’t do however if we want to preserve planet Earth and build back a transportation network that suits our needs is give the railroad industry more money without demanding that it serve the public interest. The looting has gone on long enough.

A final detail — applying yellow safety paint to the handrails — took place this week on the project which started earlier this fall. The carbody now wears a correct shade of PRR’s DGLE or Dark Green Locomotive Enamel – often referred to both officially and unofficially as Brunswick Green.

The project was accomplished for less than $5000 and with about 120 hours of volunteer labor according to Joe DeFrancesco executive director of the Railroaders Memorial Museum of Altoona which administers the landmark. Opened in 1992 the site as it now stands consists of a small museum gift shop and trackside viewing park. Earlier more casual versions of the park have existed since the 19th century.

Horseshoe Curve was opened to rail traffic on Feb. 15 1854 and has attracted tourists and railfans ever since for its innovative engineering solution to conquering a rise in elevation from 800 feet above sea level at Altoona to 2100 feet at the summit 12 miles distant. The Curve lies in the middle of that climb.

“I’m grateful to our supporters donors and visitors alike who have put faith in our new administration to help make a difference” DeFrancesco says. “With the GP9 I can’t remember when it looked this good this accurate — that goes to the credit of our volunteers who worked with [lettering] diagrams in our archives. We understand its importance not only for what it symbolizes with the PRR era at Horseshoe Curve but also for the many visitors who come to get pictures with their families in front of it.”

Work included the preparation of surfaces with hand tools and the welding of patches on the running boards. Volunteers and staff who helped with the project DeFrancesco said were Andrew Brumbaugh Andy Charlesworth Mark Frederick Miranda Harkins Joe Marks Mike Reindl and Collin Reinhart.

Delivered in December 1955 as PRR No. 7048 the unit was among the railroad’s order for the first 50 (PRR Nos. 7000-7049) of an eventual fleet of 310 GP9 units of which 270 were conventional units and 40 were cabless “B” units. PRR’s acquisition of these nine orders of GP9s from 1955 through 1959 allowed it to finally retire the last of its once-huge steam-locomotive fleet.

EMD’s GP9 model designation meant little to PRR officialdom which developed its own classification system for diesels as it had done when it designed and built thousands of steam and electric locomotives. On PRR a GP9 was an EFS-17m whose letters represented E for Electro-Motive as builder FS (Freight-Shifter or road switcher) for duty 17 for the unit’s 1750-horsepower rating and m for multiple-unit control.

No. 7048 passed through Penn Central (1968) and Conrail (1976) ownership with the same road number. When it was rebuilt as a Conrail unit the carbody was altered slightly but it retained its high short hood. Most rebuilt units on Conrail and elsewhere got a chopped-down short nose to enhance the engine crew’s range of vision.

The unit was placed at Horseshoe Curve on Sept. 16 1985 when the K4s-class 4-6-2 locomotive (PRR Juniata Shops 1918) No. 1361 displayed there since 1957 as a monument to the age of steam was removed to permit its restoration to operating condition. Under the museum’s reconstituted board and staff the engine is being rebuilt for operation again. (See “PRR K4s engine No. 1361 to be restored in $2.6 million campaign” Trains News Wire June 25 2021).

Winter hours funicular repairs

In other developments at the Curve and at the museum:

— For the first time since the visitor center opened in 1992 the museum has announced that in response to public demand Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark will be open on a limited basis during winter. Previously the site was closed annually from January through March. According to DeFrancesco the site will remain open from now to the end of 2021 on its normal Wednesday-to-Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule (closed holidays including Thanksgiving Christmas Day New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day). The site will then close until Jan. 14 when it will reopen Fridays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The museum also will be open on winter hours until April when both sites will resume a normal operating schedule. Unpredictable winter weather on the mountain means that the Curve site may be closed on short notice. In that case the information will be posted on the museum’s web site.

— The funicular passenger railway which has been out of service for many months will reopen soon following completion of a $50000 project to repair it and upgrade its electronic components. The railway consists of two 12-passenger cars that carry riders from street level to trackside offering an alternative to a walking journey of more than 120 stairway steps. DeFrancesco said the museum is awaiting final inspection and paperwork from the state Department of Labor and Industry which licenses elevators and similar conveyances in Pennsylvania. The project was funded by a grant from the North American Railway Foundation. Work was carried out by Leitner-POMA of America Inc. of Colorado successor to the gondola-and-chairlift firm that built it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYXN0cm93b3JsZC10cmFnZWR5LTUtdGhpbmdzLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtcmFwcGVyLXRyYXZpcy1zY290dC9hcnRpY2xlXzEwZDkwZmIzLTMyYmEtNTQ5Yi05MzZmLTU4ZWFlMTI5NjJlNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Astroworld tragedy: 5 things to know about rapper Travis Scott,"Memphis TN (38111)

The boardroom feud at Rogers Communications Inc. has highlighted shortcomings in how Canada regulates companies across the country a number of corporate governance experts said as they reacted to a recent court decision that appeared to bring an end to the saga.

Out-of-date rules they argued pose a problem at both the provincial and federal level and can allow undemocratic business practices to go unchecked.

“Rogers is a teachable moment for our corporate governance not keeping up with the times” said Richard Leblanc a governance professor at Toronto’s York University.

He said Friday’s ruling from the British Columbia Supreme Court which found that Edward Rogers has the right as head of the controlling Rogers family trust to replace independent directors without holding a shareholder meeting is a prime example.

“The most basic tenant of shareholder democracy is to vote for directors at the annual meeting.”

He said British Columbia is the only province where such an action would be allowed which also highlights the fact that Canada does not have a federal securities regulator to coordinate such rules. Key federal guidelines on corporate governance have also not been updated since 2005 making them “wholly inadequate” to cover current expectations around best practices he said.

Daniel Waeger Canada Research Chair in corporate governance at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo Ont. said independent directors should act as an important check in corporate governance and are a factor investors consider before committing their money.

He said that while a controlling shareholder could obviously replace independent directors at an annual meeting he still found it surprising that B.C. law would allow them to be replaced “so quickly so unceremoniously” as in the Rogers case.

“That’s a bit jarring because then all of these independent directors that just means it’s completely fair-weather structure in that fence” he said.

Edward Rogers was able to fire the directors because of the dual-class share structure at the company founded by his father. That structure sees the family trust he chairs controlling the vast majority of voting shares while institutions and average shareholders hold non-voting shares.

The dual-class structure is something the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance has long been pushing to change.

Catherine McCall the coalition’s executive director said in a recent editorial that dual-class shares violate the principles of fairness and accountability on which capital markets depend and that the creation of sustainable long-term value requires factoring in the interests of all corporate stakeholders.

She said the coalition advocates for some kind of sunset clause on dual share structures either making the separation dissolve after a certain amount of time or after certain events like the death of a founder. Alternatively the coalition argues for subjecting the structure to a periodic overall shareholder vote.

University of Alberta business professor Randall Morck said dual-class structures do have some uses especially in the fast-moving high-tech world where a company founder may have specialized knowledge. He said a longer-term investment horizon also helps but said dual-class setups become more problematic when they get handed down to a second or third generation.

“Then that concentrated power becomes much less defensible and often a problem” said Morck.

He said other countries have ways of putting limits on dual-class structures. He cited Israel which forces a company to combine the shares if they ever issue new ones as well as other jurisdictions where major decisions such as corporate takeovers have to be approved by both classes of shares.

Morck said the issue getting far less attention through the Rogers dispute is the use of family trusts in general which he says are used to reduce inheritance taxes and acts as the main tax loophole for the super rich in Canada.

“In a world where we worry about extreme inequality it might make sense for us to wonder kind of does the whole idea of a family trust really make sense in a democracy that’s committed to some elements of economic equality?”

A new wildlife habitat has been created by the National Trust for Scotland and Highland Conservation volunteers in a partnership with Raleigh International.

Several bog pools were dug out at Loch Achaidh na h-Inich on the Balmacara Estate in Lochalsh. The habitat aims to conserve the rare Northern Emerald dragonfly.

This breed of butterfly has been sighted breeding on the estate at the one remaining pool therefore new pools will provide further breeding grounds for the species’ expansion.

Volunteers helped create the new habitat.

Prior to digging the conservation charity’s senior natural heritage advisor Jeff Waddell surveyed the Collie Mhor Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) to determine the best location for the pools.

He said: “Without this work its habitat would disappear here as natural processes mean the fen would become covered in trees and too dry for the species to breed causing it to become extinct at this site.

“This wetland habitat is part of a site of special scientific interest designated as a safe haven for these amazing insects. A huge thanks to NatureScot for permitting this work British Dragonfly Society for advice and for all the volunteers that support the trust’s vital nature conservation programmes.”

The pools will be monitored for the next few seasons to gauge the results.

Isah Ayagi is a popular musician that is changing the narrative in the northern Nigeria music industry. In this interview with Daily Trust he speaks on what attracted him to music his plans for the future and sundry issues.

How did you start your music career?

I can say my music is more of a gift because I grew up singing. I remember when I was a small boy we used to sing poems in our Islamic school. And in those days there was a play we called ‘Tashe’ during Ramadan where children organize some kinds of plays to display their talent; and people will applaud them and even give them a token in appreciation. I and my friends would always compose poems and sing them to our audience.

After some years people started saying I have a special way of passing messages to people whenever I’m talking. So I realized that as a young boy I could use my talent of passing messages across to address some societal problems. That was how I opted for music. That was how it started and today we are still pushing.

I think I started music in our Islamic school in 2000.

Why did you choose music instead of other means of passing messages?

I told you I liked music from childhood. And I realized it will be easier for me to pass my message through music because many people irrespective of age will listen to me.

Who was your master when you were starting up?

As far as music is concerned I can’t categorically point out one person as my master. Perhaps I can say my Islamiyya teachers were the ones that encouraged me to keep going after they noticed my talent.

And now that I have grown relatively big in the industry I give my elder brother who is more knowledgeable and more vast than me to cross-check my lyrics before I go to the studio.

Which of your song is your best and why?

My best song is ‘Mutu ka raba’ and the reason is that it opened many doors for me that seemed to be closed. I sang many songs before ‘Mutu ka raba’ but other musicians claimed them indirectly. I say indirectly because it was the people that listened to my song that gave the applause to others. And to my dismay when some of my colleagues were approached by people that they had listened to their songs instead of telling them the truth they claim the songs. But from ‘Mutu ka raba’ that stopped and people started knowing the truth and began to appreciate me.

Another thing is that the message in that song is unique. That is the reason I think it is still very relevant. People still play it at events and in houses.

There is your song ‘Ashe da aurenki’ where you pointed out how you fell in love on social media not knowing that the lady is a soldier’s wife was it a real-life story?

I told you earlier that music is a way of passing message to address societal problems. Something similar to the issue I raised in ‘Ashe da aurenki’ happened but I added many things to capture the scenario better.

The aim of the music is to address the problem of how nowadays you will see a married woman socializing freely with everybody on social media and at the end she may make friends and start chatting with them. Before you know it they are close friends. And I was surprise the message was widely received.

Fans are saying they are not hearing from you again why?

Well it is partially true. But even the song you talked about ‘Ashe da aurenki’ I released not long ago. My main concern is the message I am passing to the world not the number of songs I release. That is why I always use my time to compose something special that my people will appreciate. People will agree with me seeing that songs I released many years ago are still relevant because I did the right thing. That is my style. And next year my fans should expect many special packages.

You are known to be very close to Hamisu Breaker. You sang many songs together such as the blockbuster ‘Bakar Gizo’ that got more than 2 million views on YouTube. Are you still friends?

Yeah. Hamisu Breaker is my friend. We still maintain that professional relationship.

Fans are saying you are somehow very simple among Northern celebrities; Is that true?

Simplicity and humility are traits of our family. I got it directly from my parents. I have that notion that since I was nobody I have no reason to look down upon anyone now because I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.

Which Southern musicians do you want to collaborate with?

I want to collaborate in the nearest future with Davido Korede Bello and Burna Boy and many others.

But why are your Southern counterparts richer than those of you in the North?

This question is very important. I have been asking myself similar question. I concluded that it is due to lack of proper management. We don’t have managers that manage our affairs where as in the South they all have managers. Here we don’t know that.

Another factor is that our people do not appreciate our talent. If for example there is a wedding here in the North you will be surprise to see that they’d invite a Southern musician and give him like say N5m for a few minutes’ performance. And if they invited a Northern musician they will pay him like say N70000 for many hours performance. It is high time we start appreciating our own.

Between CD and YouTube which one is better?

CD is better. But we don’t have option now than to be using the YouTube pending what will happen next.

Any message to your fans?

My main aim is to keep entertaining them with my sweet lyrics especially the ones that are about love. I believe in love so I will never fail lovers. They should keep watching I will never fail them.

Well it almost happened!

The versatile fourth-generation F-16 has been a mainstay in the US Air Force’s arsenal for over four decades now. USAF operates around 1245 F-16s out of over 4600 operational across the world. It took its maiden flight in 1974.

The Lockheed Martin-General Dynamics aircraft is in active service with the Israeli Air Force Pakistan Air Force Turkish Air Force Egyptian Air Force Royal Netherlands Air Force Royal Norwegian Air Force Belgian Air Component among other users.

How Hornet Ruined Falcon’s Prospects?

After visible success with USAF the US Navy too was keen on developing a carrier-capable F-16. However despite Navy-specific modifications the naval variant of the F-16 never saw the light of the day.

The competition for a lucrative contract between what we know as the Fighting Falcon and Hornet family was chronicled by Alex Hollings in the Sandboxx News.

The F-16 which is the brainchild of General Dynamics was initially designated as the YF-16 when it was competing with Northrop Grumman’s YF-17 (operationally inducted as F/A-18 Hornet.)

The YF-17 was a lightweight prototype which was projected as a cheaper alternative to the F-15 Eagle one of the most sophisticated air-superiority fighters during that era.

While the USAF preferred YF-16 to YF-17 both General Dynamics and Northrop Gruman soon geared up for a carrier-capable fighter deal for the US Navy which saw potential in what would later become F-16.

Both the competing aerospace giants never made carrier-borne fighters before. However the prospect of a potential big-ticket contract sprang both firms into action. Each teamed up with companies that had the technological know-how and experience with aircraft carriers.

General Dynamics brought Vought onboard to upgrade their F-16 platform into the ‘Vought Model 1600’. Northrop Grumman collaborated with McDonnell Douglas to convert their YF-17 into a navy fighter which went on to become the F/A-18 Hornet.

Prerequisites set by the US Navy included long-range radar for intercept missions and multi-role capabilities which had become a core facet of American air warfare.

The F-16 was originally conceptualized to serve as a simple fighter intended for air superiority roles. The Falcons made their transition into a multi-role aircraft following a series of events during the development process.

Holling described an incident involving the ‘Lightweight Fighter Mafia’ a moniker given to the F-16s designers at General Dynamics. The designers had aimed to retain the aircraft’s “gold-plating”. They felt that this would remain universal in new fighter aircraft.

This “gold plating” consisted of fire control radar electronic countermeasures radar-guided missiles ground-attack capabilities and other features typically associated with a standard fourth-fifth generation fighter these days. The Falcon was outfitted with AN/APG-66 radar along with other additions bolstering its ground-attack capabilities.

However the aircraft lacked radar-guided air-to-air weapons which were foregone in preference of heat-seeking Sidewinder missiles. These collective enhancements made the F-16 far more suitable for the US Navy’s needs. The F-16 had surpassed expectations however despite its best efforts could not make the cut.

Why Did F-16 Fail?

The Vought 1600 was around three feet longer than the F-16A. The aircraft was two feet broader than the USAF version.

The naval variant sported a wingspan of 33 feet and three inches. The overall breadth of the wings reached 269 feet. This allowed the aircraft to maintain stability when flying at lower speeds.

Additionally the jet’s fuselage was slightly flattened in order to make it broader. Its canopy was specifically designed to ensure that it would pivot forward. This feature was distinct from the F-16 (however is now common on the F-35 platform).

The aircraft’s heavy-duty landing gears were required to be fixed to the aircraft’s belly along with other carrier-based equipment like a landing hook. The fuselage itself was made stronger and in order to offer the engagement range the Navy needed a pulse-doppler radar for beyond visual range targeting was also added.

All of these upgrades were required to convert the aircraft into a carrier-capable fighter and in accordance with the navy’s needs.

However despite the modifications the F-16 lost the battle to the YF-17. While the Hornet may not have been cut out to meet USAF’s operational needs the aircraft did fit into the US Navy’s carrier vision and has served America’s maritime interests with distinction.

The biggest drawback of the Vought 1600 was its low-lying intake located above the aircraft’s nose wheel which sparked a major cause of concern with regards to safety on the carrier’s flight deck as unsuspecting sailors could get sucked into it. No wonder that the prototype was infamously dubbed “Gator” for the risk it posed to sailors.

Furthermore the F-16’s lack of radar-specific weapons and lightweight meant that it was virtually unsuitable for all-weather operations like intercepting enemy fighter aircraft or hostile bombers flying towards a carrier strike group.

Schlesinger And His Lobby

Then-Defense Secretary James Schlesinger was reportedly hell-bent on ensuring the Vought 1600 be inducted into the US Navy despite reservations from the Navy’s top brass. Schlesinger had invited Admiral Holloway to discuss the Navy’s future fighter and put the issue to bed for good.

Adm. Holloway recounted in his book that he was ambushed by the Defense Secretary who had amassed over a dozen individuals to pitch the Vought 1600 to the US Navy. However Adm. Holloway continued to cite the concerns relayed by his engineers even as the lobbyists argued that those challenges could be mitigated with better pilot techniques.

These arguments however did not hold water as they were detached from operational reality. Compared to the Vought 1600 the YF-17 offered a second engine which made the difference between having to dump an aircraft at sea and making a relatively smooth landing aboard the aircraft carrier.

If similar capabilities were pitched and successfully demonstrated by the Vought 1600 the Fighting Falcon would very well be the navy’s mainstay carrier-borne fighter a position held by the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet for the past 40 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL3N0dWRlbnRzLWFyZS1wdXNoaW5nLXVzLWNvbGxlZ2VzLXRvLXNldmVyLXRpZXMtd2l0aC1taWxpdGFyeS1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWNvbXBsZXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Students Are Pushing US Colleges to Sever Ties With Military-Industrial Complex,"The violence wreaked by U.S. wars since 9/11 has been immense — more than 929000 total deaths including an estimated 380000 civilian deaths. And the U.S. has spent a staggering $14 trillion in Pentagon expenditures since the Afghanistan War in 2001 up to one-half of which went directly to defense contractors like Boeing Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman General Dynamics and Raytheon.

While these facts are outrageous they aren’t surprising in a country built on colonial violence — a country whose power and expansion are derived from war-making with such militarism being grounded in every institution arising from the state including education.

Students and young people are witnesses to the ways in which the U.S. education system is deeply complicit with war and militarism and in increasing numbers we are demanding change. As student organizers with Dissenters — a national movement that is building local teams of young people across the country and mobilizing to reclaim our resources from the war industry reinvest in life-giving institutions and repair collaborative relationships with the earth and people around the world — we were part of a weeklong effort at the end of October in which students at 16 campuses across the country rose up to unite around three central demands: 1) Universities must divest all holdings and cut all ties from the top five U.S. war profiteers: Boeing Lockheed Martin Northrump Grumman Raytheon and General Dynamics; 2) All cops off of all campuses; 3) All recruiters off all campuses.

Such a statement lies at the heart of Dissenter’s organizing and the Dissenter’s overall “Divest from Death” campaign which helps students mobilize against any war-making institutions their schools may be invested in. In fact U.S. colleges and universities are complicit in lining the pockets of war profiteers and overall defense contractors. Colleges like American University award lucrative board positions to war profiteers like Wesley Bush the former CEO of Northrop Grumman; and just this February a $75 million donation from major shareholders of General Dynamics — the Crown Family — was approved by the University of Chicago’s newly renamed Crown Family School of Social Work Policy and Practice. Meanwhile hundreds of other U.S. universities continue to renew contracts with U.S. defense companies to fund and fuel internship programs arts and cultural buildings on campus and to maintain a steady STEM-to-war pipeline at the nation’s top engineering schools.

With the clear stake that U.S. institutions have in perpetuating endless war it’s no wonder that young people at colleges across the country are rising up to demand our schools sever ties with the military-industrial complex.

The rising momentum of antiwar organizing among students was especially apparent on Oct. 25-31 during the Dissenters Divest from Death Week of Action as young people from Chicago to Washington D.C to California to Hawaii explicitly centered humanity over profit by disrupting “business as usual” at their institutions through direct action.

Students Fight Investment in Militarism

On October 11 the University of California Berkeley (UC Berkeley) sent out an email to its student body proudly claiming that its city was one of the first to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day in the United States and asking students to research and acknowledge the land we are on to honor the day. All the while the University of California and CalTech have received upwards of $300 million to build the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project located on Mauna Kea Hawaii. – a project that has been actively opposed by Indigenous Hawaiian protesters. Mauna Kea is a sacred place and to build a large telescope on top of it would be a desecration. While protesting the construction of TMT on their land Indigenous Hawaiians including elders have been met with arrests by settler-state police and threats of even greater violence including the calling in of the National Guard. Where is the honor in ignoring and trampling over the calls being made by Indigenous Hawaiians to put a stop to the development?

Hawaii Dissenters (@hawaiidissenters)

Now more than ever UC Berkeley students are building coalitions with organizers throughout Hawaii as they fight to protect Mauna Kea from TMT. However they are not the only university contributing to the construction of TMT. In fact Punahele Kutzen a student organizer of Hawaii Dissenters in Manoa emphasizes that while the University of California is a full partner in the construction of TMT “so many universities are direct profiteers of this desecration” including the California Institute of Technology and Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) associate schools like Johns Hopkins Yale and more.

Student organizers involved with the Hawaii Dissenters in particular have continued to make their resistance to such funding and imperialism known against this construction as well as various other forms of desecration on Hawaiian land. During the Divest from Death Week of Action Hawaii Dissenters’ main focus was on highlighting the climate imperialism resulting from the U.S. military’s ongoing occupation of Hawaii.

Students and young people are witnesses to the ways in which the U.S. education system is deeply complicit with war and militarism and in increasing numbers we are demanding change.

Stressing the imminent threat to the water supply and ecosystem by the Navy’s underwater missile testing and fuel tanks Hawaii Dissenters directly confronted military officials and settler state politicians about their role in Red Hill — a military fuel storage facility in Hawaii.

Conducting a community teach-in titled “Red Hill 101” as part of a coalition of O’ahu-based Water Protectors Hawaii Dissenters also made public comments at last week’s Red Hill Task Force Meeting in which they challenged the military and state’s claims of national security as justification for poisoning O’ahu waters and overall Hawaiian land. Beyond their week of action Kutzen clarifies that Hawaii Dissenters are “continuing to plant pilina [relationship or union] and build connections with folks from the ground up connecting with ʻĀina [the land] as we fight for genuine security.”

In Chicago students at University of Chicago have been fighting a different battle against their institution’s direct investment within militarism and destruction. University of Chicago Dissenters spent their week of action partnering up with #CareNotCops and other student organizations to protest Paul Alivisatos’s inauguration as president of UChicago.

“President Alivisatos may be a new face but he is beholden to the same donors billionaire trustees” said a representative of #CareNotCops who wished to remain anonymous.

Alivisatos proposed 10 “vectors and culture of engagement” for his new direction of the University — but none of them promises true change.

“The vectors do not denounce UChicago’s active role in domestic militarism through CPD and the University of Chicago Police Department where ‘engagement’ is the harassment and surveillance of our Black neighbors and peers. Nor do they address UChicago’s role in international militarism — in fact these ‘vectors’ only mention an expansion of UChicago’s investment portfolio which currently includes four of the five largest weapons manufacturers in the country (Boeing Lockheed Martin General Dynamics and Raytheon) and other war profiteers” said the representative.

History shows us that “elite” U.S. schools like UChicago do and will — without apology — displace and demolish whole swaths of Black neighborhoods fund warfare and deforestation through investing multibillion-dollar endowments bust unions steal wages force out disabled students and sexual assault survivors send cops to shoot those in crisis harass Black neighbors with private police forces and more as it suits its financial interests.

“That’s why we want the university to divest precious money and resources from the UChicago Police Department and invest in funding #EthnicStudiesNow #CulturalCentersNow and #ReparationsNow for the South-Siders whose lives have been affected by university expansion” said Nico Emmanuel-Henderson a Dissenters organizer at UChicago.

Students Fight the Revolving Door Between the University and the Military

Besides direct investment in funding and research to war-making institutions universities have other insidious ways of ingraining militarism in the school structure. Most prominently these include recruitment to military and policing programs like the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) which often have a major presence on our campuses. Programs like the ROTC often offer students money in grants and scholarships — or even payment of future scholarly endeavors — if they were to sign up. Such promises ensure a steady stream of college students — who too often struggle to pay for outrageous tuition on top of the other crucial resources like books food rent and more — to participate in and perpetuate violent militarism and oppression.

Moreover recruitment looks like universities making space for weapons-manufacturing companies to scout out potential employees on campuses both formally and informally. At schools like Howard University (HU) Lockheed Martin is especially prominent and has been targeting Howard’s Black student population to “diversify” its own team and staff. In other words the company is searching for Black computer science engineering and business majors — science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) students — to contribute in doing the work of militarism and oppression.

We won’t stop until we turn the tide against war and militarism.

But when we consider this horrific STEM-to-militarism pipeline it leads us to the important question of who is behind such recruitment strategies and what stakes they have in militarism. Too often higher-ups at universities who approve or even advocate for programs that benefit militarism have a deep connection and thus fealty to war-making and militarism.

American University Dissenters (@audissenters)

American University (AU) most recently approved Wesley Bush — former CEO of the weapons-manufacturing company Northrop Grumman — to the Board of Trustees in January 2021 leading to a school-wide campaign against him. For their Divest from Death Week AU Dissenters organized a “trick or treat” canvassing event to garner more signatures on their petition to remove Bush from their Board and orchestrated a banner drop within the School of International Service — the most renowned department at American University. On top of on-campus organizing AU Dissenters dedicated this week and beyond to standing in solidarity with Howard University students organizing the Blackburn Takeover. In fact for almost a month now HU students have been protesting their hazardous dorm living conditions– including mold roaches and vermin– by occupying their Blackburn Student Center. Students’ list of demands include a meeting with the Howard administration full academic disciplinary and legal immunity that student rights to vote for the Board of Trustees be reinstated and a legitimate housing plan. As temperatures continue to drop and with the Howard administration continuing to antagonize them student protesters rely on outside sources for food encampment materials and things to keep warm. For the week of action AU Dissenters was able to raise enough money to purchase a generator for them and are making weekly supply runs for students at Blackburn “for however long it takes.”

AU students are making strides in their organizing and have even caught the attention of other administrative members. In fact in response to students sending letters for Bush’s removal American’s University’s current president (and former Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Obama administration) Sylvia Burwell sent an email to students about Bush’s presence on the board saying “Members of the Board of Trustees represent a wide range of backgrounds and experiences all of which are critically important for advancing the university’s mission. Wes Bush’s extensive experience in the corporate and philanthropic sectors will augment the board’s efforts and contribute to our work and our community.”

Burwell is right about one thing: Board of Trustees members play a crucial role in advancing the university’s missions. In fact the Board of Trustees is a critical structure in university administration as it controls the development of the school’s overall objective school policies and how money can be used to implement these programs and policies. In other words the Board of Trustees handles where students’ money goes and how that money is used. So when the board has vested interests in war and militarism we must recognize how this can and does take precedence over the needs of students attending the university.

Mya Franklin a member of Northwestern University’s chapter of Dissenters emphasized this in a statement made during the Divest from Death Week of Action: “Divesting from militarism is deeply personal because there are people on the Board of Trustees at Northwestern that have not only the power but the ability to provide services like stipends for low-income students expansion of CAPS [Counseling and Psychological Services the school’s primary mental health service] viable avenues to support survivors of [sexual assault] but they don’t. Instead they are actively fueling death and destruction.”

Northwestern University Dissenters / @wearenudissenters

The Board of Trustees members Franklin is talking about include Phebe Novakovic the former CEO of General Dynamics as well as Dennis Muilenburg whose developments as the former CEO of Boeing include creating weapons used by the Israeli military to massacre Palestinians. Northwestern Dissenters were quick to call this out in their week of action doing a banner drop and flyering their Research and Technology building with posters reminding students of how these board members and the institution as a whole are actively fueling death and destruction.

The work to purge university administrations of war criminals isn’t easy. After all these are powerful individuals whose connections and resources can be weaponized to terrorize all opposition — even if they are young students. And with these profiteers being well-integrated (and monetarily beneficial) to the internal administrative structure universities will do anything to protect them. Most of the time this includes harassing and surveilling students on campus.

As a member of the American University Dissenters I (Ngakiya Camara) personally recall instances of being surveilled on campus and have been agitating against AU’s practice of doing nothing to protect Black students on campus while simultaneously doing everything to protect Wes Bush.

Meanwhile Mya Franklin of Northwestern Dissenters recalls being harassed by Northwestern University Police Department (NUPD) officers while doing the banner drop and flyering stating “Someone ripped down one of our posters as it was drying. [A] NUPD pig pulled up and harassed us. That morning we all acutely experienced militarism as we were fighting for anti-militarism.”

So long as universities are prepared to prioritize the role of war criminals on our campus over the livelihood of their students these instances will persist. And as long as powerful war profiteers occupy crucial administrative positions like the Board of Trustees resources meant for students will be used to strengthen the lucrative ties that these profiteers have to the institutions they worked for and are invested in. But even in the face of powerful war profiteers we will not be silent.

Our universities which boast to be hubs of progressiveness and inclusivity partner with the very same death institutions that perpetuate imperialism and settler-colonialism. From their direct investments in research for colonial constructions like TMT in Hawaii or cops in Chicago to their approval of war profiteers to their Board of Trustees these instances too often happen behind closed doors beyond the watchful gaze of students whose lives are threatened by these systems of militarism. But we — students and folks impacted by U.S. militarization — are watching and recognize the power we have in faltering the systems of violence our universities strive to maintain.

It’s now time for universities to recognize us and our demands for them to divest from death. From Washington D.C. to California to Hawaii we are seeing other young people mobilizing on their campuses to call for their schools to sever ties with the military-industrial complex. We won’t stop until we turn the tide against war and militarism.

Barcelona have appointed Xavi as their new manager on a two-and-a-half-year deal.

The former midfielder who spent 17 years in the Barcelona first team between 1998 and 2015 joins from Qatari outfit Al Sadd after the two clubs had agreed on the payment of a release clause in his contract.

“FC Barcelona have reached an agreement with Xavi Hernandez for him to become first-team coach for the rest of the current season and two more seasons” the Catalan club said on its official website.

“Xavi Hernandez a youth-team product at Barca has left his current club Al Sadd of Qatar after talks held over the last few days with the owners of the club.”

The 41-year-old who progressed through Barcelona’s La Masia academy will be unveiled at a press conference on Monday.

Xavi a World Cup and double European Championship winner with Spain is one of the most decorated players in Barcelona’s history.

He won 25 major trophies at the Nou Camp including eight LaLiga titles and four Champions Leagues.

Xavi made 767 appearances for Barcelona a club record until the mark was beaten by Lionel Messi.

He joined Al Sadd in 2015 initially as a player and coached the team to seven different trophies.

Barcelona sacked Ronald Koeman last month and are currently ninth in LaLiga having won only four of their 11 games.

Welcome to Scott’s Astroworld Festival - where concertgoers can become their rebellious selves.

Tragically the Grammy-nominated rapper’s energetic show this time turned deadly after at least eight people -- between the ages of 14 and 27 -- were killed during a crowd surge at his music festival in Houston on Friday evening. A sizable group of the 50000 in attendance pushed toward the stage at NRG Park as a timer clicked down to start the performance before the chaotic scene began to ignite.

People in the crowd reported lots of pushing and shoving during the performances leading up to Scott’s set -- which is normal at his shows. He’s often encouraged fans to bypass security and rush the stage but none of those previous situations resulted in fatalities.

“Travis Scott’s whole aesthetic is about rebellion” said HipHopDX editor-in-chief Trent Clark who has attended several of his performances. “The shows have a lot of raging. With the death of punk rock hip-hop has indeed adopted and patterned the new generation of mosh pits. It’s not uncommon to see a lot of crowding and raging or complete wild behavior at a Travis Scott show.”

Scott is an eight-time Grammy-nominated rapper who is music’s biggest young stars. The Houston-born musician founded his festival in 2018 on the heels of his chart-topping album “Astroworld” which was led by the infectious song “Sicko Mode.” He also has a 3-year-old daughter with Kylie Jenner who announced in September that she is pregnant with their second child.

“Travis Scott is legendary in the hip-hop community for his beyond high-energy performances where he really tries to rile up the crowd” said Noah Shachtman editor-in-chief at Rolling Stone. “That makes for some really fun shows and made for a couple of scary incidents.”

In a tweet posted Saturday Scott said he was “absolutely devastated by what took place last night.” He pledged to work “together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need.”

No matter where the investigation ultimately leads tragedies like the one at the Astroworld Festival have been happening for a long time. In 1979 11 people died in a scramble to enter a Cincinnati Ohio concert by The Who. At a soccer stadium in England a human crush in 1989 led to nearly 100 deaths. In 2015 a collision of two crowds at the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia caused more than 2400 deaths based on an Associated Press count of media reports and officials’ comments.

But with Scott getting into trouble before for the two past shows Shachtman thinks the rapper will get a “hard second look.”

In 2017 Scott was arrested after he encouraged fans to bypass security and rush the stage leaving a security guard a police officer and several other injured during a concert in Arkansas. In a separate incident he was sentenced to one year of court supervision after pleading guilty to reckless conduct charges stemming from a 2015 incident in Chicago at the Lollapalooza music festival.

At the time Chicago officials said Scott encouraged fans to vault security barricades. However no one was injured.

“In terms of energy he wants the energy he’s giving out on stage to be reciprocated from the audience almost in defiance” said Julian Kimble who wrote a concert review on Scott’s 2018 Astroworld performance for the Washington Post. He called the rapper one of the most electrifying performers he’s seen.

“I’ve seen him tell people like ‘Don’t listen to security. Forget security. This is for y’all. This is for the fans’” he continued. “With regards to last night that’s an example of how things can go wrong. There’s a lot of negligence across the board. I don’t think there’s one bad guy or culprit. It’s a sweeping structural failure with what happened.”

Shachtman said he hopes the tragedy will help tweak Scott’s approach toward his show. He enjoys the rapper’s performances but wants a safer atmosphere where people can still have fun –- especially for those eager to find some enjoyment at live shows during the pandemic.

“I would expect that they’ll be increased measures to make sure concertgoers can have a great time but do so without getting killed” said Shachtman who grew up on New York hardcore punk rock music. He said that he’s no stranger to mosh pits but he adds that “there’s a big difference between a mosh pit even a giant one and a life-threating situation.”

Scott is scheduled headliner for the Day N Vegas Festival next weekend. But any performance involving Scott could come under some scrutiny for crowd control measures and other safety concerns.

“Concert promoters pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for security at both private and public (events)” Shachtman said. “That’s got to be deployed properly. Or else we’re going to see another one of these incidents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndidXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMS8wNi84LXBlb3BsZS1raWxsZWQtYXQtaG91c3RvbnMtYXN0cm93b3JsZC1mZXN0aXZhbC1hZnRlci1jcm93ZC1ydXNoZWQtdGhlLXN0YWdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 people killed at Houston's Astroworld Festival after crowd rushed the stage,"The crowd at a Houston music festival suddenly surged toward the stage during a performance by rapper Travis Scott squeezing fans so tightly together that they could not breathe or move their arms witnesses said Saturday hours after at least eight people died in the chaos.

The Houston mayor says the eight people killed in the crowd surge at a music festival ranged in age from 14 to 27 and 13 people are still hospitalized.

Mayor Sylvester Turner said Saturday that the disaster on Friday night was “a tragedy on many different levels” and that it is too early to draw conclusions about what went wrong.

Witnesses said the crowd surged toward the stage during a performance by rapper Travis Scott. The movement squeezed fans so tightly together that some could not breathe or move their arms.

The pandemonium unfolded at Astroworld a sold-out two-day event at NRG Park. An estimated 50000 people were in attendance.

Niaara Goods 28 said the crowd surged as a timer clicked down to the start of the performance.

“As soon as he jumped out on the stage it was like an energy took over and everything went haywire. All of a sudden your ribs are being crushed. You have someone’s arm in your neck. You’re trying to breathe but you can’t” Goods said.

Goods said she was so desperate to get out that she bit a man on the shoulder to get him to move.

Houston Fire Chief Samuel Peña said the crowd's movement toward the stage caused panic and some injuries. Then “people began to fall out become unconscious and it created additional panic.” Scores of people were hurt.

Experts who have studied deaths caused by crowd surges say they are often a result of density — too many people packed into a small space. The crowd is often running either away from a perceived threat or toward something they want such as a performer before hitting a barrier.

G. Keith Still a visiting professor of crowd science at the United Kingdom's University of Suffolk has testified as an expert witness in court cases involving crowds. He said he usually does not look at eyewitness reports when in the early stages of analyzing an incident because emotions can cloud the picture and witnesses can see only what’s immediately around them.

The deaths called to mind a 1979 concert by The Who where 11 people died as thousands of fans tried to get into Cincinnati’s Riverfront Coliseum. Other past crowd catastrophes include the deaths of 97 people in an overcrowded Hillsborough Stadium in 1989 in Sheffield England and numerous disasters connected with the annual hajj in Saudi Arabia.

People in the Houston crowd reported lots of pushing and shoving during the performances leading up to Scott’s set.

Then when Scott took the stage the crowd seemed to rush to the front trying to get closer to the stage said Nick Johnson a high school senior from the Houston suburb of Friendswood who was at the concert with friends.

“Everyone was passing out around you and everyone was trying to help each other. But you just couldn’t move. You couldn’t do anything. You can’t even pick your arms up” Johnson said. “It just got worse and worse.""

Johnson said fans started to crush each other and people started screaming. He said it felt like 100 degrees in the crowd.

Scott seemed to be aware that something was going on in the crowd but he might not have understood the severity of the situation Johnson said.

On video posted to social media Scott could be seen stopping the concert at one point and asking for aid for someone in the audience: “Security somebody help real quick.”

In a tweet posted Saturday Scott said he was “absolutely devastated by what took place last night."" He pledged to work ""together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need.”

Houston Police Executive Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite who was near the front of the crowd said the surge “happened all at once.”

“Suddenly we had several people down on the ground experiencing some type of cardiac arrest or some type of medical episode” Satterwhite said. “And so we immediately started doing CPR and moving people right then.""

Satterwhite said promoters quickly agreed to end the event ""in the interest of public safety.”

Amy Harris a freelance photographer for The Associated Press described an “aggressive” crowd atmosphere throughout the day because of the way fans were behaving — pushing and rushing the stage barricades and prohibited VIP and admission areas.

“It was definitely the most chaotic festival environment that I’ve been in” Harris said. “I felt uneasy all day.”

She got trapped behind a barricade while photographing performer Don Toliver because about 300 fans rushed the area. They ended up behind the security barricade with her.

“Everyone was passing out around you and everyone was trying to help each other. But you just couldn’t move. You couldn’t do anything. You can’t even pick your arms up.” Nick Johnson high school senior and concert-goer

She encountered a similar scene at a different stage for the main act. She left the media pit after three songs because of the disorder which resulted in people being pulled over the security barricade to receive medical attention.

At one point Gerardo Abad-Garcia was pressed so tightly into the crowd that he could not move his arms off his chest. During Toliver’s performance which came before Scott’s appearance he started getting concerned for his safety.

“I just couldn’t breathe. I was being compressed” he said. A security guard helped him and others climb a fence and get out.

He described the crowd during Scott's set as a wave that was “going forward and backward.""

Some people lost their shoes and the ground was littered with clothing and trash. He said some people tried to help those who were passed out on the ground while other concertgoers seemed to ignore them and continued watching the show.

After Scott’s concert Abad-Garcia saw medical personnel performing CPR on someone who appeared to be unconscious as the person was taken away on a golf cart.

Authorities did not disclose the causes of death and the dead were not immediately identified.

Scott one of music’s biggest young stars founded the Astroworld Festival in 2018. The 29-year-old Houston native has been nominated for eight Grammy Awards. He has a 3-year-old daughter with Kylie Jenner who announced in September that she’s pregnant with their second child.

Drake joined Scott on-stage at the concert which was livestreamed by Apple Music.

HOUSTON (KABC) -- A Southern California man who was among the concertgoers at a Houston music festival where a crowd surge resulted in the death of eight people is providing insight into what it was like for fans that got caught up in the chaos.

The pandemonium unfolded Friday evening at Astroworld a sold-out two-day event in NRG Park with an estimated 50000 people in attendance. As a timer clicked down to the start of a performance by rapper Travis Scott the crowd pushed forward.

""The crowd started pushing so people started falling and in my head I was just thinking: 'If you fall you die. Just please don't fall'"" said Lucas Naccarati of Arcadia.

He described a chilling ordeal as he desperately tried to escape and help others who were around him.

""There was a girl next to me that was just screaming: 'Please help me. I can't breathe I need to get out of here.' Her boyfriend couldn't really help her so I just really tried everything I could to get them out of there.""

Astroworld victims: What we know about 8 killed during Travis Scott performance

A ninth grader a 16-year-old and a 21-year-old were among the eight victims who died Friday night at NRG Park according school administrators and family.

Naccarati says he was pushed up against the crowd and felt multiple body parts.

""Unfortunately I had to just step on anything I could or I was going to fall.""

An Apple livestream shows Scott stopping his performance several times after spotting fans in distress.

One attendee said that as a timer clicked down to the start of Scott's performance the crowd pushed forward.

""As soon as he jumped out on the stage it was like an energy took over and everything went haywire"" concertgoer Niaara Goods said. ""All of a sudden your ribs are being crushed. You have someone's arm in your neck. You're trying to breathe but you can't.""

""I just want to send out prayers to the to the ones that was lost last night"" he said. ""I mean I'm honestly just devastated. I could never imagine anything like this just happening.""

Whether you’re planning to build a state-of-the art gaming PC a mining rig to convert your kilowatt-hours into cryptocoins or are simply experimenting with machine-learning AI you should be prepared to shell out quite a bit more money for a proper GPU than in the good old days.

Bargains are still to be had in the second-hand market though. [Devon Bray] chanced upon a pair of Nvidia Tesla K80 cards which are not suitable for gaming and no longer cost-effective for mining crypto but ideal for [Devon]’s machine-learning calculations. However he had to make a modification to enable proper thermal management as these cards were not designed to be used in regular desktop PCs.

The reason for this is that many professional-grade GPU accelerators are installed in rack-mounted server cases and are therefore equipped with heat sinks but no fans: the case is meant to provide a forced air flow to carry away the card’s heat. Simply installing the cards into a desktop PC case would cause them to overheat as passive cooling will not get rid of the 300 W that each card pumps out on full load.

[Devon] decided to make a proper thermal solution by 3D printing a mount that carries three fans along with an air duct that snaps onto the GPU card. In order to prevent unnecessary fan noise he added a thermal control system consisting of a Raspberry Pi Pico a handful of MOSFETs and a thermistor to sense the GPU’s temperature so the fans are only driven when the card is getting hot. The Pi Pico is of course way more powerful than needed for such a simple task but allowed [Devon] to program it in MicroPython using more advanced programming techniques than would be possible on say an Arduino.

We love the elegant design of the fan duct which enables two of these huge cards to fit onto a motherboard side-by-side. We’ve seen people working on the opposite problem of fitting large fans into small cases as well as designs that discard the whole idea of using fans for cooling.

These three could be among the fastest growers this decade.

As history clearly suggests the biggest gains in the stock market are made over the long term. The 3600% rise in the S&P 500 index over the last 40 years is evidence that time in the market is more important than timing the market.

But some innovative companies have crushed the performance of the broader indexes. Take Amazon for instance which has soared 191000% since its public listing in 1997. Given the rapid pace with which technology evolves the next Amazon-like opportunity could be right around the corner.

These Motley Fool contributors think Nvidia (NVDA 1.27%) Snowflake (SNOW 0.82%) and Palantir (PLTR -2.55%) could be the next tech disruptors to beat the market this decade (and beyond).

Graphics are the future of reality

Anthony Di Pizio (Nvidia): Semiconductors have become the most important component in modern manufacturing. They're the advanced computer chips that power digital consumer goods like smartphones gaming consoles and even cars. As products trend further toward digitization demand for these chips is soaring and Nvidia is a best-in-class producer.

The company is best known for its graphics cards which make it a key player in futuristic technologies like virtual reality augmented reality and even self-driving vehicles. But in the present Nvidia's graphics products are a red-hot favorite among consumers for PC gaming applications to the point where global supply is constantly running short. In fact the company sold over $3 billion worth of gaming-related graphics cards alone in the most recent fiscal second quarter 85% more than the same quarter last year.

On the whole assuming Nvidia's current price-to-sales ratio remains the same it needs to grow its revenue by 20% per year until 2030 for its stock to increase fivefold from here and therefore turn $200000 into $1 million. Right now it's crushing that growth rate.

Metric Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2022 (Estimate) CAGR Revenue $10.9 billion $25.7 billion 53%

But Nvidia is also highly profitable. It delivered a record high $6.90 in earnings per share in fiscal 2021 which represented 53% growth compared to fiscal 2020 and led the company to pay $395 million in dividends throughout the year. It's not often technology companies offer sound profitability to accompany their astronomical growth rates so Nvidia's investment case certainly stands out.

But it's the company's smallest segments -- professional visualization and automotive -- that could take over as the biggest drivers of growth over the long term. After all the future of technology looks set to be dominated by augmented realities and autonomous vehicles.

Snowflake: The epitome of neutrality

Jamie Louko (Snowflake): Finding disruptive companies that could provide immense returns over the next 10 years can be difficult but Snowflake -- a company that has been capitalizing on the enterprise's shift to the cloud for data storage -- could be the one. Snowflake is a data warehouse provider -- meaning that when enterprises collect data from their business operations and want to store it for usage at a later time they can go to Snowflake to store it.

Snowflake competes with Amazon's AWS Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud but Snowflake has a major competitive edge: neutrality. If a company has data stored on both AWS and Azure the company would have to go through both systems individually to receive its data to use it -- which is rather time-consuming -- and with it stored in two different areas it can be difficult to analyze it effectively. With Snowflake it would retrieve that data from either data warehouse for the customer and transform the data into an easily understandable format so it can be analyzed.

The company owns storage space on AWS and Azure so that companies can choose where they want data stored for the future. While this poses a risk to Snowflake -- by permanently giving money to its competition -- this is how the company remains the neutral party. This aspect of the business seems to be important to customers -- Snowflake has 116 customers spending over $1 million on the platform while it grew its second-quarter 2021 revenue by 103% year over year to $272 million. Its net retention rate sits high at 169% meaning that customers spend 69% more today than they did during the year-ago period.

Despite the company's operating loss of 58% of revenue it is valued at 110 times sales. The company is executing on all fronts however and its total addressable market is massive and growing: Snowflake expects companies' cloud spending to increase 235% to $356 billion annually by 2025. While its valuation is sky-high there is no doubt that this company will continue to capitalize on the blizzard of data being created while disrupting how it is stored.

Silicon Valley's most secretive start-up

Trevor Jennewine (Palantir Technologies): Modern enterprises create lots of data which is both good and bad. Data is knowledge and knowledge can be powerful. But extracting insights can be difficult because data is often spread across different applications and infrastructures. That's where Palantir can help.

The company -- named after an omniscient crystal ball from The Lord of the Rings -- provides analytics software that helps clients integrate and make sense of siloed data sets. In turn that empowers leaders and executives to make informed decisions and it enables data scientists to build powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models.

In 2003 Palantir got its start working with the U.S. intelligence community. The Pentagon and CIA deployed its Gotham software in Iraq and Afghanistan where it played a critical role in helping U.S. special forces detect roadside bombs and track terrorists (including Osama bin Laden). Since then Gotham has seen adoption by numerous other government agencies including the U.S. Army Air Force and Coast Guard.

To complement that product Palantir's Foundry platform offers similar functionality to commercial organizations and it has seen adoption across 40 different industries. For instance Foundry helps retailers forecast demand it helps manufacturers monitor supply chains and it empowers pharmaceutical companies to accelerate drug discovery. More importantly customers can access archetypes (i.e. workflow templates) that accelerate time to value for existing use cases. And as Foundry is adapted to novel use cases the number of available archetypes should grow.

Despite intense competition Palantir differentiates itself in two ways: First its past work with classified information underscores the security of its platform. Data privacy is an important issue and few (if any) other companies have been trusted with national secrets to same extent as Palantir. Likewise the company's third platform (Apollo) is a continuous delivery solution that keeps Gotham and Foundry up to date but it also allows those software-as-a-service (SaaS) products to run in atypical environments.

Specifically SaaS is typically deployed in public clouds but Palantir's SaaS runs in public clouds private data centers and even classified networks. In fact its platforms have been deployed in submarines aircraft and Humvees. Management believes that makes Palantir unique. Not surprisingly the company is growing at a steady clip.

Metric Q2 2020 (TTM) Q2 2021 (TTM) CAGR Customers 137 169 23% Revenue $901.1 million $1.3 billion 47%

I like Palantir's prospects for future growth. Management puts its market opportunity at $119 billion and the company recently won several big contracts including a deal with the U.S. Army worth $823 million.

More importantly as digital transformation drives the creation of ever-increasing troves of data organizations that hope to capitalize on that will need powerful analytics tools and Palantir fits that bill perfectly. That's why this stock could grow fivefold by 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnLzUtdGhpbmdzLWtub3ctYnV5aW5nLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Things You Have to Know Before Buying a Graphics Card,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnLzUtdGhpbmdzLWtub3ctYnV5aW5nLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8wNy9oMm8tYWktcmFpc2VzLTEwMG0tYXQtYS0xLTdiLXZhbHVhdGlvbi1mb3ItdG9vbHMtdG8tbWFrZS1haS11c2FibGUtYnktYW55LWtpbmQtb2YtZW50ZXJwcmlzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,H2O.ai raises $100M at a $1.6B pre-money valuation for tools to make AI usable by any kind of enterprise,"H2O.ai — a startup that has developed an open-source framework as well as proprietary apps that make it easier for any kind of enterprise to build and operate artificial intelligence-based services — has seen a surge of interest as AI applications have become more ubiquitous and enterprises beyond tech companies want to get in on the action. Now it has raised $100 million to fuel its growth a round of funding that values H2O.ai at $1.7 billion post-money ($1.6 billion pre-money).

This is a Series E round and it’s being led by a strategic backer the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) which has been a customer of the startup and will be using the backing to kick off a deeper partnership between the two to build new services. Others in the round include Goldman Sachs Pivot Investment Partners Crane Venture Partners and Celesta Capital. Further plans for the funding include building more products for H2O.ai as a whole and hiring more talent to continue expanding the company’s H2O AI Hybrid Cloud platform.

This is not the first time that a customer has led a round as a strategic backer: in 2019 Goldman Sachs led the company’s Series D of $72.5 million. As a sign of how the company has been growing and the general appetite for what it does H2O’s valuation has leapfrogged since that last round when it was valued at $400 million per PitchBook data. Mountain View-based H2O.ai has raised $246.5 million to date.

The fact that both of the last rounds have been led by big banks that are also customers of H2O.ai’s speaks a lot to where the opportunity has been for the startup. Sri Ambati the founder and CEO (who previously was also a co-founder of Platfora which was acquired by Workday) told me over email that about 40% of the company’s revenues currently come from the very wide and all-encompassing world of financial services.

“Retail banking credit cards payments — almost every payment system from PayPal to MasterCard are customers of H2O” he said. On the equities side companies power fixed income asset management and mortgage backed security services using H2O’s technology with MarketAxess Franklin Templeton and BNY Mellon also “strong” customers he said.

That is also seeing a growing complement of business from other verticals he added: Unilever Reckitt P&G are among those in consumer goods; UPS is one of its users in logistics and delivery; Chipotle is among those in food services; and he said that AT&T “is one of our largest customers.”

Covid-19 has had a role to play here too.

“Manufacturing became a fast-growing vertical due to supply chain disruption and demand sensing” he said of the pandemic. “We launched H2O AI Health to help our hospitals and providers payers like Aetna and pharma customers.”

Notably H2O.ai is also now breaking ground into working more with other tech companies that want to build more AI into their own workflows to in turn provide services to their own customers. “Our latest wins are in vertical clouds and SaaS ISVs” Ambati said.

The company has offered an open source component to its services which it calls simply H2O from its earliest days and that is now used by over 20000 enterprises. Part of the reason for that is its flexibility: H2O.ai says that its open source framework works both on top of existing big data infrastructure on bare metal or on top of existing Hadoop Spark or Kubernetes clusters and is able to ingest data directly from HDFS Spark S3 Azure Data Lake or any other data source into it’s in-memory distributed key-value store.

“Our open source platform gives freedom and ability for customers to build their own AI centers of competence and excellence” Ambati said of the open source tools. “We are like the Tenzing Sherpas of the AI mountains helping our customers to traverse and conquer AI peaks.”

That framework can be used by engineers to build customized applications while H2O.ai’s proprietary tools provide more completed applications in areas like fraud detection churn prediction anomaly detection price optimization and credit scoring — areas that can benefit from the ingestion of massive amounts of data in order to gain better insights into what might happen next: these sit either as a complement to what human analysts and data scientists might be able to unearth or potentially in some cases as a replacement for the more basic work they might do. In all there are currently some 45 applications in all.

The plan Ambati said is to over time build out more of these which will reside in “app stores” in specific verticals offering a range of its proprietary pre-built tools particular to the demands of each of them.

The trend fueling H2O.ai’s growth has been gaining momentum for several years now.

Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for the world of enterprise IT: used well tools like machine learning natural language processing and computer vision can speed up productivity or even open up completely new areas of opportunity for an organization. Over time it can save companies billions of dollars in operational and other costs.

One big issue however is that in many cases organizations might lack the internal teams to build or carry through projects that use AI and that’s before considering the fact that as needs and parameters evolve all of that infrastructure will need updating too. Technology touches everything in an enterprise these days but not every enterprise is a tech company.

H2O.ai is not the first or only startup that has aimed to fill this gap in the market although it seems to have managed its task a little more successfully than others.

Notably Element.AI out of Canada was built out on the back of a large amount of funding and buy-in from big tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia also to address the idea of democratizing AI for the wider world of enterprises that might lack the resources to build and run AI tools themselves but could very much benefit from them before their businesses simply get cannibalized by the many AI-fuelled tech companies moving into their spaces. It had a strong focus on integration (it was a little like an Accenture for AI services) but never managed to make a big enough jump from concept to business and was eventually acquired in 2020 by ServiceNow to complement its own efforts to build tools for businesses.

Ambati said that only about 10% of H2O.ai’s business is in the area of services with the remainder 90% coming from its products as an explanation for why one startup’s approach worked while another did not.

“It is easy to get lured by services in data science and AI” he said. “Being true to our product maker culture and yet building deep customer empathy and listening is critical to success. Customers experience our maker culture and become makers themselves. We are continuously making our software easier (democratizing) low-code reusable recipes and automation through AI Cloud and building data pipelines AI AppStores and delivering AI as a service that our customers can use to improve their customer experiences brands and communities.

“The big difference — we are raising a forest not just a tree. H2O AI Cloud H2O Wave our low-code Application Development H2O AI AppStores Marketplace and H2O-3 Open Source ML are at the core of AI Applications and software already and we are partnering with customers and their ecosystem of partners and developers.”

That’s a play and business resonating well with investors too

“Commonwealth Bank has a significant asset in the millions of data points collected every day. AI already has helped us to improve our customer experience however we know there is untapped potential to do more” said Matt Comyn CEO of CBA in a statement. “The investment in and strategic partnership with H2O.ai extends our leadership in artificial intelligence and ultimately boosts the bank’s ability to offer leading digital propositions and reimagined products and services to customers.” Dr. Andrew McMullan chief data and analytics officer at CBA will join the H2O.ai board."

NORFOLK Va. – According to the Colonial Athletic Association football media guide Villanova Towson New Hampshire and Richmond all shared the 2012 league championship with 6-2 league records.



Yet anyone who follows Old Dominion football knows that had the championship been determined on the field where it should have been the Monarchs would have won the title.



Because ODU had announced it was leaving the CAA to join Conference USA in 2013 to move up to the Football Bowl Subdivision the league declared the Monarchs ineligible for team titles in all sports.



The Monarchs won the mythical football title defeating James Madison 38-28 in their final CAA game to finish 7-1 in the league on a team that would go 11-2 and finish sixth in the nation.



Yet you don't see a CAA championship trophy in ODU's L.R. Hill Sports Complex.



No other conference in the country has a similar policy. Even if you plan to move to another league your teams are eligible for championships in every other Division I league.



What the CAA did was unfair to ODU but most of all unfair to the coaches and athletes who bore the brunt of the punishment meted out.



Now nine years later the CAA has brought the hammer down on JMU.



JMU was a founding member of the CAA in 1985 and has been a valued member in the 36 years since. In fact no one school has done more to burnish the CAA's reputation than JMU.



Times change over 36 years and JMU has outgrown the CAA.



JMU is a growing school with nearly 22000 students and an elite Football Championship Subdivision program. JMU fans students and alumni have long been clamoring to move up to FBS and the Dukes have the facilities fan base and budget to be successful.



JMU wisely took advantage of the current round of conference realignment to join the Sun Belt Conference where the Dukes will be reunited with ODU with whom it carried on a brief but torrid football rivalry and old FCS rival Appalachian State.



ODU President Brian O. Hemphill Ph.D. spoke on JMU's behalf Friday at a state hearing in which officials approved the school's request to move up.



JMU will join ODU Virginia Virginia Tech and Liberty as in-state FBS programs and will open the way for JMU to begin scheduling home games against Power 5 schools.



But even before JMU had received state permission the CAA declared the Dukes ineligible for league championships.



The CAA has an antiquated bylaw that allows the league to declare schools ineligible for championships if they announce their intention to leave the league.



JMU pleaded with league presidents to make an exception and media reports indicate it was almost unanimously rejected.



JMU Athletic Director Jeff Bourne and President Johnathan R. Alger co-authored the appeal. Bourne speaking during a press conference Saturday to announce JMU's move to the Sun Belt said ""I thought we did a really good job of trying to explain the scenario relative to the bylaw.""



The results were immediate and heartbreaking.



JMU was scheduled to host the CAA Men's Soccer Tournament next week but now won't. JMU's volleyball team is tied for the league lead but is out of the CAA tournament and thus has no realistic postseason hopes.



The same is true for men's and women's basketball who will play this season knowing they almost surely won't go to the NCAA Tournament.



Even JMU's softball team the feel-good story of last spring's World Series must hope for an at-large bid to return to the NCAA Tournament.



The CAA is being roasted by the national media and deservedly so. All this does is hurt students and coaches not the decision makers.



It was worse than tone deaf. Given what we've all been through the last through years it was cruel.



Every college athlete lived through the pandemic in 2019 and 2020. Do I need to remind you what a nightmare it was.



In order to play last spring athletes around the country lived in ""bubbles"" meaning they associated only with their teammates and coaches. They gave up their social lives and basically spent their days huddled up in their homes.



And this was months after campuses were closed and students were forced to take classes online. The country virtually shut down and so many people lost their businesses and many thousands lost their lives.



Understandably many students including athletes were traumatized.



Many athletes have needed mental health counseling and for all of them the joy of competing in 2021-22 was something they cherished more than ever.



How hundreds of JMU athletes have seen those dreams shattered.



""Their lives are centered around fighting for championships"" Bourne said. ""And who we've hurt through this is not the institution as much as the student-athletes.""



I could hardly bear to watch JMU coaches being interviewed on TV because of the pain they are going through. Just imagine how the athletes are coping.



An excerpt of a statement released by JMU says things pretty clearly:



""In an era when the industry of college athletics stresses student-athlete welfare this decision is completely contrary to those ideals. We were thorough and heartfelt in appealing to the league's council of presidents but that appeal was denied. Eight other Division I conferences have full members that have publicly announced an exit and yet all eight have allowed the student-athletes at those institutions to continue competing for championships.""



College athletics has rightfully moved toward a more caring model over the last decade for athletes. More academic advising. Limits on practice in-season and out of season. A greater emphasis on mental health. Payments to many athletes to compensate for the full cost of attendance.



I see the results of these efforts every day at ODU. The academic performance of athletes at ODU far exceeds that of the general student population in spite of all the work that goes into being an athlete.



ODU raised money in 2012 to buy its football players CAA championship rings and declared themselves CAA champions. They weren't of course and unspoken among all the bravado is that they know other teams got trophies and they didn't.



The ODU men's soccer team was so good it won an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.



But the same wasn't true for so many other teams including women's soccer baseball golf and tennis which were unable to compete for team titles.



The pain and hard feelings from nine years ago still resonate.



ODU's 2013 baseball team won 32 games and nine of its last 12 but after winning their final game at Wofford 8-1 the Monarchs simply packed up and went home.



""The people I felt worse for were the seniors"" ODU baseball coach Chris Finwood said. ""We had a pretty good ballclub. We Had a pretty good chance of winning the CAA tournament.



""We did the best we could. We finished out the season. It was just a tough way to end things.""



As for JMU Finwod said ""I feel bad for those kids having to go through that.



""It's a shame that they're being so punitive. What is there to gain?""



CAA officials say they don't want their league to be represented in the NCAA tournament by a team from a university that's leaving.



So why isn't that an issue for Conference USA the Atlantic Sun and so many other leagues?



Bourne drew a loud ovation Saturday morning when he said he will continue to press CAA officials to reverse their decision.



""Our goal right now is to fight for our student-athletes our kids and our coaches"" he said.



I hope CAA presidents are paying attention to the uproar and the pain they've caused and realize they made a terrible mistake. Reversing course is the right thing to do.

Old Dominion (3-6 2-3) outplayed FIU (1-8 0-5) from the start sending the Panthers to 1-8 with a 47-24 victory. Three of the six losses for Ricky Rahne’s club had come by one score or less unlike the 22-point average margin of defeat for FIU in its seven defeats prior.

“There’s things that we do well at times and one of the things I have an appreciation for is they have guts and haven’t quit” said FIU head coach Butch Davis. “The issues that we have there’s no fix for we’re playing 15-18 kids who shouldn’t even be suiting up.”

After the Panthers' first drive ended in a punt Monarchs’ quarterback Hayden Wolff quickly drove his team 62 yards in five plays ending in a 20-yard touchdown strike to tight end Zack Kuntz. For Wolff the contest served as a homecoming for the Venice Florida native who made his first career start against the Panthers in November of 2019 at then-Riccardo Silva Stadium. On FIU’s second drive of the game the familiar culprit of self-inflicted errors reared their head as tight end Rivaldo Fairweather took a tight end screen for a first down — but after review it was ruled that he fumbled at the conclusion of the play giving ODU the ball back at the FIU 31-yard line. Three plays later Old Dominion kicker Nick Rice would connect on a career-long 50-yard field goal to extend the lead to 10.

Panther quarterback Max Bortenschlager has struggled to find consistency with his receivers throughout the season despite ranking third in C-USA averaging over 276 passing yards per game. It would again be a boom or bust type of performance for the FIU passing game as they were called upon early to try and cut another first-half deficit. They found the scoreboard when Bortenschlager hit Tyrese Chambers down the left sideline taking advantage of a fallen ODU defensive back. Chambers’ eight touchdown of the season would go 46 yards cutting the Monarchs’ lead to three.

Bortenschlager had been sacked 21 times entering the contest as FIU ranks second-to-last in C-USA in sacks allowed. ODU managed to sack FIU’s starter five times on the evening.

FIU’s inability to stop the run was on full display in the loss starting with Elijah Davis’ 61-yard TD scamper on a play that saw him run virtually untouched. The redshirt sophomore would finish the day with a career-high 114 yards. The next miscue for the Panthers would help aid ODU’s next offensive drive. On the kickoff following a Chase Gabriel field goal — a drive that saw FIU settle for three after making it to ODU four-yard line — reserve linebacker Chance Coleman was hit with a 15-yard face mask giving the Monarchs the ball at their 49-yard line. They would ride Wolff’s right arm down the field as he accounted for 40 of the 51 yards on the drive that ended with running back Blake Watson scoring from three yards out to make it 24-10.

He also crossed the 100-yard mark on the day rushing for 158 yards on 26 carries — his fourth straight 100-yard day.

“The biggest thing is the number of defensive linemen that we’re missing” said Davis. “Hal Vinson is gone Tevin Jones is gone it makes it very difficult when you’re trying to stop the run because the number of bodies isn’t there.”

The Panthers’ run game was effective but after falling down early the team was forced to abandon the ground attack. As a whole the team finished with 107 yards with D’Vonte Price having 45 yards on 10 carries before exiting with a lower-body injury shortly before halftime.

“If we truly needed him we believe he could have played but we have to take care of him” said Davis.

The FIU defense would force two turnovers in the second quarter desperately trying to keep the game in reach. Walk-on quarterback-turned-safety Gio Richardson picked off an errant Wolff pass recording his first career interception followed by Jeramy Passmore’s fumble recovery as the defense was backed up on its two-yard line. Postgame Davis spoke about how many walk-ons are seeing time this year.

“We have over 30 walk-ons on our roster and over half of them are playing” said Davis. “In a normal season there’s 85 scholarship guys and we’re down to 54 the number of players missing is that drastic.”

Despite the extra chances FIU wouldn’t be able to produce any more points and ODU took a 24-10 lead into the half.

The Monarchs’ extended the lead to 30-10 early in the third quarter as Wolff found wideout Darius Savedge down the middle of the field for a 63-yard score. Wolff finished the evening 22-of-42 passing for 283 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.

Redshirt junior Bryce Singleton would score FIU’s first touchdown of the second half on a 65-yard touchdown pass from Bortenschlager his first of two on the evening. Singleton finished with a career-high 199 yards on six catches. The 199 yards was the third-highest mark in program history in a game.

Following Rice’s second field goal of the night to put ODU ahead 40-17 Davis inserted true freshman Grayson James at the midway point of the fourth quarter. The appearance was the fifth for James meaning he’s no longer eligible for the four-game redshirt rule.

“We prepare him every single week like a backup quarterback in the event he’s called on and college defenses are significantly more complicated than anything he’s seen in high school” said Davis. “But he’s getting better and he was able to drive the offense down the field and produce a score which was good for him.”

For Rahne and the Monarchs the three wins are their most since 2018’s four-win campaign a clear signal that the first-year head coach has the rebuild in Norfolk trending upward. For FIU they’ll look towards Middle Tennesee to try and get their first FBS victory in over 700 days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmptdS5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExLzA1LXN1bmJlbHQtYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50LnNodG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Madison joins Sun Belt Conference - JMU,"The Sun Belt Conference announced Saturday the addition of James Madison University into the league after a unanimous vote of the Sun Belt CEOs. JMU will join the Sun Belt Conference no later than July 1 2023.

A press conference is set for this morning (Saturday Nov 6) at 10 a.m. ET/ 9 a.m. CT at the Atlantic Union Bank Center on the JMU campus and is open to the public.

“We are thrilled to welcome James Madison University to the Sun Belt Conference” said Keith Gill Sun Belt Conference Commissioner. “This move brings another strong brand and passionate fanbase into the Sun Belt and elevates the Dukes’ storied football program to the highest level of NCAA competition. I am grateful to JMU President Jonathan Alger and Athletics Director Jeff Bourne for their leadership during this process and look forward to working closely with them moving forward.”

The addition of JMU will bring the number of Sun Belt members to 16 with the Dukes joining current members—App State Little Rock Arkansas State Coastal Carolina Georgia Southern Georgia State Louisiana ULM South Alabama UTA Texas State and Troy—and new additions Southern Miss Old Dominion and Marshall which were welcomed to the Sun Belt Conference last week.

“Since July our presidents and chancellors have expressed confidence in Sun Belt leadership and our member configuration amid national realignment conversations” said Dr. Kelly Damphousse Arkansas State Chancellor & Chair of the Sun Belt Executive Committee. “The recent additions of Marshall Southern Miss and Old Dominion to the SBC aligned perfectly with our strategic goal of only adding schools that improved our conference’s competitiveness. As I shared with President Alger and AD Bourne the Sun Belt CEOs believe that JMU likewise mirrors our conference’s athletics and academic missions while also capitalizing on regionality goals. I was very impressed with JMU’s beautiful campus and by their FBS-level facility investment during our visit. My colleagues and I look forward to welcoming the Dukes to the Sun Belt Conference!”

James Madison University founded in 1908 and located in Harrisonburg Virginia supports a student population of over 22000. Athletically the program claims four NCAA national championships—two in FCS football in 2004 and 2016 one in field hockey in 1994 and one in women’s lacrosse in 2018. The football program has appeared in the FCS playoffs on 17 occasions including each of the past seven seasons.

The Dukes will aim to follow the path forged by a number of current Sun Belt members—most recently App State Georgia Southern and Coastal Carolina—that have found success at the FBS level after transitioning from the FCS ranks. The Mountaineers have won six-straight bowl games from 2015-2020 the Eagles have been to four bowl games over the past six seasons and the Chanticleers have been ranked in the national polls for 21 straight weeks.

In the last decade the Dukes have built one of the strongest mid-major athletics departments in the country. In addition to the success in football the last six years have seen JMU win the 2018 NCAA Championship in women’s lacrosse reach the semifinals of the 2021 Women’s College World Series and the 2018 national quarterfinals in men’s soccer.

JMU has continued to build its national profile finishing inside the top 100 of the Learfield Directors’ Cup each of the last six seasons culminating at No. 67 in the country in 2020-21. All told the Dukes have racked up 28 conference titles across 11 different sports since 2015.

“As James Madison University prepares and anticipates to earn additional national recognition for our academic programs and excellence admission into the Sun Belt Conference is a natural and complementary next step for our institution” said JMU President Jonathan Alger. “We are thrilled to have received and accepted an invitation into this conference with a new and visionary opportunity for high-level competition within the eastern region. We have always sought to do things the right way as a university for our students faculty and staff student-athletes and coaches and the time is right for JMU to move up to the highest level in D-1 athletics and enter the Sun Belt! This is an exciting and historic moment of transition for JMU and I greatly appreciate the teamwork and diligence of so many people behind the scenes that have enabled us to reach this important milestone.”

The Dukes sponsor 18 varsity sports. Men’s sports include baseball basketball football golf soccer and tennis. Women’s sports include basketball cross country field hockey golf indoor track & field lacrosse outdoor track & field soccer softball swimming & diving tennis and volleyball.

“The Sun Belt Conference presents the right opportunity at the right time for James Madison Athletics” JMU Athletics Director Jeff Bourne said. “Our department has achieved at a tremendously high level over the last seven years and even further throughout our entire history. We have demonstrated an increased ability to succeed at the national level and this move to the Sun Belt further enhances that to an even greater degree as we move forward. JMU is committed to providing the best student-athlete experience in the nation and this move ensures that our focus resides on our student-athletes and balancing their competitive and off-the-field success.”

XPO Logistics (XPO 1.26%) delivered market-beating results in its first quarter since spinning out its logistics operations as an independent company but the stock sold off over issues in XPO's trucking business.

The issues a rare mishap for a company with a reputation as a top operator were significant and it will likely take a few quarters to resolve.

But for investors willing to take a long-term approach there was a lot of reason for optimism contained in the report. Here's why XPO is still a solid investment today even after the post-earnings market sell-off.

Trucking hits the brakes

XPO reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.94 per share on sales of $3.27 billion beating the consensus estimate for $0.93 per share in earnings on revenue of $3.1 billion. But the company's less-than-truckload (LTL) operation which ships freight from multiple customers in a single load ran into trouble posting an operating ratio of 84.4%.

That operating ratio -- a measure of operating expenses over net sales -- was up 190 basis points year over year attributed to issues including equipment shortages and labor challenges. XPO's problems stood out in part because many of its LTL rivals companies including Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL 1.03%) and Yellow (YELL -2.58%) posted strong results.

XPO CEO Brad Jacobs on a post-earnings call with investors admitted ""it obviously was not our finest hour"" in terms of LTL results but said ""we have our arms around the issue and we're dealing with it with great urgency.""

XPO detailed a plan to improve its LTL operation in the quarters to come including freight embargoes pulling an annual rate increase from January to November to account for higher costs opening new terminals and expanding capacity in existing ones and investing to expand its driver pool.

But the adjustments will take time -- only about half of the warehouse expansion is expected in 2022 for example -- and the markets clearly expect the issues to linger into the current quarter if not longer. XPO post-earnings tightened its full-year earnings view to $4.15 to $4.25 per share which even at the high end is about 15 cents short of consensus expectations.

The quarter wasn't all bad

For all the drama in LTL it is worth reminding that XPO was able to surpass expectations in terms of earnings per share and revenue. The company's other businesses and in particular its truck brokerage operation generated strong results that helped to offset LTL's issues. The brokerage business grew loads by 37% and net revenue was up 60% year over year. XPO's top 20 customers in the brokerage business increased their total volumes by 45% a sign that the company is taking share.

At least some of that is thanks to the company's investments in technology. Its XPO Connect product which matches shippers with available transportation saw cumulative downloads roughly triple year over year to 550000. Year over year carrier usage of XPO Connect more than doubled and the company said that 77% of carriers who use the Connect platform use it again over the following 30 days.

The brokerage business like many parts of the transportation industry is driven by scale and XPO Connect's success speaks well of the company's effort to build relationships with its top customers.

Overall XPO reported strong pricing and indicated it expects that pricing power to continue into the new year. Yields excluding fuel rose 6% year over year and price increases on contract renewals were up 8%. The company also paid down about $1.5 billion in debt during the quarter accelerating its push toward an investment grade debt rating.

There might be further opportunities to decrease leverage up ahead. Jacobs built his reputation in part on M&A and with demand for trucking assets strong in the current market XPO might look to shop some of its smaller units as a quick way to raise cash.

Tough quarter; still a great company

Summarizing the quarter Jacobs on the call said ""Even great companies stumble now and then and we certainly did not stumble companywide."" But the stumble in LTL is what caught investors off guard and it is now up to Jacobs and his management team to show they have their arms around the problem as soon as possible.

XPO has earned a strong reputation as an operator under Jacobs with the stock up more than 1400% during a 10-year period leading up to the August spinoff of GXO Logistics (GXO 0.15%). GXO has gotten most of the attention post-split but XPO still has the potential to be a best-in-class trucking and brokerage operation that can generate pricing power and strong returns thanks to its scale and its investments in technology.

It is understandable the market sold off based on the LTL performance but investors have done well by sticking with Jacobs and XPO over the long haul. These problems look fixable and XPO's brokerage business and its European operations are set up well to deliver.

Even after the sell-off investors would be wise to keep on trucking with XPO."

Gov. Greg Abbott has created a semiconductor task force that will work to attract semiconductor investment into the state including two key institutes being created by the federal government.

The Texas task force will bring together semiconductor industry stakeholders from the private sector higher education institutes and community partners to develop a proposal for the U.S Department of Commerce to choose Texas as the site for both the National Semiconductor Technology Center and the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program.

""With Texas at the helm of this initiative our growing tech community world-class research institutions and emphasis on innovation through collaboration will surely keep the nation on the cutting-edge of advancements in this sector. Texas offers the foundation necessary to fully address the country's commercial and defense needs in the semiconductor arena"" Abbott said in a written statement.

The task force was established as a global shortage of semiconductors the computer chips that operate everything from your laptop to your car continues. It also comes as U.S. lawmakers work to pass legislation that could encourage investment in semiconductor infrastructure.

Sen. John Cornyn R-Texas is one of the authors the CHIPS for America Act a bipartisan tech and manufacturing bill designed to expand domestic technology manufacturing and boost the country's ability to compete with China. The U.S. Senate passed the bill in January with additional legislation passed in June to fund it.

Among other things it calls for $52 billion to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The act could spark unprecedented investment from semiconductor companies establishing new fabs and making other investments in the United States including in Texas.

The National Semiconductor Technology Center is expected to be a public-private partnership that would create a lab to conduct research and create prototypes of advanced semiconductors in partnership. The National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program is expected to be a center for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Both programs were established by the CHIPS for America ACT which was passed earlier this year. The search for a home for the programs is still underway.

Abbott said Texas's industry leadership and innovation in the semiconductor sector makes the state the ideal location for both institutes.

""This initiative is critical for reinforcing the domestic semiconductor supply chain and is essential to our national security"" Abbott said in a written statement. ""In 2021 Texas was ranked No. 1 in the country for its leadership in semiconductors and we continue to see significant capital investment in areas across the state.""

Both Austin and Texas already have a significant semiconductor manufacturing presence and Texas is the nation's top exporter of semiconductors and other electronic components.

More than 200 semiconductor manufacturing facilities call Texas home and the state has seen a nearly 35% increase in these facilities since 2015 according to Abbott's office. Texas also is No.2 in the nation for employment in semiconductor and machinery manufacturing employing over 29000 Texans.

In Central Texas about a quarter of all manufacturing output in the region comes from semiconductor companies according to the Austin Regional Manufacturers Association. Semiconductor computer and related manufacturers employ 20820 people in the region according to the industry group.

Ed Latson executive director of the Austin Regional Manufacturers Association which is part of the new task force said the variety of partners on the initiative will help Texas present a unified and as it pursues these investments from the federal government.

""It's an impressive group of smart people representing prestigious organizations. And we all believe that Texas is the ideal location to maximize the federal investment"" Latson said.

Latson said landing the institutes would help ensure Texas and the U.S remain global technology supply leaders.

""This is an important opportunity. There is consensus that the United States needs to remain at the forefront of innovation and capability in semiconductors"" Latson said. ""These two institutes that the task force will pursue are ideally suited to be located in Texas and they will have a significant impact at keeping us on the leading edge of technology as well as less dependent on foreign suppliers.

The creation of the task force also comes as technology giant Samsung says it is considering two Central Texas locations as potential sites for a $17 billion chip-making facility. Samsung has said sites in Austin and Taylor are in the running for along with sites in Arizona and New York. The new fabrication facility is expected to be the most advanced to date for Samsung which is one of the world's largest makers of memory chips and smartphones.

But when you have a multi-billion dollar auto conglomerate endlessly waiting for news of some relief from the global chip shortage any encouraging statistics are well welcome. That's the situation the Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover finds themselves in.

EV

First reported by the Economic Times JLR released a series of press briefings throughout the first week of November 2021 detailing in-house research indicating that although we're still very much in the thick of the shortage the end of the tunnel might soon have a concrete end date.It's traditional for automakers to announce detailed reports of fiscal health statuses as well as the total number of vehicles sold while doing their best to predict the path ahead. Of course JLR doesn't pay a team of psychics to come up with these reports but knowledgeable consultants who take measure metrics imaginable to try and paint a picture to the best of their ability.Big names like GM Ford  VW Skoda  Renault and many others have all made cutbacks to staffing and production at the hand of the microchip menace. Sending staff home and leaving robots to run idle as the world scrambles to find any lasting solution.""Looking ahead the supply shortage of semiconductors remains dynamic and difficult to forecast. However JLR expects to see a gradual recovery starting in the second half of Fiscal 2022"" the Economic Times reports quotes in JLR's recent report regarding the three and six-month period ended September 2021.With JLR very much focused on the all-electric future the world seems to have promised for us. Models like the I-Paceand upcoming Range Rover plug-in Hybrid will likely ensure JLR doesn't feel left behind in a profound shift in automotive technology. If JLR's latest predictions come to pass they'll be in a great position compared to its rivals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExLzA3L2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy9zb3V0aC1rb3JlYS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWRhdGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Korea tech firms to provide U.S. with semiconductor data,"South Korea said its technology firms will provide some semiconductor data to the U.S. following a request by the Commerce Department for companies in the supply chain to provide information on inventory and sales of chips.

South Korean firms are preparing for a ""voluntary submission” of relevant information the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Sunday adding that its tech giants have been negotiating with the U.S. on the extent of data to be submitted. It didn’t elaborate.

The U.S. Commerce Department in September asked companies in the semiconductor supply chain to fill out questionnaires by Nov. 8 seeking information pertaining to the ongoing chip shortage. While the request is voluntary Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo warned industry representatives that the White House might invoke the Defense Production Act or other tools to force their hands if they don’t respond."

In June BleepingComputer reported that Ukrainian law enforcement arrested members of the Clop ransomware gang involved in laundering ransom payments.

This Friday new information came to light regarding how the operation was conducted and the law enforcement agencies involved.

Interpol's Operation Cyclone

The transcontinental operation named 'Operation Cyclone' was coordinated from INTERPOL's Cyber Fusion Centre in Singapore with assistance from Ukrainian and US law enforcement authorities.

This operation targeted Clop for its numerous attacks against Korean companies and US academic institutions where the threat actors encrypted devices and extorted organizations to pay a ransom or have their stolen data leaked.

In December 2020 Clop conducted a massive ransomware attack against E-Land Retail a South Korean conglomerate and retail giant causing 23 out of 50 NC Department Store and NewCore Outlet retail stores to temporarily close. They later claimed to have stolen 2000000 credit cards from the company using point-of-sale malware.

More recently Clop used a vulnerability in the Accellion secure file transfer gateway to steal confidential and private files of corporations and universities. When $10 million+ ransom demands were not paid the threat actors publicly released students' personal information from numerous universities and colleges.

Clop ransom note used in Accellion extortion demands

The US education institutions targeted in the Accellion attacks included the University of Colorado University of Miami Stanford Medicine University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) and the University of California.

Through intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies and private partners Operation Cyclone led to the arrest of six suspects in Ukraine the search of more than 20 houses businesses and vehicles and the seizure of computers and $185000 in cash assets.

The operation was also assisted by private partners including Trend Micro CDI Kaspersky Lab Palo Alto Networks Fortinet and Group-IB.

“Despite spiralling global ransomware attacks this police-private sector coalition saw one of global law enforcement’s first online criminal gang arrests which sends a powerful message to ransomware criminals that no matter where they hide in cyberspace we will pursue them relentlessly” said INTERPOL’s Director of Cybercrime Craig Jones in an announcement.

US cybersecurity firm Intel 471 previously told BleepingComputer that while the arrested members are linked to the Clop ransomware gang they were primarily involved in the money laundering for the criminal organization. The intelligence firm further said that core members of the Clop operation are likely out of harm's way in Russia.

If convicted the six suspected Clop members face up to eight years in prison.

A video released by Ukraine's SSU shows investigators conducting raids on the suspect's property and the seizure of evidence.

Targeting ransomware operations

With ransomware attacks escalating against critical infrastructure healthcare businesses and educational institutions law enforcement has been applying significant pressure on criminal operations this year.

This law enforcement activity has led to numerous arrests and infrastructure takedowns including:

Law enforcement operations have also led to ransomware gang's shutting down their operations as they feel law enforcement tightening on their activities.

This includes the recent shutdown of the REvil and BlackMatter operations as well as Avaddon ransomware's shutdown in June.

While ransomware gangs may shut down their operations it does not mean that law enforcement has given up on bringing them to justice.

This week the US Department of State announced a $10 million reward for identifying or locating key leaders in the DarkSide/BlackMatter ransomware operation.

Regarding the Red Notices these are requests to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition surrender or similar legal action.

According to Interpol two Red Notices were sent to 194 Interpol member countries following a request from Korea’s cybercrime investigation division. The notices follow the Ukraine arrest of six members of a notorious ransomware family during a global operation coordinated by Interpol with Korean Ukrainian and US law enforcement authorities in June.

The global strike – codenamed Operation Cyclone – follows global police investigations into attacks against Korean companies and US academic institutions by the Cl0p ransomware threat group.

Cl0p malware operators in Ukraine allegedly attacked private and business targets in Korea and the US by blocking access to their computer files and networks and then demanded extortionate ransoms for restoring access.

The suspects are thought to have facilitated the transfer and cash-out of assets on behalf of the ransomware group whilst also threatening to make sensitive data public if additional payments were not made.

Intelligence-led operation

According to Interpol Operation Cyclone was coordinated from INTERPOL’s Cyber Fusion Centre in Singapore.

The resulting intelligence enabled Ukrainian police to search more than 20 houses businesses and vehicles confiscate property and computers and seize USD 185000 in cash assets as well as to make the six arrests.

Some of the cash confiscated by Interpol

“Despite spiralling global ransomware attacks this police-private sector coalition saw one of global law enforcement’s first online criminal gang arrests which sends a powerful message to ransomware criminals that no matter where they hide in cyberspace we will pursue them relentlessly” said Interpol’s Director of Cybercrime Craig Jones.

Interpol said it deployed Operation Cyclone with the assistance of information provided by its private partners Trend Micro CDI Kaspersky Lab Palo Alto Networks Fortinet and Group-IB through INTERPOL’s Gateway project.

According to Interpol two Korea-based cyber threat companies – S2W LAB and KFSI – also provided Interpol with valuable dark web data analysis throughout the operation.

Interpol said that Operation Cyclone continues to supply evidence that is feeding into further cybercrime investigations and enabling the international police community to disrupt numerous channels used by cybercriminals to launder cryptocurrency.

Significant security threat

According to Interpol the six suspects are believed to be tightly linked to a Russian-language cybercriminal gang known for naming-and-shaming its victims on a Tor leak site and for moving more than USD 500 million in funds linked to multiple ransomware activities.

Interpol said that the attacks target key infrastructure such as transportation and logistics education manufacturing energy financial aerospace telecommunications healthcare and high-tech sectors worldwide.

If convicted the six suspects face up to eight years in prison.",,,,,,,,,

Paths of Glory

TCM 6:15pm

Catch a Classic!

Cowritten and directed by visionary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick this searing 1957 drama is among the most powerful antiwar films ever made — with its anti-military stance so profound and radical for its time that the movie was banned in France for nearly 20 years and banned on U.S. military bases in Europe. Based on the novel by Humphrey Cobb Paths of Glory tells the story of shell-shocked French World War I soldiers ordered on a suicide mission reluctantly led by Col. Dax (a fiery Kirk Douglas). When Dax refuses the corrupt Gen. Mireau’s (George Macready) orders for soldiers to fire on their own ranks to keep them driving forward during this impossible mission the general scapegoats a group of the soldiers to protect his promotion accusing them of cowardice in a kangaroo court. This haunting exquisitely photographed dissection of the military machine in all its absurdity and capacity for dehumanization (a theme Kubrick would continue to explore throughout his career) is mesmerizing from its tense trench warfare sequences to its gripping courtroom climax to its ravaging final scene.

In order they are: the 1939 crime film They All Come Out Tourneur’s American feature directorial debut; Cat People (1942) the first of Tourneur’s memorable collaborations with producer Val Lewton on classic — and classy — low-budget horror productions; I Walked With a Zombie (1943) another Lewton-produced creepfest; the 1944 Gregory Peck-led war film Days of Glory; the Oscar-nominated melodrama Experiment Perilous (1944) starring Hedy Lamarr and George Brent; Out of the Past the legendary 1947 noir starring Robert Mitchum Jane Greer and Kirk Douglas; Berlin Express (1948) an early Cold War thriller starring Robert Ryan and Merle Oberon; Easy Living a 1949 drama with Victor Mature and Lucille Ball; and Wichita (1955) the only color film from Tourneur on today’s lineup a grand CinemaScope Western starring Joel McCrea as Wyatt Earp. — Jeff Pfeiffer

There’s no one you trust more than family. When a former gang member puts out a hit on Detective Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg) the cop’s dad police commissioner Frank (Tom Selleck) assigns his younger son Sgt. Jamie (Will Estes) to protection duty. “As you can imagine it goes over like a lead balloon with Danny that Jamie’s going to be his ‘handler’” Estes says. “Danny doesn’t take orders so well and Jamie is just trying to make the best of it.” Then little bro rolls out his sleeping bag next to the star detective’s bed! Sibling bickering aside though “there is real danger.” Jamie has his hands full in this episode: Wife Eddie (Vanessa Ray) meets her new NYPD partner Luis Badillo (Ian Quinlan) whom he recommended. “He thought they would complement each other” Estes adds “but they’re like oil and water. Later that will come to a head.” (The scene you won’t see? After Jamie breaks up a fight between Eddie and the handsome Badillo Estes says “I ad-libbed ‘This tension better not be sexual!’”) The actor is “really enjoying [playing a] leadership role” in both scenarios he adds. Good practice for an — inevitable? — promotion to lieutenant. We also see Frank’s long-secret grandson Joe Hill (Will Hochman) for the first time since last season’s finale. Some trivia: When Hochman guest-stars Estes becomes “Jamie” off-camera too to avoid having two Wills on set.

The French Connection 50th Anniversary (Directed by William Friedkin)

TCM beginning at 8pm

Catch a Classic!

Five Oscars including Best Picture went to Best Director Oscar winner William Friedkin’s highly acclaimed and realistic 1971 crime drama The French Connection which is based on the true story of New York City narcotics detective Eddie Egan dramatized here as Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle (portrayed by Best Actor Oscar winner Gene Hackman). The adapted screenplay by Ernest Tidyman which also won an Oscar sparkles under Friedkin’s direction as it follows Doyle and fellow detective Buddy “Cloudy” Russo (Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee Roy Scheider) as they use sharp instincts and unconventional methods to thwart the international suppliers of New York’s heroin trade. The film’s cinematography and sound were also nominated for Oscars and their excellence is particularly on display during the movie’s legendary car chase often cited as one of the greatest ever filmed with Doyle commandeering a civilian’s car for a frantic pursuit of an elevated train on which a hitman is trying to escape and creative camerawork enhancing the thrills and sensation of speeding through the streets of a densely crowded big-city borough. The French Connection celebrated the 50th anniversary of its release on Oct. 7 so it’s a perfect time to revisit or discover the influential classic. It’s also perfect time to check out another Friedkin crime-drama classic 1985’s To Live and Die in L.A. which he cowrote as well as directed and which airs as the second half of tonight’s double feature. The neo-noir thriller is led by William Petersen in his second feature-film role as a secret service agent who with his partner (John Pankow) goes to increasingly desperate lengths to arrest a counterfeiter (Willem Dafoe in one of his earlier credited roles and playing one of his creepier characters — which is saying something). To Live and Die in L.A. features another harrowing and highly regarded Friedkin-directed car chase this time with the participants careening the wrong way down a busy Los Angeles freeway. — Jeff Pfeiffer

Leonardo Da Vinci Airport in Fiumicino witnessed a historic event as PM Narendra Modi stepped out from Airforce One to meet Supreme Pontiff His Holiness Pope Francis. This much-anticipated meet will mark a new beginning and end simultaneously as It is only after 12 years that Democratically elected representative of billion plus people will converge the spiritual beacon of Christianity. This almost covers half the strength of contemporary humanity and thus its impact can definitely permeate caste gender religion or even national boundaries to reach the last man on the ladder encompassing whole humanity in the process. This meeting of minds can reinvigorate the spirit and value of mutuality humanity compassion which is the need of the hour as the wounds of the many crises tragedies throughout the world are still not healed properly. We not only have to fight these tragedies but the hate in people’s hearts is influenced by factors not in their control. As a Citizen of the Democratic Republic of India and a Christian I feel that the same spirit of compassion is represented by our PM Narendra Modi which through this meet with His Holiness will illuminate the world with shared initiatives that concerns our present and future from the current global pandemic to climate change. This meet symbolizes a peaceful synchronization of the Indian Spirit. “The world is a family” and Christian spirit represented in 1 John 4:8- Anyone who does not love does not know God because God is love. The word Pontiff which is used to address His Highness itself means “the builder of bridges” so this remarkable event has kindled a ray of hope in the hearts of too many people to count.

The current period of time was a period of chaos tragedy as the impact of COVID-19 is felt by the whole of humanity very personally but it also highlighted the inherent cleavage or divide among people already divided by caste race religion or country. Very few people dared to cross this divide and among them I can say with pride that PM Modi not only worked day and night to combat this pandemic on a National level but he did not hesitate to help people in need across the boundaries where lies no liability for a head of state but for an affectionate human only. The value of vaccines sent through “Vaccine Maitri” can only be understood relative to the situation of those people were just like the importance of the mountain of medicinal herbs brought by Lord Hanuman in eyes of Lord Ram. This same spirit was reciprocated by Brazilian PM Bolsonaro with a tweet of Lord Hanuman bringing vaccines to Brazil thanking India for such a courageous and affectionate step.

Where world leaders often fail to acknowledge the dire situation of ecological imbalance and climate change PM Modi tackles them head-on as the initiative to revive the river Ganga is one of the kind in the whole world. The inclusionary spirit of PM Modi’s mode of working represented through “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas” has a wide enough ambit to include every person irrespective of the various divides and as mentioned earlier can permeate national boundaries itself. In this regard PM Modi is truly global in his impact as highlighted through various surveys magazines such as TIME magazine and other countries also. Religious harmony and developmental programs for minorities have been a top priority of the Modi Government which is clearly visible through scholarships and government initiatives for minority upliftment as the spirit of “The greatest good of greatest number” does not do justice to Indian diversity. The steps like Insurance for all Indians more than a billion vaccinations of COVID-19 free ration of food grains for all during and after the pandemic free housing for the poor through PM Avaas Yojna are some of the examples of emancipatory steps taken by PM Modi during his tenure which I am certain will see a surge of such initiatives in time to come. Women empowerment has not been only an agenda on manifesto as this section of society has seen consolidated steps in form of “Beti Bachao Beti Padao” Free gas and electricity connections and many more to alight the living conditions of families of rural India as development if not restricted to cities alone.

His Holiness Pope Francis was born in Argentina. On subjects connected to the church he supports conventional beliefs. However he has a socialist perspective on international events. He opted to live a less opulent lifestyle than his forebears.

He built a bridge connecting the USA and Cuba after years of estrangement and conflict by resolving diplomatic concerns between them. Members in the LGBT community find him friendly and welcoming. Pope Francis is a proponent of taking effective steps to address climate change. He has brought forth several church changes that have been well received by young Christians all across the world. Pope Francis prioritizes religious unity and has friendly connections with the leaders of Islamic countries such as Palestine and the United Arab Emirates. He believes it is the obligation of the entire world to sort out the hardship and challenges that people in war-torn places under ISIS and the Taliban face. He is a fervent supporter of Israeli-Palestinian peace.

Great minds make the world a better place… Through love and compassion great minds bring heaven to earth.Narendra Modi Ji and His Holiness The Pontiff.

There is no dispute to the claim that VP is one of the pioneers of the new age cinema that has evolved in the past decade and a half. For more than seventy years Tamil directors were caught in the trap of cramping all elements into the same movie. Though these films entertained the audiences very few of them were memorable.

In 2007 Venkat Prabhu made his breakthrough film 'Chennai 600028' that focussed on a single theme of street cricket and characters and plots evolved from it. The films success inspired many others who followed to come up with highly entertaining niche films.

VP never got into the trap of type casting his films and strived for different genres within the parameters of commercial cinema. If in 'Saroja' the events occurred on a single night in 'Mankatha' it revolved around a heist. In Goa he dealt with alternate sexuality explicitly for the first time in Tamil cinema without degrading it. His 'Goa'  a village to big bad city tale contained all the fun elements relating to that while his 'Biryani' was darker in its comedy.

Even the cruelly underrated 'Mass Engira Masilamani' gave an engrossing emotional twist to the horror genre which has never been done in any other film of this kind.

Venkat Prabhu continues his mission of giving his audiences something new and unexpected with his upcoming biggie 'Maanaadu'. The film deals with the scifi concept of time loop and after the riveting trailer it is easily one of the most anticipated films of the year.

Indiaglitz wishes the ever innovative filmmaker Venkat Prabhu the happiest birthday and many many more entertaining years ahead."

The 23-year-old center will play for the G League OKC Blue at 11 a.m. Then at 6 p.m. Roby will be active for the Thunder’s game against San Antonio.

It’s going to be a long day for Roby at Paycom Center where both games will be played. The same arena but different leagues different coaching staffs different uniforms and different opponents — the G League’s Salt Lake City Stars followed by the Spurs.

The Thunder announced Saturday that Roby had been assigned to the Blue but it’s likely to be a brief one-game stint before he’s recalled by the Thunder sometime Sunday afternoon between the two games.

“That’s one of those unique situations” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said.

Roby being sent to the Blue is a bit surprising especially considering where he was a season ago. Roby backed up Al Horford and when Horford was shut down Roby was the Thunder’s primary center. He averaged 23 minutes per game and made 34 starts.

But Roby has fallen out of the rotation this season playing behind veterans Derrick Favors and Mike Muscala and rookie Jeremiah Robinson-Earl. Roby has averaged just 10 minutes per game and he’s logged more DNPs (3) than starts (1).

'Drippiest player in the league':Why Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the Thunder's latest fashion icon

“Obviously he’s been squeezed out of the rotation the last few games and we want to get him a good run down there” Daigneault said. “See what he looks like see how he’s progressing.”

Such quick send-downs and call-ups weren’t possible last season. Because of the pandemic the entire G League season was played in an Orlando bubble much like the end of the 2019-20 NBA season.

Roby will join four other Thunder players with the Blue: rookies Tre Mann and Vit Krejci and two-way players Paul Watson and Aaron Wiggins who’s also a rookie. The Blue (1-0) crushed Salt Lake City 118-63 in its season opener on Friday.

“These are just things that we see as normal that we haven’t been able to execute because of COVID last year” Daigneault said of using the G League.

Roby averaged 8.7 points and 5.6 rebounds per game last season. This season in five games Roby has averaged 5.2 points and 2.2 rebounds. He’s a career 48% shooter in 69 games (35 starts).

Roby is technically in his third NBA season but Daigneault referred to Roby as a second-year player. Roby played in just three games in the 2019-20 season when he was traded to the Thunder from the Mavericks.

Roby is still relatively inexperienced but the Thunder got a good look at him last season. Now OKC is seeing what it has in Robinson-Earl a promising second-round rookie. As Daigneault put it “wanting to get some mileage on the car.”

Tramel's ScissorTales:Why can't the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Thunder?

“Jeremiah’s done a nice job” Daigneault said. “We trust him. But that’s not to say we don’t trust Isaiah. We’ve seen a lot of him. That’s partially why we want to have him go there is to keep him sharp see where he’s at. He’s gonna get his opportunities here as well.”

Like Roby Robinson-Earl is an undersized center who has the ability to stretch the floor. Roby is an athletic big who can handle the ball. Robinson-Earl is all grit and fundamentals.

Then there’s Favors who’s averaging 18 minutes per game and Muscala who’s playing 15 minutes per game.

“It’s hard to split minutes when it’s limited roles” Daigneault said “without creating a situation where no one can thrive because they’re playing such limited minutes.”

It remains to be seen if Roby will actually play in two games Sunday but he’s at least expected to be dressed out in both.

“That’s like a 13-hour day at the arena” Daigneault said. “There’s not a lot of time to go home in between.”

There’s also the physical toll to consider. With some players albeit mostly older players being “load managed” or sitting out on one night of a back-to-back is common. Playing two games in one day seems like a stretch by comparison.

The Thunder’s medical staff was consulted and Daigneault said the cumulative effect of a large workload is a bigger concern than one infrequent occasion of playing two games in one day.

“We’re gonna monitor that and it’s probably gonna be a little bit more case-by-case” Daigneault said. “In this case with Isaiah he’s gonna play in the game and he’s gonna reattach to us right after.”

'We’re watching a star evolve':How Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shines in the third quarter

Roby won’t be the first to do it. Not even the first to do it this season.

Warriors rookies Moses Moody and Jonathan Kuminga played 32 and 30 minutes respectively for G League Santa Cruz on Wednesday. Both then played two minutes later that day for Golden State.

That was one of two games the Santa Cruz Warriors will play at Chase Center in San Francisco this season. The Blue will play all of its home games at Paycom Center which it shares with the Thunder.

The Blue is the only G League team that will call an NBA arena its permanent home. It wasn’t far last season though when it played across the street at the former Cox Convention Center now Prairie Surf Studios.

The Blue will play 15 home games this season on the same day as a Thunder home game.

Roby won’t be the last to pull a doubleheader at Paycom Center.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this Fool Live video clip recorded on Oct. 21 Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel gives an overview of where PayPal's business stands today.

10 stocks we like better than PayPal Holdings

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and PayPal Holdings wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20 2021

Matt Frankel: I'll give you an overview of what PayPal does real quick. Everyone knows what they do they're a payment processor. They have grown tremendously. They're are a big company almost a $300 billion market cap they're roughly eight times the size of Pinterest (NYSE: PINS). This is definitely a manageable acquisition for them. It's not even as dilutive as say Square (NYSE: SQ) acquiring Afterpay in stock. They have 403 million active users. Those active users make 4.7 billion transactions individual purchases on PayPal's platform every quarter.

In the second quarter PayPal's payment volume was $1.2 trillion on an annualized basis. There's over $1 trillion flowing through PayPal's ecosystem. Venmo is the biggest growth area of the business I give Venmo payments all the time. We own a vacation rental and when friends stay there sometimes they'll Venmo me for some of the cost. That's growing really rapidly but it's still a pretty small part of PayPal's business $58 billion out of $311 billion in payment volume in the second quarter.

Growth is still very very good. The pandemic accelerated the digital payments transformation which is why PayPal's payment volume grew 40% year over year in the last quarter. Unlike a lot of these big fintech companies PayPal is consistently profitable. PayPal is expected to generate about $5 billion in free cash flow this year alone. Most acquisitions PayPal has made have been in cash and without taking out debt because the company is generating money that it's using to acquire businesses. Honey is the big recent example the discount shopping platform. That's the basics of the business. It started out as a subsidiary of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) not that long ago. Now eBay is down to just 4% of PayPal's revenue. A lot of big catalysts in PayPal's business.

“We’ve been working for a long time on creating multiple ways for taxpayers to access our office without coming in our door” Hall County Tax Commissioner Darla Eden said. “Today about the only reason for visiting our office is to title a vehicle.”

The preferred method is making online payments at hallcountytax.org by clicking on the ""property & mobile home tax"" button on the home page and following the prompts. Online payment methods include e-check ($1.50 flat fee) and debit/credit card (2.5% of amount plus $.30 cents per transaction). Most major credit cards are accepted.

The newest method of payment is with PayPal Credit which allows users to take up to six months to pay a property tax bill. The PayPal Credit payment option is a line of credit that is interest-free if paid in full within the six-month window.

Another option is payment by mail using the return envelope provided with the statement sent to the resident's address on file. Check or credit card info can be sent to P.O. Box 1579 Gainesville GA 30503. Payments must be postmarked by Nov. 15 2021 to avoid interest charges.

Residents may also call or text the tax office during business hours for assistance with credit and debit card payments. The phone number is (770) 531-6950 and the text number is (833) 602-8497.

Citizens may also utilize the drop box located in front of the main doors of the Hall County Government Center at 2875 Browns Bridge Road. Payments must be placed in the drop box on or before Nov. 15 to avoid state-mandated interest charges.

In-office tax payments paid in cash are allowed in the entrance lobby of the government center. Payments made by check or card will be handled at the information desk where a receipt can be mailed or emailed if requested.

The Hall County Tax Commissioner’s Office is open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzA3L2VhcnRocXVha2VzLXN0YXItY2hyaXMtd29uZG9sb3dza2ktYW5ub3VuY2VzLWhpcy1yZXRpcmVtZW50L9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzA3L2VhcnRocXVha2VzLXN0YXItY2hyaXMtd29uZG9sb3dza2ktYW5ub3VuY2VzLWhpcy1yZXRpcmVtZW50L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earthquakes star Chris Wondolowski MLS all-time leading scorer announces his retirement,"SAN JOSE – Chris Wondolowski always spoke about his love of the fans.

It played a part in his decision not to retire after the 2020 season which was played in empty stadiums during the pandemic because he wanted to play in front of spectators again. When he was suspended for a game in 2019 he stood and cheered for his Earthquakes teammates from the supporters’ section at PayPal Park.

So when it came time to make his retirement announcement Sunday he wanted to let the fans know first.

Minutes after the Quakes season ended with a 1-1 tie against FC Dallas on Sunday the 38-year-old forward took the mic and told the 17075 in attendance that his 17-year career was ending.

“Instead of doing this at a press conference instead of a bunch of cameras I wanted to do it in front of you guys because you guys have been there from Day 1” Wondolowski said. “But this is the last ride.”

The leading goal scorer in MLS history gave fans one last highlight to remember him by scoring his 171st career goal in the 34th minute by slotting a cross from Marcos Lopez into the left side netting from the center of the box. He finishes with 26 more career goals than Landon Donovan who is second on the scoring list.

The crowd Sunday included his parents his wife and his two young daughters — with a third child on the way. It also included his teammates from every stage of his development — Danville’s Mustang Soccer youth program De La Salle High and Chico State.

“It’s been an amazing ride” Wondolowski said. “It starts with my teammates. That’s what I’ll miss is the practices the locker room the battles.”

Wondolowski leaves at a time of huge uncertainty for the franchise. General manager Jesse Fioranelli was fired in June and has not been replaced. Coach Matias Almeyda may be departing as well after a disappointing season.

The hometown kid didn't want to do it in a press conference. He wanted to announce it in front of the San Jose faithful. Legend.#WondoForever ∞ pic.twitter.com/eeEchG9chd — San Jose Earthquakes (@SJEarthquakes) November 8 2021

Wondolowski was drafted by the team in the fourth round of the 2005 MLS Supplemental Draft and started 313 games with the Quakes 85 more than any other player. He moved with the team to Houston in 2006 but returned via trade in 2009 one year after MLS returned to San Jose with an expansion team.

For a team that hasn’t had recent playoff success — the Quakes haven’t had a winning season since 2013 and last won a playoff game in 2012 — many of the on-field highlights have come from No. 8 who quickly become the face of the franchise.

Wondolowski scored double-digit goals every season from 2010-19 and then had a team-high nine goals in all competitions for the Earthquakes in 2020.

But he took on a sharply reduced role this season. He made just nine starts and scored five goals for the Quakes (10-13-11) who finished in 10th place in the 13-team Western Conference seven points out of the playoffs.

Though Wondolowski didn’t talk about his future leading up to the game there were hints before kickoff that it would be his last appearance.

A video montage for the captain was shown before the game fans received a Wondo hat as a giveaway and the forward was led onto the field by his daughters Emersyn and Brynlee.

At halftime and again in the 70th minute fans were told to stay in their seats for a special presentation immediately after the game.

The crowd chanted “Wondo” and “One More Year” as Wondolowski took the mic and told everyone the news.

“Thank you guys for this wonderful ride” Wondolowski said after playing the full 90 minutes. “Thank you for pushing me on and I can’t think you guys enough.”

After speaking to the crowd a highlight package was shown on the videoboard and he was lifted into the air by his teammates at the center of the field.",,,,,,

""Lake Merritt made it a place for us to be able to come and be our own bosses"" said Amber Johnson a vendor at the Black International Marketplace. Oakland created the popup bazaar at the northeast tip of Lake Merritt as a way to help African Americans realize their dreams of owning their own businesses.

""This is our first step"" Johnson said. ""We all would love to have a storefront. We all would love to be able to leave something for our kids because of lot of us are breaking the cycle out here A lot of us our parents never went to college or never finished high school.""

So this was a great place for Pepsi to kick off ""Dig In Day"" a nationwide effort to support Black-owned restaurants with the goal of generating $100 million of new business over the next five years.

""A lot of consumers want to give back to Black communities but they don't know how to do it. Pepsi Dig In Day is a great way to start"" said Ron Walker PepsiCo's national account sales manager.

Trap Kitchen has a physical location in downtown Oakland but on Saturday they fed people at Lake Merritt for free from a food truck provided by Pepsi. On the menu was Cajun-style barbecue chicken and mac and cheese or vegan-style mac and cheese. Pepsi paid Trap Kitchen for each meal handed out and diners were being encouraged to use an online ""Dig In Passport"" to record their receipts from other Black-owned restaurants as a way to keep track of the new business generated.

""I think the most important thing that helps is just the word of mouth letting people know that we exist"" said Trap Kitchen owner Oscar Edwards. ""The money helps but money only goes so far. Word of mouth travels forever.""

A lot of that word of mouth came from 10-year old Ezekial Brooks who was handing out food with a side order of salesmanship.

""How's the food?"" he asked getting a thumbs up. ""Yeah! I'm generous. I love to give away stuff!""

Saturday the food was free but the hope is that by consciously steering customers to Black-owned restaurants and businesses they can create a kind of virtual International Marketplace like the one they built at Lake Merritt.

""All the people that look like me are out here"" said vendor Amber Johnson ""and it just motivates me to keep going -- like there's a place for us.""

The ""Dig In Passport"" identifies Black-owned restaurants in various cities and uploads receipts to track purchases and earn rewards like gift cards and cooking classes.

David Letterman didn’t believe Dana Carvey.

The imp-faced comic had just left Saturday Night Live after a white-hot run that reanimated the show’s nearly dead comedy corpse. Rumors had Dana actually taking over Letterman’s time slot (Dave’s contract was up) but that wasn’t meant to be. So what does a sketch comic do after leaving America’s most visible sketch comedy show?

“I kind of decided that it would be fun to do sketch comedy again” Carvey said in the documentary Too Funny to Fail: The Life and Death of the Dana Carvey Show. In case that sounded like he was just repeating himself he added an important caveat. “But with more creative freedom.”

Doing more sketch wasn’t hard to believe. But Letterman wasn’t buying the show’s title. Carvey says at first it was some kind of post-modern joke.

""Yeah it’s called The Taco Bell Dana Carvey Show.""

Shameless

Post-modern joke yes. But it was also good old-fashioned nostalgia.

NBC TV Nothing says laughs like the fight against cavities plaque and gingivitis.

“I grew up with ‘Chevrolet presents Red Skelton’"" says Carvey. “The new Red Skelton Show presented by PET Evaporated Milk.” The winking title gimmick of The Taco Bell Dana Carvey Show was 90's irony-funny but it was also an homage to all the comedy variety shows that had come before.

At first advertisers were eager to get in on the joke. It didn’t take long to set a line-up of presenting sponsors for the first slate of Carvey shows although maybe Mug Root Beer and Diet Mug Root Beer shouldn’t count as separate products:

Advertisement

""The Taco Bell Dana Carvey Show""

""The Mug Root Beer Dana Carvey Show""

""The Mountain Dew Dana Carvey Show""

""The Diet Mug Root Beer Dana Carvey Show""

""The Pepsi Stuff Dana Carvey Show""

The show titles just sounded funny. But the joke didn’t stop there. The first show with Taco Bell as the sponsor began with a hokey production number -- dancing tacos joined with dancing bells in a parody of the old 70s variety show opens.

Advertisement

The post-modern part came when the dancers presented Carvey with an oversized novelty check congratulating him on his status as a ""shameless whore."" Cue a Taco Bell brand manager watching at home and swallowing hard.

But it got worse for Taco Bell.

The Dana Carvey Show’s writers’ room was a murderer’s row: Louis C.K. Robert Smigel Charlie Kaufman Steven Colbert Steve Carell Robert (30 Rock Kimmy Schmidt) Carlock Dino (Conan Mr. Show) Stamatopoulos and Carvey himself. If it wasn’t the greatest collection of comedy scribes ever assembled it might have been the meanest the most subversive the most willing to risk it all to see what they could get away with.

For the first show that meant opening with Carvey doing Bill Clinton as a President so in touch with his feelings that he opened his shirt and breastfed puppies. In prime time. Right after sappy family sitcom Home Improvement.

Pepsico which owned Taco Bell Pizza Hut and all the rest was not amused by having sponsored a lactating President.

Artistic Chernobyl

“Taco Bell got a million letters” says writer Bob Smigel. “And they announced ""We are no longer associated with The Dana Carvey Show.""

Deliro Films Note to staff: Advertisers don't like calling Princess Diana a slut.

Taco Bell and Pizza Hut pulled advertising shortly after the show’s premiere. A Pizza Hut exec said that the company didn’t feel comfortable with the show’s humor explaining that several sketches “went too far.” At $600000 an episode the dual pull-out cost the show more than a million bucks (even though for some reason the corporate giant’s soft drinks stayed on as sponsors).

Advertisement

“I love how sponsors dropped Dana Carvey for having cats feeding off Bill Clinton’s nipples—but shouldn’t sponsors drop the White House?” asked cast member Elon Gold. “You know after Bill Clinton gets a blowjob?""

TV critic Howard Rosenberg on the other hand thought Taco Bell did exactly the right thing writing “Some will accuse Taco Bell of timidity. On the contrary they should be lauded for their good taste in changing their minds after looking at the limp tamale they were sponsoring and correctly judging it to be an artistic Chernobyl.""

Even today reruns of that episode on Crackle have the Taco Bell song edited out.

You’d expect all this would have restrained the shows’ writers and encouraged caution. Nope. Instead they leaned in poking fun at corporate cowardice in the following week’s show. Mug Root Beer dancers poked back in the opening song:

Deliro Films Who says Mug Root Beer drinkers can't dance?

Advertisement

Advertisement

There are certain words Dana better not say! And he better not breastfeed any puppies today or we will sure as hell will be on our way!

So be careful you little punk -- Dana Carvey!

And then the show started talking trash about the products themselves. The Mountain Dew open featured unsavory dancers like Citric Acid Sodium Benzoate and High Fructose Corn Syrup.

Deliro Films You don't want to see what Sodium Benzoate Guy was wearing.

“That was the one time I can remember” says Smigel “where we actually implied that there was something unappealing about the actual product.”

“We lost a sponsor every week” says Carvey. “Sponsors were bailing out like crazy.”

Can you blame them? “When you bite the hand that feeds you that hard” says show director John Fortenberry “there's a good chance you're not gonna get fed again.”

Writer Spike Feresten concurs. “The only way you're staying on the air is to make somebody money. You gotta make somebody money.”

Things got so bad that the show’s final sponsor was a local Chinese restaurant that the cast and crew frequented.

Deliro Films Show producers get free delivery and egg rolls with every national ad.

Dana Carvey has a hell of a show! And at Szechuan Dynasty you can order to go!

It was another joke and yet it wasn’t. For a show hungry for sponsors take-out Chinese was all it had left. ABC dumped the show after eight episodes.

Does your brand talk about bae?

Fast-forward twenty-five years. Holy Mountain Dew how things have changed.

The same “isn’t advertising ridiculous?” meta-jokes that killed Carvey have become the go-to for Sassy Corporate Twitter. Post-modern gags aren’t anathema for advertisers--they’re the norm. If as the Washington Post claims millennial humor is weird then corporate social media wants on that bus.

Denny's Denny's is dope. Literally.

Advertisement

While Taco Bell was terrified to be in close proximity to Bill Clinton’s nipples Denny’s is perfectly happy to embrace being the 1 a.m. destination of choice for stoners everywhere. We live in a world where Hamburger Helper drops mixtapes and not everyone hates it.

Advertisement

For big brands it’s not an entirely risk-free strategy. Twitter accounts like Brands Saying Bae keep track of old ad guys trying to sound hep by appropriating language they read in a parents’ guide to teen slang. The result sounds like broken English -- almost right but awkward the advertising equivalent of that Buscemi meme.

NBC Studios How do you do fellow kids?

Many companies believe the risks of getting cozy with edgy comedy are worth the rewards. Wendy’s (itself a Sassy Twitter Brand) has found a number of ways to portal gun into the Rick and Morty universe including this ad for new breakfast items.

Advertisement

Like The Dana Carvey Show and Mountain Dew Rick and Morty ridicules the very products it’s advertising -- funky breakfast offerings like the Breakfast Baconator Frosty-ccino and Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit (a bruiser who threateningly pounds a lead pipe into its palm). Our heroes want nothing to do with promoting Wendy’s products so they take off running with the food in hot pursuit.

Advertisement

That’s OK with Wendy’s. It gets the joke and pays good money to be in on it.

But what about the risks for Rick and Morty? Fan-favorite shows don’t stay favorites by appearing to sell out to the highest bidder. Maintaining ironic credibility is a tricky balance says the show’s co-creator Justin Roiland.

“When I'm writing those commercials I try to just poke fun at the concept of advertising” Roiland says. “My whole goal with writing those commercials is trying to stay true to the characters trying to keep Rick cynical. Rick is the type of person that would see right through any f**king advertisement and who these big corporations are the whole corporations weighing in on socio-political stuff. It's just so f**king ridiculous. It's funny to me and Rick is somebody who would see right through that s**t.”

Advertisement

As long as Rick can effectively give the middle finger to Wendy’s -- and Wendy’s is OK with it -- then everyone is happy. That means more “eff you” commercials like this one where family members are sacrificed to the evil breakfast food.

Advertisement

Not enough? To celebrate the show’s fifth season Wendy’s transformed one of their California locations into a pop-up called Morty’s. In keeping with the show’s sensibilities cars had to drive through a grotesque Morty-mouth to order up a Big Bacon Classic. ‘Wendy’ looks properly morty-fied at the prospect.

Wendy's The restaurant that makes you never want to eat again.

We’ve come a long way from the days when companies were afraid to take these kinds of comedy risks. It’s too bad Dana Carvey’s product-poking humor came along twenty years early for him to reap the profits. Or did it?

UberEats How do you do fellow kids?

Pfizer one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies became a household name in 2020 when it was the first to have its COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use by the FDA. Now in early November 2021 the CDC is recommending the Pfizer vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11. This is welcome news for many parents who have been waiting for the go-ahead to vaccinate their young kids.

The vaccine originally came under development in April 2020 when Pfizer announced its partnership with German biotechnology company BioNTech. BioNTech contributed mRNA vaccine candidates while Pfizer led the charge with clinical research and development of the vaccine as well as manufacturing and distribution.

On Dec. 11 2020 the mRNA two-dose vaccine was officially cleared for use in the U.S.; and just a week later Moderna’s vaccine was also cleared. Between these two vaccines and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine 424 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered reaching 58.1% of the American population according to Our World in Data.

Here’s a closer look at Pfizer and what made it a leader in the COVID-19 vaccine race.

1. Pfizer Found Success During World War II

Founded in 1849 by German emigrants Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart the company was started in Williamsburg Brooklyn New York and remains headquartered in the same city today. The company found its first major success in producing penicillin when the drug suffered a shortage during World War II.

Pfizer continued its expansion and in 1980 began selling an anti-inflammatory drug called Feldene — its first product to reach $1 billion in sales. Before 2000 the company grew by marketing drugs such as Zoloft Lipitor Norvasc and Viagra and has since reached unprecedented levels of success through multiple acquisitions and a consumer healthcare division.

2. High Market Cap Low Share Value

Although Pfizer is clearly worth a lot of money — $215.2 billion to be exact — the value of its stock hasn’t increased much in the past year. At close on March 1 2020 one share of Pfizer was worth $30.97. In recent months it’s hovered around $40-$50 closing out Nov. 2 at $45.45.

Still there are plenty of experts urging investors to stake their claim in Pfizer. The company has sustained setbacks both with its legacy drugs and with recent clinical studies on a breast cancer drug but the success of the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to propel the stock higher.

3. Pfizer Revenue Increased 2% in 2020

Despite producing a successful COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer made $41.9 billion in 2020; an increase of only 2% from its 2019 revenue. But there are good reasons for this. The foremost being much higher operations costs as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. And the company didn’t even begin vaccine distribution until FDA approval on Dec. 11.

4. The Company Is Raking In the Dough This Year Though

Although 2020 was the setup 2021 is a year to reap the benefits. Originally an analysis by Quartz put Pfizer’s vaccine profits this year at $15 billion whereas Morgan Stanley anticipated $19 billion in profits. But Pfizer’s most recent forecast — which takes into account its booster shots and vaccine for kids — places full-year sales at an astounding $36 billion with the company making $13 billion in the third quarter alone.

5. Vaccine Prices Could Increase After the Pandemic

In accordance with Pfizer’s deal with the U.S. government Americans who have wanted to have been able to get vaccinated for free. But that may not always be the case. Moving forward Pfizer has announced that there is a “significant opportunity” to ramp up the prices of the vaccine.

Frank D’Amelio Pfizer’s CFO has claimed that once the pandemic shifts into an “endemic” state — essentially when most places are vaccinated restricting COVID-19 cases to certain pockets of the world — it will create an opportunity for Pfizer to increase the pricing of its vaccine. This will likely make it harder for low-resource communities to get vaccinated.

Parents teachers and pediatricians have been eagerly waiting to find out when exactly younger Americans will have a shot at getting a COVID-19 vaccine. That wait is over now that the U.S. has authorized kid-size doses of the Pfizer vaccine making it available for the up to 28 million American children who are between the ages of 5 and 11. Below is everything you need to know about the rollout of kids’ COVID-19 vaccines.

Where and when will the shots be available?

Because the Pfizer COVID vaccine for kids is an entirely new distribution program with smaller doses and smaller syringes it won’t be instantly available like booster shots for adults after they were authorized. Specially designed packages of the Pfizer COVID vaccine for children will be shipped immediately now that the CDC has given the final sign-off to the vaccine. That means vaccination appointments for children will likely ramp up in the coming days.

“We are now beginning to roll out to distribute the vaccine to give parents the information that they need” CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC’s Good Morning America. “Go talk to your pediatrician your trusted health-care provider your pharmacist and get the information that you need as we start scaling up vaccines across this country.”

Nationally the Biden administration plans to make the vaccine available at more than 25000 pediatricians’ and doctors’ offices. The government site Vaccines.gov lists places where kids can get vaccinated in their neighborhood. CVS and Walgreens already accept appointments for COVID-19 vaccines for children; many school districts throughout the country like Austin and New York City will also serve as locations for administering kid-size jabs. The White House says it has ordered enough shots to vaccinate all 5- to 11-year-olds in the country.

Prior to making an appointment parents should mention their child’s exact age according to emergency physician and professor of health policy at George Washington University Dr. Leana Wen. “If they are not sure yet call back the next day — a lot is changing very quickly.”

What do we know about the Pfizer COVID vaccine for children?

Last week the FDA signed off on an emergency-use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine for kids between the ages of 5 and 11 last week. On Tuesday advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted unanimously to recommend the vaccine and CDC director Rochelle Walensky signed off as well.

As with teens and adults children will get two doses spaced three weeks apart but the child-sized doses of the Pfizer vaccine are just a third of the amount. (They’ll still need to wait 15 minutes after getting the shot to watch for side effects.) According to NPR the kiddie vaccine also differs from the existing formulation that teens and adults get in that it can be stored in a refrigerator for up to ten weeks.

Is the Pfizer COVID vaccine safe for kids?

Yes. Last week the FDA advisory panel voted in favor of approval on the basis of clinical-trial data showing that the Pfizer shot is about 91 percent effective at preventing symptomatic infection in 5- to 11-year-olds. The data from the trial of 2268 participants shows that it’s safe: Though mRNA-based vaccines have been linked to a very small risk of myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) there were no reports of the condition in kids who participated in the trial. The dosage for children also proved safe with similar or fewer temporary reactions to the vaccine — such as sore arms fever or aches — that teens experience.

The American Academy of Pediatrics issued the go-ahead in a press release on Tuesday. “Vaccinating children will protect children’s health and allow them to fully engage in all of the activities that are so important to their health and development” it said. “The AAP recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all children and adolescents 5 years of age and older who do not have contraindications using a vaccine authorized for use for their age.”

When will other kinds of COVID vaccines be available for kids?

For now the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots are only available to people 18 years of age and older. The Moderna mRNA vaccine is still being studied in young children and teens and both Pfizer and Moderna are testing jabs for babies and preschoolers. Meanwhile Johnson & Johnson is well behind: It’s expected to begin vaccine trials of its shot for young kids in the future but has not yet begun a trial for ages 16 and under.

These vaccines still have to go through the same authorization process that the Pfizer vaccine has just undergone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYmEtYm9vc3Rlci1zaG90LXJlY29tbWVuZGF0aW9uLWFw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA to players coaches refs: Booster shots are recommended,"MIAMI (AP) — The NBA told its players coaches and referees on Sunday that they should receive booster shots against the coronavirus with particular urgency for those who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

The league and the National Basketball Players Association — working jointly based on guidance from the NBA’s public health and infectious disease experts — said those who received Johnson & Johnson shots more than two months ago should get a booster. The booster recommendation also was made for those who received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine at least six months ago.

The league recommendations which were obtained by The Associated Press called for those who got Johnson & Johnson vaccines originally to seek a Pfizer or Moderna booster. Those who got Pfizer or Moderna may simply get whatever booster is available the league said.

Data used to make the league’s determinations showed that antibody levels for Pfizer and Moderna recipients wane after six months and after two months for Johnson & Johnson recipients.

Some teams already have been planning for players to receive booster shots when available. A small number of previously vaccinated NBA players have tested positive this season for COVID-19 and entered the league’s health and safety protocols.

Among those sidelined of late: Philadelphia’s Tobias Harris who had symptoms 76ers coach Doc Rivers said.

“He’s doing OK but not great honestly. … It hit him for sure” Rivers said last week. “A lot of guys have had this and they are mad like ‘What the hell I’m fine.’ Tobias is not in that category right now I can tell you that.”

In some cases those who are vaccinated but elect to not receive a booster would be subjected to game-day testing again starting Dec. 1 the NBA said. That Dec. 1 date varies depending on when the person was originally vaccinated and what type of vaccine they received.

About 97% of NBA players were believed to be vaccinated when the season started last month. In the U.S. nearly 60% of the population — more than 193 million people — are fully vaccinated. More than 21 million have received a booster dose and those numbers are soaring each day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JydWNlbGVlLzIwMjEvMTEvMDYvd2FzLXBmaXplci1jZW8tYWxiZXJ0LWJvdXJsYS1yZWFsbHktYXJyZXN0ZWQtaGVyZXMtaG93LXVuZm91bmRlZC0tY2xhaW1zLWVtZXJnZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla Was Not Arrested Here's How This Conspiracy Theory Emerged,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/11/06/was-pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-really-arrested-heres-how-unfounded--claims-emerged/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JydWNlbGVlLzIwMjEvMTEvMDYvd2FzLXBmaXplci1jZW8tYWxiZXJ0LWJvdXJsYS1yZWFsbHktYXJyZXN0ZWQtaGVyZXMtaG93LXVuZm91bmRlZC0tY2xhaW1zLWVtZXJnZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League."

The report calls on policy makers investors and forest product customers to leverage the potential of sustainable working forests and their products in the transition to a net-zero economy.

The report launched at COP26 in Glasgow was developed by FSG members in consultation with 21 key stakeholders and support from PwC Canada. It describes the role of forests and forest products in supporting the transition towards a net-zero nature positive and equitable future for 9+billion people to live well within planetary boundaries by 2050. The Roadmap focuses on three levers that constitute the unique potential of the forest sector to support the net-zero transition:

Reduce greenhouse gas emissions in operations and across the value chain;

Increase carbon removals through sequestration in sustainable working forests and storage in forest products;

Grow the circular bioeconomy through the substitution of non-renewable and fossil-based materials with forest products.

The climate change mitigation potential of all three levers is cumulative and forest companies are encouraged to act on all simultaneously while prioritizing emissions reductions. The report also supports forest companies in their decision-making by describing key opportunity spaces where business can take action to realize the potential of all three levers. As sustainable working forests and their products are often overlooked as a solution to reach net-zero to drive impact at scale policymakers investors and customers must recognize and leverage this potential.

A second report will follow in 2022 providing guidance for business in the forest sector to drive ambitious and science-based net-zero strategies based on global accounting frameworks and best practice examples.

FSG members include: BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group CMPC Drax Group Enviva Hancock Natural Resource Group International Paper Company Mondi Group New Forests Philip Morris International Sappi Limited Smurfit Kappa Group Stora Enso Sumitomo Forestry The Navigator Company Weyerhaeuser.

Annika Bresky President and CEO of Stora Enso and member of WBCSD’s Executive Committee highlighted that “The forest sector has the opportunity to become climate and nature positive. But the forest sector alone cannot bring to market the solutions the world needs to transition to a net-zero and nature-positive economy. It will require concerted and collaborative action across the full value chains and with investors civil society and governments.

Francisco Ruiz-Tagle CEO CMPC added that “As stewards of sustainable working forests and manufacturers of wood-based products the forest sector faces a unique opportunity to enable the global transition to a net-zero economy through the provision of scalable and cost-effective solutions for carbon capture and storage. A change in mindset within the sector and beyond will allow to unleash the full transformative potential of the forest sector.”

Diane Holdorf Executive Vice President WBCSD highlighted that: “It has been very encouraging to see so many big announcements in this Climate COP to address deforestation and land use change. But now is the time for urgent collective action. The Forest Sector Net-Zero Roadmap launched today by WBCSD members and partners delivers a blueprint to accelerate mobilization of the full forest sector value chain to drive the inclusive net-zero and nature positive future we urgently need.”

Business Reporter

Since the coronavirus pandemic was first detected in December 2019 it has claimed five million lives across the globe. It is staggering.

Perhaps more grimmer are lives lost to one of the world’s silent killers — smoking.

Before the year is out more than eight million people would have died.

In 1997 the Global Burden on Disease (GBD) study estimated that around three million people were dying annually from smoking and projected a future sharp increase.

It has since come to pass as mortalities rose to five million by 2002 at which point the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated deaths would reach eight million by 2030.

“But we are already there” said Mr Harry Shapiro the director of DrugWise an online drug information service at the recent launch of the Global State of Tobacco Harm Reduction (GSTHR) report.

“So I think it’s fair to say whatever tobacco controls are in place across the world they are simply not enough to put a significant dent on these really awful predictions . . .

“In the interest of global public health a sensible and pragmatic response would be to take seriously the opportunities offered by the advent of safer nicotine products which now a welter of independent evidence shows they are substantially safer than smoking they help current smokers both switch away from smoking and offer a safe route to cessation while at the same time offering little risk to bystanders.

“So if you actually want to help smokers that’s what you do” he said.

Yet WHO which adopted the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2005 to try to promote policies designed to move away from tobacco has been dithering on actively pushing for alternatives to smoking that have been scientifically proven to be significantly efficacious in reducing smoking-related diseases and deaths.

Over the past 16 years the emergence of technologically enabled non-combustible nicotine delivery products such as e-cigarettes vapers and heat-not-burn products among others has helped smokers switch to safer products helping to reduce extreme health outcomes.

According to Mr Shapiro the WHO FCTC and its allies which are bankrolled by anti-tobacco lobbyists seem to be obsessed with “fighting a last war against tobacco” even when “there is recognition of failing tobacco-control policies”.

“Billions of smokers are paying the price” he added.

New trends

Safer nicotine products have been gaining popularity. Since 2006 there are now 100 million users of safer nicotine products while in the last decade 75 000 patents have been filed in the area of reduced-risk products.

“Many of them are way upfront. If you have companies like Swedish Match having 40 percent of their revenue from reduced-risk products PMI (Philip Morris International) is now 30 percent BAT is at 12 percent that are pretty good starting point from zero not too long ago” said Dr David Yach a global health expert and anti-smoking advocate for more than 30 years.

He previously worked at the WHO where he was involved in developing the FCTC.

“We never anticipated new technology to accelerate people to quit smoking.”

Governments he added should make it easier for companies that produce safer products. On its part Zimbabwe is mulling a “sin tax” to both finance the health budget and continue fighting non-communicable diseases.

Presenting a position paper on the 2022 Budget at the recent pre-budget seminar in Victoria Falls Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga who also doubles as Health and Child Care Minister said: “It is also proposed that a certain number of cigarettes be reserved for financing health; for example for every five packets sold one goes to the national health services.”

Experts believe public health experts should go further through policies that make safer nicotine products easily accessible and cheaper for consumers particularly in low-income countries. There is a push for the WHO and other organisations such as the UK Royal College of Physicians and the US Food and Drug Administration — which are considered influential global health bodies — to add their voice to products that have demonstrably shown their ability to reduce smoking-related diseases and death.

Consumers too want their sit at the table.

Mr Tom Gleeson the co-founder of New Nicotine Alliance Ireland says there are now more than 50 consumer-led organisations promoting harm reduction around the world.

“Tobacco controls total rejection of the tobacco industry has only served to marginalise the development of harm reduction. The industry research on these products is excluded and all that data and evidence is lost to them” he said.

“Furthermore without the oversight of those regulatory bodies there is risk of losing the vital opportunity to reduce harm . . . Tobacco control to be most effective must encompass regulators manufactures and consumers.”

Pressure is increasingly building on the WHO to change direction and tact by taking into account the built-up of scientific data supporting harm reduction in order to save lives.

The stakes are too high.

Experts estimate that smoking-related deaths might top one billion by end of the century.

From the Hip Photo

A double dose of new options arrived at the 9+CO development on Colorado Boulevard this week: Culinary Dropout and Blanco Cocina + Cantina both from Arizona-based Fox Restaurant Concepts which also owns North Italia and Flower Child.Even more tacos hit the scene with the debut of a third Cochino in Arvada. Restaurateur Johnny Ballen launched his first Cochino in a former Phillips 66 station at 3495 South Downing Street in Englewood in 2016 and followed that up in 2019 with an outpost at 176 South Broadway in what had been Gary Lee's Motor Club & Grub (and was a mechanic's garage before that). The new location was purchased from the Little Pub Company which ran 4Barrel Bar & BBQ there for four and a half years in a structure that was built as a Texaco service station in the 1950s.Mochi doughnuts got a boost in Aurora with the arrival of Mochinut which serves the chewy baked goods as well as a lineup of Korean rice flour hot dogs including a cheese-stuffed version coated in hot Cheeto dust.A new winery opened in Englewood on November 5. Ladrón Cellars produces wine with fruit sourced from Colorado California's Central Coast (Paso Robles) and Washington and describes its philosophy as ""drinking local-ish."" The location has a tasting room and large patio as well as an on-site barrel room.Lea Jane's Hot Chicken made a move. After closing its location inside Avanti Denver it's now in a brick-and-mortar spot in RiNo and is planning to open two more locations in Englewood and near the University of Denver. But the DU area already has a new option thanks to the addition of a second location of Istanbul Cafe where you can find baklava Turkish-style panini meat-stuffed borek made with flaky pastry dough and more.But while there are some new treats in town Halloween also brought two tricks. Restaurateur Troy Guard's Big Wave Tacos was only open for a year inside the Junction food hall on South Colorado Boulevard before TAG Restaurant Group decided to shutter it on October 31 in order to concentrate on other ventures. Tooey's Off Colfax had been a neighborhood staple since 2008 before it announced its closure in December 2020 ; it reopened again for a while but officially called it quits on October 31 too.

Asserting that the party has not yet reached the pinnacle of success BJP President JP Nadda has given a call to the rank and file to increase the political footprint of the organisation to the level of all the 10.4 Lakh polling booths across the country by December-end and appoint panna pramukhs at these booths by next April. He emphasised on increasing its outreach to the southern states and putting in all efforts to win the forthcoming Assembly elections in five states.In his inaugural address to the one-day conclave of newly constituted BJP national executive in Delhi on Sunday Nadda hailed the performance of the party in “almost” all Assembly elections by-elections and local bodies polls held since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic. He also lauded efforts of the Narendra Modi government in administering of 108 crore doses of the Covid vaccine the increasing return to normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir the improvement in the economy and steps taken for the welfare of farmers.In a press interaction Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Nadda emphasised that the party has not yet reached its peak despite electoral successes. He exhorted the party cadre to form booth committees in all the 1040000 booths across the country. While 85% has already been covered the remaining should be formed by December 25 2021. He also directed that panna pramukhs (incharge of each page of a voters’ list in a booth) should be appointed by April 6 2022 the anniversary of BJP’s formation.“An institutional mechanism should also be established by the party for propagation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann ki Baat at the booth level” Pradhan said quoting Nadda.The BJP Chief did not make a specific mention of the setbacks in the recent by-elections in Himachal Pradesh Rajasthan and West Bengal. However he dwelt at length on the political violence in West Bengal. Nadda directed the party cadre to work toward winning the forthcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand Punjab Goa and Manipur.On West Bengal Nadda said BJP is not going to sit quiet on the on-going political violence in the state which has claimed the lives of 53 party workers since the Assembly polls. ""We will fight democratically against the unlawful administration and the lotus (BJP symbol) will bloom in the next election"" Nadda said.The BJP President said the party has increased its poll percentage from almost negligible in 2016 polls to 38% in 2021. He said BJP has 18 MPs and won 77 Assembly seats in the state. Even vaccinations are being done on party lines he alleged and there is ""height of in-humanism"" in the state.Underlining the party’s electoral performance in recent polls Nadda said “BJP has achieved spectacular victories in almost all elections held post-Covid be it the vidhan Sabha polls or the by-elections or local bodies. In Assam and Bihar we have formed a government with clear majority once again. In Puducherry we have formed a government for the first time. In West Bengal we have emerged as the main opposition.”There is a need to further strengthen the party in Kerala Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu and Odisha the BJP president said. He mentioned the recent by-poll victory in Huzurabad seat in Telangana and said the party has been doing well in the state. Under Amit Shah’s presidentship the party had improved had grown deeper roots in Assam Tripura and the North-East and the same needs to be done in the southern states now.The BJP Chief was all praise for the Modi government. He said two Covid vaccines were developed in no time and the target of 100 crore vaccinations was achieved in nine months exceeding the jabs given in Europe which stood at around 75 crore.He also underlined the progress made in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 and the growth in India’s standing globally on the issue of protecting the environment and fighting climate change.Nadda made overtures to the Sikhs ostensibly in view of the polls in Punjab and the on-going protests against the three farm laws in the state and western Uttar Pradesh. He said the Modi government removed the hurdles in Gurudwaras getting foreign contributions due to FCRA restrictions removing GST on langars spending Rs 120 Crore on development of Kartarpur Corridor and forming an SIT to find the guilty in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and punishing them.On the issue of farmers’ welfare Nadda said the Modi government has increased the expenditure provisions in the budget on farmers from Rs 23000 Crore to Rs 123000 Crore increased the MSP on crops and increased procurement under MSP from Rs 35000 Cr to Rs 85000 cr.Nadda also emphasised that the ideological goals of the party have also been achieved under the Prime Ministership of Narendra Modi. Article 370 has been abrogated the Ram temple at Ayodhya is under construction Citizenship Amendment Act has been passed and Triple Talaq has been banned.The hybrid session was attended by 124 members of the national executive physically while state unit presidents and chief ministers (barring Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath) joined virtually. Party veterans LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi participated virtually from their homes. The registration of 342 members was done digitally with the Prime Minister leading the group.

PITTSBURGH PA Nov. 8 2021 – PNC Bank today announced that Cathy Niederberger director of Community Development Banking will retire in early 2022 after a 25-year career with the bank. Reymundo “Rey” Ocañas who currently serves as the Southwest Territory executive for PNC’s Community Development Banking will assume leadership of the Community Development Banking function for PNC in January 2022.

Its chef-owner Debonette Wyatt-James found the vacant storefront and negotiated a lease for her vegan inspired takeout food offerings.

“The diversity of this neighborhood amazes me” she said one day this week. “I hadn’t counted on it.”

Wyatt-James who was born in Newark New Jersey came to Baltimore via Silver Spring where she had been a Macy’s department store cosmetics executive. She worked for some years at the Wheaton Mall but wanted to pursue a different career.

“I used to watch my own mama cook” she said. “I watched her make macaroni and cheese and potato salad. I myself am not a strict vegan. I’m more of a vegetarian. I like a little cheese sometimes.”

She said she was delighted when another neighborhood-based group Waverly Main Street noted her presence along Greenmount Avenue and gave her umbrellas tables and chairs so her patrons could sit outdoors and enjoy perhaps her best selling entrée a bacon cheeseburger that is actually vegan. The chairs reinforced the concept that this is a cafe not merely a carryout.

She said her flavored cauliflower bits are also a popular menu item.

She said the idea of outdoor dining on Greenmount Avenue was so encouraging that she is now raising money to open a back garden eating area along the 30th Street side of her business.

She works alongside her son Khair a chef and her husband Devin James who worked out construction logistics at the property when she leased it a year ago.

Nearby residents noticed her effort.

“She cares about bringing people to the neighborhood and not just being a carryout” said C. Ryan Patterson who lives on a side street near Wyatt-James’s business. “Greenmount Avenue is a place for small businesses and a walkable neighborhood.”

In the next several months the facade on her corner property will be improved and the plexiglass partitions on the inside will go away. It’s all part of a grand design worked out by a not-so-well-known entity called the Central Baltimore Partnership which is giving $123000 to physically improve the restaurant. The partnership works out the details of architectural design and permitting.

The Partnership also is working with the developers of the handsome restoration of the old Waverly Hall now being finished up at Greenmount Avenue and 31st Street. It also has big plans for the long closed Boulevard Theater which recently turned 100 years old. The Central Baltimore Futures Fund paid $1.2 million for the Boulevard several years ago.

The Central Baltimore Partnership uses the Muldrow Fund a commercial revitalization initiative focused on small businesses that activate long vacant spaces. Contributors to the fund include the State of Maryland and PNC Bank as well as other donors.

It’s making an impact on this part of Baltimore.

The Partnership helped the Bottoms Up Bagels shop on Greenmount near 27th and the Motzi Bread bakery at Guilford Avenue and 28th. Watch for the changes that will transform the old Hooper’s restaurant’s dining room on East 32nd Street into Red Emma’s new home.

Sometimes the changes take a different path. The partnership’s affiliate the Central Baltimore Future Fund used its money to buy out a liquor license and permanently shutter a package goods store at Guilford and Lafayette avenues in the Greenmount West community. The old shopfront was then nicely renovated.

The test will be held in conjunction with Ulster County Emergency Management.

The sirens are located in the upper portion of the waterway in the vicinity of the dam and will be audible to residents nearby and downstream along the Wallkill River and Rondout Creek. In the event of an actual emergency residents in this area should proceed immediately to higher elevations and away from the river and creek banks.

The Sturgeon Pool plant is one of the original hydroelectric facilities providing electricity to the Mid-Hudson Valley.

The facility is continuously monitored inspected regularly and has been maintained and updated since its construction.

The dam is regulated by the State Department of Environmental Conservation.

An Emergency Action Plan was developed under the auspices of the DEC by Central Hudson and local law enforcement and rescue agencies to provide a coordinated response in the unlikely event of an emergency.

This siren test is part of an annual drill of the emergency action plan. If an actual emergency were to take place the sirens would activate and residents downstream from the dam are requested to evacuate and move to higher elevations. Local emergency response personnel would provide additional instructions and assistance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2dvbGRhLXBvb2wtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzEzNDY0MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golda Pool Obituary (2021) - Anderson IN - Loose Funeral Homes & Crematory,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/golda-pool-obituary?id=31346438 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2dvbGRhLXBvb2wtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzEzNDY0MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2thcm5hdGFrYS5jb20vc3BlY2lhbC9mZWF0dXJlcy9hcGVrc2hhLWJlY29tZXMtcHJpZGUtb2YtbWx1cnUtaW4tbmF0aW9uYWwtYXF1YXRpYy1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtMjAyMS8wNzExMjAyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apeksha becomes pride of M'luru in National Aquatic Championship 2021 – News Karnataka,"Photo Credit :

16-year-old Apeksha Fernandes has won the hearts of Mangaloreans after winning 6 individual gold medals with two national records under Junior category (200 metre Individual Medley and 50 metre breast stroke) and three silver medals at the recently concluded Junior and Senior National Aquatic Championships held at Basavanagudi Aquatic Centre Bengaluru.

Apeksha has also won one silver and gold medal for team events (4x 100 metre medley relay). She bagged both the junior and senior national best swimmer trophy for 2021 under girls Group 1 and senior category for Maharashtra.

Born and brought up in Mumbai her parents B. G. Fernandes Professor at the Electrical Engineering Department at IIT and Shalet Fernandes psychologist at Dr. L H Hiranandani hospital Mumbai hail from Mangaluru. Apeksha is a student of Bunts Sangha’s S M Shetty International School and Junior College Powai. She trains at the IIT Bombay pool and the Hiranandani Forest Club under Dr. Mohan Reddy.

Apeksha Fernandes said “When I was little my mom used to take me to swim. I gained interest after joining the camp. Later my coach who was in charge of supervising the summer camps picked me up to continue my training.” She further stated that this is the first time she raced since the pandemic. We only had two to three weeks to prepare for the national finals because the pools in Maharashtra were closed for a long period of time owing to Covid. It was a little hectic for me said Apeksha.

“Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri Director IIT Bombay Deputy Director Professor Sudarshan and Additional Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai Madam Ashwini Bhide and Sir Iqbal Chahal Commissioner of Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation who played critical roles in this achievement by providing the necessary permissions and special permission to open the IIT pool for training while strictly adhering to the Covid-19 protocol” she added.

She says that racing after a very long time was memorable this time. “The credit for my achievements goes to my Coach Dr. Reddy and Ritesh” she said. Apeksha also thanked her school Principal Mildred Lobo and her team of teachers who showed their unwavering support and encouragement.

Apeksha was the Junior National Champion in the Under 14 category before the pandemic. In 2019 she represented India at the Asian age group championship where she won two bronze medals. The same year at the South Asian Games she won three gold medals and two silver medals.

She says that “It is possible to balance academics and athletics because I received a grade average of 97 per cent in my 10th despite swimming all year. I’m taking things one step at a time. Probably I’ll try for Asian games and I’d like to study side by side.”",,,,,,

Unified donated 50 books on financial literacy to the school in hopes of encouraging interest in financial awareness among students.

Buckeye South Elementary Principal Julie Packer received the books on behalf of the school and said they would be used in various ways to make the subject of money come alive for students.

According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. website “Teaching kids about money early on will help them to become more financially independent as they get older. Financial education has been linked to lower debt levels higher savings and higher credit scores as children mature into adulthood.”

Unified community development executive Don Feenerty said “Realizing that you don’t just hand money to a second-grader and expect them to understand its importance we came up with the idea of providing fun easy to understand books like ‘One Cent Two Cent Old Cent New Cent’ by Dr. Seuss and ‘Trouble With Money’ and ‘Dollars and Sense’ from the Berenstain Bears collection to schools in our area. We figured our local school teachers were the ones best qualified to teach the subject and we laid out a plan to help.”

Unified Bank based in Martins Ferry provides fiscal literacy programs for school children and adults alike. Those interested in a free group program on fiscal literacy and budgeting can contact Feenerty at dfeenerty@unifiedbank.com.

Unified also provides free financial education programming for Pre-K through 12 to teachers homeschoolers and club leaders on its website at unifiedbank.com/financial-education.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2NyYWlucy0yMDIxLW5vdGFibGUtd2VhbHRoLW1hbmFnZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crain's 2021 Notable Wealth Managers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainscleveland.com/awards/crains-2021-notable-wealth-managers on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2NyYWlucy0yMDIxLW5vdGFibGUtd2VhbHRoLW1hbmFnZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2RhbGUtdmVybm9uLW5vdGFibGUtd2VhbHRoLW1hbmFnZXJzLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dale Vernon Notable Wealth Managers 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainscleveland.com/awards/dale-vernon-notable-wealth-managers-2021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2RhbGUtdmVybm9uLW5vdGFibGUtd2VhbHRoLW1hbmFnZXJzLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

The 16-storey Class-A office tower was built in 1987. It’s LEED platinum certified and has seven elevators car-charging stations and a café.

One underground unreserved parking space is available per 1000 rentable sq ft. Highway 401 and six GO Bus routes are nearby and there is direct underground access to the Yonge-Shephard subway station.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

But They Gave Up Their Leverage. – Mother Jones,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

House progressives backed down on Friday giving President Joe Biden a chance to claim a win—even as his party’s hopes of enacting a broader agenda wobbled.

The hostage is released.

In remarks Saturday morning Biden said that the infrastructure bill will create millions of jobs. “Yesterday we took a monumental step forward as a nation” he said. “And we’re just getting started.”

Progressives permitted passage of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill without assurance that the bigger prize they have spent months holding out for—a far-reaching package of climate family and health provisions—will also become law.

The Senate passed the infrastructure bill negotiated by moderate-leaning senators in both parties in August. In the months since progressives in the House said they would only provide the votes to pass that measure as part of a deal in which Congress also approved ambitious legislation dubbed the “Build Back Better” act. That plan includes items like universal pre-school four weeks of paid and family medical leave and more than $550 billion to fight climate change paid for with a minimum tax on all corporations and increased taxes on wealthy Americans. (Allowing the federal government to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to cut drug prices is still in the mix as a possible provision in the bill.) In September progressives blocked a vote House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) attempted to hold on to the bipartisan infrastructure bill alone.

Critics accused progressives of holding the infrastructure bill hostage to their broader agenda. Now the hostage is released. The House’s 228-206 vote just before 11:30pm on Friday delinks the two bills allowing the infrastructure bill to become law and removing whatever leverage progressives gained by preventing its passage. It passed after an intense day of legislative wrangling heavy pressure from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and personal lobbying by Biden.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus told reporters that the president even called her mother in India after successfully pushing for Jayapal and members of her caucus to support the infrastructure bill. Jayapal said her mother told her that she “just kept screaming like a little girl.” (Jayapal didn’t offer many details but her mother seems to have been excited to hear from the president.)

Democratic leaders had hoped on Friday to vote on and pass both bills. But a group of moderate Democrats announced they would oppose the Build Back Better measure because the Congressional Budget Office had not yet assessed if the bill fulfills Democrats’ promise to offset all new spending with increased revenue.

Pelosi left a procedural vote open all day allowing it to become the longest recorded House vote in modern history while negotiating to resolve the impasse. Eventually five of the moderates pledged in a notably qualified letter that they would “commit to voting for the Build Back Better Act in its current form other than technical changes as expeditiously as we receive fiscal information from the Congressional Budget Office—but in no event later than the week of November 15.”

It was the longest recorded House vote in modern history.

Pelosi also held a procedural vote to start consideration of the broader act another gesture aimed at assuring progressives that the bill will get a vote. Biden Pelosi and Democrats involved in talks said they agreed to trust each other.

This worked. Only six progressive members of the so-called Squad voted against the infrastructure bill. “This is bullshit” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said before opposing the bill. But Jayapal and other progressives backed the measure. Pelosi offset Democratic defections with support from 13 Republicans.

The vote was an embarrassment for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) who tried to unify his members against the bill and predicted it would fail. And it enraged some of the House’s most vocal conservatives.

I can’t believe Republicans just gave the Democrats their socialism bill. — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) November 6 2021

Democrats rattled by a decline in Biden’s approval and defeat in Virginia’s gubernatorial race last week greeted the bill’s passage late Friday night with sustained cheers.

“The one message that came across was ‘get something done'” Biden said Saturday when asked about the election results.

But the bill’s passage leaves most of Biden’s agenda unfulfilled. The bill includes $550 billion in new funds over 10 years for highways and bridges expansion of broadband for internet access and modernizing the power grid. But nearly half the bill’s cost is for renewing existing transportation spending and it is far smaller than the $2.6 trillion plan that Biden initially proposed leaving out $363 billion in proposed tax credits for renewable energy among other things.

Progressives have no assurance that the Build Back Better Act will pass Congress. Nor do they have power to change that. Even if House moderates honor their pledges that only means the measure will pass in the House. In the Senate Democrats will try to pass the bill under budget rules that allow passage with a bare majority preventing Republicans from blocking it by filibustering. That means Democrats need every one of their senators to vote for it a circumstance that empowers members whose votes are not assured prominently Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) to sink it or dictate its content. If they pass the measure at all senators are expected to alter whatever the House approves sending it back to the lower chamber for another vote.

In prepared remarks Saturday Biden said flatly that Build Back Better will pass in the House and the Senate. But in a question and answer session he was more measured. “We’re gonna see what happens in the Senate” he said. “And whether or not I need only Democratic votes which is likely and whether I can get all of them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RoZS1uYmEtaXNudC1uZWFybHktYXMtcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtYXMtaXQtdGhpbmtzLWl0LWlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The NBA Isn't Nearly as Progressive as It Thinks It Is,"Things got dicey for Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver real quick. In a recent investigation by ESPN’s Baxter Holmes the longtime reporter interviewed over seventy Suns employees past and present the vast majority of whom described Sarver as “brutal to work for.” They say Sarver sat at the center of a racist misogynistic and domineering atmosphere where toxicity stretched across almost every department. Former coaches Earl Watson and Corliss Williamson spoke on the record about several social interactions that set their racist alarms off—from something as prickly as “They can say n****r why can’t I?” arguments to Watson allegedly being fired because he’s a Klutch Sports client.

The article further details wild allegations like Sarver passing around scantily-clad photos of his own wife to his employees who bounced it around “like a hot potato” and his decision to hire Lindsey Hunter the obviously under-experienced developmental coach as head coach over Dan Majerle in 2013 because according to the report “These n*****s need n*****s.” He offered a similar racial rationale when hiring Earl Watson in 2017: “A young Black coach could better relate to Black players… and could speak their language” one former Suns executive said. Yikes. An oddly-precise instance where the flimsiness of diversity and inclusion is laid bare. Here’s an owner who is so racist that he’ll hire the Black guys even the woefully inexperienced ones simply because they can “speak their language” or whatever. But the most fascinating part of this story —although asking Blake Griffin’s older brother if he shaved his balls was quite the surprise—was a small quote from one Suns co-owner who said “The level of misogyny and racism is beyond the pale. It’s embarrassing as an owner.”

Clearly this isn’t a good look at all for the Suns and the league—though let’s not get it twisted: if we’re looking squarely at the makeup of the NBA’s billionaire owners the league is nowhere near a bastion of progressive freedom. To be a billionaire at all mandates a willingness to exploit people and rationalize it however one sees fit. But the quote from the co-owner might reveal Sarver’s bigger problem: it doesn’t seem like other owners like him which according to precedent was one of the main reasons why Donald Sterling lost his grip on the LA Clippers’ organization after 30-plus years of demonstrably racist sexist and downright creepiness. V. Stiviano dropped the hottest recorded phone call of the 2010s and the owners decided he’ll have to hate from outside the club. If Sarver loses his team at the end of all of this I doubt it will be by the league’s hand as much as his being a racist sexist asshole who also happens to be loud.

There are likely other owners who share Sarver’s views on race and gender. As a Houstonian I’ve had to take some time away from the timebomb that is Tilman Fertitta’s tenure as Rockets owner. Fertitta is a staunch supporter of the former pumpkin-in-chief—he donated $140000 to his re-election campaign and during the pandemic he tried to slash employee benefits at the popular Post Oak Hotel in Houston but when public backlash forced him into reneging he furloughed a total of 40000 employees where a whopping 70% of their staff had been laid off. James Harden and Russell Westbrook reportedly wanting out of Houston over Fertitta’s Trump ties be damned—40000 people lost their jobs across Fertitta’s casinos and restaurants.

If we’re thinking politically where billionaire ownership places their dollars reveals more than any BLM logos on a basketball court ever could. According to an extensive report by John Gonzalez of The Ringer 80.9 percent of political donations by NBA owners have gone to Republicans and their interests. Five owners have donated to Trump directly including Fertitta the LA Lakers’ Jim Buss New York Knicks’ James Dolan Orlando Magic’s Dan DeVos and San Antonio Spurs’ Julianna Holt. Cavs owner Dan Gilbert gave $750000 just to inaugurate him. Sarver threw in a cool $179400 to the cause himself.

I’m always curious about the expanse of racism and white supremacist notions among the NBA Board of Governors. So much ink has been spilled about the Player Empowerment Movement. But platforms do not equate to actual power. These players use basketball as a platform to do whatever: express themselves sell merch talk shit snag endorsements etc. But none of that means having influence—not when a large source of income joy and fulfillment is found beneath an oligarchical system that exploits them and believes that working with them means complete control of one’s autonomy. Sarver said the quiet part out loud: “Do I own you?” he asked a horrified female employee “Are you one of mine?”

“ Sarver said the quiet part out loud: “Do I own you?” he asked a horrified female employee “Are you one of mine?” ”

We don’t have to think of this in entirely political terms either. The Dallas Mavericks—whose owner Mark Cuban is said to be an “independent” who goes to conservative guys like Steve Bannon for advice and the liberal guys to solicit the latest socially acceptable positions on topics like race and sex—were under intense scrutiny for similar issues in 2018. Back then dozens of employees came forward to Sports Illustrated and spoke up about the sexual harassment domestic violence and intimidation that had become the norm at the Mavs. Although Cuban pleaded ignorance to the terrible culture as an owner who prides himself in being all-in on the Mavs into all the weeds we’re supposed to believe that he somehow missed the countless complaints against multiple creeps in his offices. And the consequences were minimal. They just had to fire some folks hire some other folks and we’ve pretty much forgotten about that.

Oh and lest we forget the Golden State Warriors’ billionaire VC co-owner who took it upon himself to shove then-Raptors star Kyle Lowry after he tumbled into the stands. He was only suspended for a playoff series.

It’s easy to forget all this ugliness when the NBA media is so focused on either the game at hand the latest trade move or probing players for their takes on the latest social issue. No one places a microphone in front of Tilman Fertitta and asks him about the 70% of his staff who have to look for work during a pandemic. The owners are never taken to task for say the years of racist housing practices perpetrated by Donald Sterling or the ways Dan Gilbert’s company Quicken Loans engaged in predatory lending in order to lock in loans for people who would never be able to pay them back after interest. That federal lawsuit cost Gilbert $32.5 million to settle. But then we want to act shocked when the Baxter Holmes’ of the world bomb the shell and bring all this to light. Sarver’s “warning signs” had been there since 2004. Though these fantastic investigations are helpful they are also spectacular. They’re unique and treated as such by the owners themselves. Sarver isn’t quiet therefore he’s a league liability — one that could further expose more of the owners’ beliefs and practices. So in their eyes maybe cutting him loose isn’t the worst thing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1kZXNpZ25lcnMtd2luLWNhc2gtcHJpemVzLWF0LXByb2dyZXNzaXZlLXRhaWxvcnMtY2x1Yi1wcmVtaWVyZS_SAV9odHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24tZGVzaWduZXJzLXdpbi1jYXNoLXByaXplcy1hdC1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS10YWlsb3JzLWNsdWItcHJlbWllcmUvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fashion designers win cash prizes at Progressive Tailors Club premiere,"A new movie The Progressive Tailors Club was recently premiered at the Filmhouse Cinemas IMAX Lekki Lagos in atmosphere of conviviality and undiluted entertainment.

The event was sponsored by the Bigi soft drink brand produced by Rite Foods which has consistently demonstrated its support for the growth of the Nigerian movie industry.

The highlight of the premiere was a fashion competition organised by Bigi for 20 shortlisted fashion designers across the country who had participated in an online campaign to showcase their creativity.

Three winners eventually emerged from the contest and they include Debbie Kouture from Ekiti State who clinched the first prize of N150000; while The Daiamen and Lamoimee both from Lagos emerged second and third with N100000 and N50000 respectively.

The movie’s producer Niyi Akinmolayan commended the sponsor of the premiere and expressed confidence that the film would be enjoyed by movie lovers. Speaking about the movie he stated that the film is built around the nature of Nigerians but from tailors’ perspectives as they come up with different characters which are sometimes funny and provocative.

In her remark the Bigi’s Brand Manager Boluwatife Adedugbe stated that the company was committed to promoting Nigerian talents in entertainment special skills and ‘ideapreneurship’.

She noted that the movie industry contributes massively to the country’s gross domestic product and should be assisted to create more revenue for young Nigerians attracted to it.",,,,,,

The DFSA confirmed in a statement that it has also banned Wadood from conducting any financial services-related business

Former Abraaj managing partners Sivendran Vettivetpillai (left) and Mustafa Abdel-Wadood.

LONDON: The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has imposed a fine of $1.9 million on former Abraaj managing partner Mustafa Abdel-Wadood for breaching its rules and deceiving investors while working for the multi-million dollars equity firm.

The DFSA confirmed in a statement that it has also banned Wadood from conducting any financial services-related business in or from the Dubai International Financial Centre.

Abdel-Wadood is out on a $10m bail in New York as he awaits sentencing. Nearly three years ago he was arrested and put on bail as he was visiting New York to look for a college where he could get his son admitted. At the same time Arif Naqvi the Abraaj founder was arrested in London. Arif Naqvi is on a £15 million bail and lives with his family in Knightsbridge while he fights the US bid to extradite him.

He has denied each and every allegation levelled by the US authorities against him.



The Dubai authorities sanctioned Mustafa Abdel-Wadood a few weeks after another former Abraaj managing partner Sivendran Vettivetpillai pleaded guilty to nine counts of criminal activities said to have been committed between 2014 and 2018 that could carry a total of 115 years in jail and a fine of up to $11.5 million.

Sri Lankan born and British national Sivendran Vettivetpillai – also known as Sev Vettivetpillai - pleaded guilty from the UK via a remote hearing before Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn at the US District Court Southern District of New York.

""The DFSA has taken enforcement action against Abdel-Wadood for his involvement in breaches of DIFC legislation by Abraaj Investment Management Limited (AIML) a Cayman entity not authorised by the DFSA. AIML carried out unauthorised financial service activities in or from the DIFC and actively misled and deceived investors in Abraaj funds"" the regulator said.

A New York court postponed the sentencing of Abdel-Wadood last year at the request of the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York pending the outcome of a request for the extradition of the company’s founder Arif Naqvi.

The Westminster Magistrates’ Court had last year ordered the extradition of Arif Naqvi to the US but the Pakistani national has appealed the ruling and plans to take the matter to superior English court within a few days.

Abdel-Wadood is one of six former Abraaj executives facing extortion and securities fraud charges following an investigation by New York prosecutors into the collapse of what was once the largest private equity firm in the Middle East.

Abdel-Wadood pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and agreed in June 2019 to co-operate with the US inquiry into a fundraising scheme that helped lead to Abraaj's collapse.

As ACLD CEO Abdel-Wadood had significant responsibility for ACLD’s activities but ""he failed to take reasonable care to ensure that ACLD complied with legislation applicable in the DIFC"" the DFSA said.

Abdel-Wadood ""failed to identify that ACLD’s prudential returns and financial statements which he signed contained false and misleading information. He took no steps to stop ACLD resources from being used by AIML to conduct unauthorised activity in or from the DIFC"" it added.

The fine imposed ""reflects the seriousness of the offences"" and is based on Abdel-Wadood’s earnings from the Abraaj Group the DFSA said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Evergreen Devco which has several commercial projects in various stages in the Pikes Peak region plans to build a 300-unit apartment project on the Sears property to be called Overlook Briargate.

The company announced its plans in 2020 and finalized its purchase of the Sears property in May. A few months later it began an interior demolition of the former Sears store. Now it's in the midst of razing the building itself which was constructed 40 years ago.

The company expects to complete the demolition in mid to late December said Robert Place Evergreen Devco's multifamily development director for Colorado. Apartment building construction should begin one to two months after demolition is complete he said.

The first apartments are expected to open in 2023.

""I can imagine to longtime residents a landmark is disappearing"" Place said. ""But I certainly hope that everyone's pleased with the product we're putting up there. I really feel like it's going to rejuvenate a lot of the other retailers at the (mall).""

Financially troubled Sears closed its Chapel Hills Mall store and another at the Broadmoor Towne Center on the city's south side in March 2019.

• YMCA still looks to the future. In December 2019 the YMCA of the Pikes Peak Region announced plans to build a new downtown recreation and wellness center.

The project — complicated and the largest the organization has ever undertaken — was delayed about six to nine months because of the COVID-19 pandemic said Boyd Williams the YMCA's president and CEO.

Still the nonprofit is moving ahead with the project albeit with changes he said.

As envisioned two years ago a new three-story YMCA building would be constructed on the northwest corner of a block bounded by Nevada and Platte avenues and Bijou and Weber streets Williams said. The YMCA owns the site and other portions of the block.

Also as announced in 2019 the new building would be topped by several stories of apartments that would serve as workforce housing — less expensive units for teachers public safety workers and others who can't afford high-end properties.

The YMCA expects construction to begin in the second quarter of 2022 with a ribbon cutting about 20 months later Williams said. That puts the opening in late 2023 or early 2024.

The YMCA's existing building would remain open to members during construction but then would be torn down and the site redeveloped with still-to-be-determined new uses he said.

Among project changes the YMCA no longer is partnering with developer White Lotus Group of Omaha Neb. Williams said.

Instead the YMCA has joined with Scott Henry a former White Lotus executive. Henry is a co-founder of Celadon Partners of Chicago an affordable housing developer according to the company's website.

When he was with White Lotus Henry essentially was ""the mastermind"" behind the original YMCA project concept and the organization chose to stay with him when he went to Celadon Williams said.

Also while the YMCA and White Lotus two years ago envisioned commercial buildings of 82000 square feet and 37000 square feet elsewhere on the block Williams said it's now premature to say what else the organization's project will include beyond its new building and the workforce housing component.

""Things are changed"" Williams said. ""Now we're with Celadon. So they're going to identify what other priorities for this community are needed that would supplement this project with the next phase. At this point that has not been determined.""

• What about Whataburger? The Texas hamburger favorite with a loyal following has announced it's coming to Colorado Springs but its fans might have to wait a little longer to enjoy the chain's made-to-order burgers and other menu fare.

The area's first Whataburger is under construction in the InterQuest Marketplace shopping center northeast of Interstate 25 and InterQuest Parkway on the city's far north side. It will be a short drive from the area's first In-N-Out Burger the California chain with a following of its own which opened southeast of InterQuest and Voyager parkways.

During a groundbreaking in August BurgerWorks Colorado the Texas franchisee that's bringing Whataburger to town said it expected to open the restaurant by the end of 2021.

But a spokeswoman for Whataburger's corporate office now says via email that the restaurant won't open until early 2022; no specific date was available. The spokeswoman gave no reason for the timetable change for the restaurant's opening.

Robert Garcia a vice president with Nor'wood Development Group in Colorado Springs and developer of InterQuest Marketplace said he's been told Whataburger might open in February.

• American Furniture Warehouse eyes Powers Boulevard. The suburban Denver furniture giant one of the state's largest furniture retailers said this year it would build a 355000-square-foot showroom and warehouse on 25 acres southeast of Powers Boulevard and Woodmen Road on Colorado Springs' fast-growing northeast side.

The new location would be in addition to the 145000-square-foot American Furniture Warehouse showroom and warehouse that opened in 1999 west of Interstate 25 and Fillmore Street in northwest Colorado Springs.

Initially construction was envisioned to begin on the new Powers Boulevard location this fall with a completion in fall 2022.

But Nolan Morrison who heads real estate development for American Furniture Warehouse said the project was delayed because of soaring construction material costs. That problem resulted from a pandemic-related slowdown or stoppage in the operation of lumber mills manufacturing plants and other producers of materials used in construction builders and general contractors have said.

""Construction materials just got to an all-time high"" Morrison said. ""It didn't make sense to build at the all-time high. By not building on this (original) schedule we can probably save quite a bit of money.""

American Furniture Warehouse now will look to start construction of its second location in fall 2022 and open probably in late 2023 Morrison said.

""We can't wait"" he said.

• New development at busy Academy Boulevard corner. The southwest corner of Academy Boulevard and Galley Road on Colorado Springs' east side is going through a major change that will bring a national fast-casual restaurant to the site.

Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers the Louisiana-based chain will build its fourth Springs restaurant at Academy and Galley and last month completed a $2.2 million purchase of a nearly 1-acre parcel at the corner.

Patrick Kerscher a vice president in the Colorado Springs office of national real estate firm CBRE said Raising Cane's is expected to start construction shortly on its new restaurant though an opening date isn't known. Kerscher represented property owner Dunton Commercial of Denver in the sale of the property to Raising Cane's.

In addition a national convenience store chain plans to lease a parcel to the south of Raising Cane's where it will build a location Kerscher said.

The convenience store chain and Raising Cane's whose first Springs restaurant opened in 2019 will join In Self Storage a Denver self-storage company that last year paid $1.5 million to purchase the nearby former Toys R Us building. In Self Storage remodeled the building and has opened a storage facility at the site..

""The traffic counts along Academy and Galley are very strong"" he said. ""The density of rooftops (in the area) is very appealing to retailers that require high volumes of customers per day.""

The Academy-and-Galley corner became especially attractive after Colorado Springs city officials OK'd traffic upgrades in the area Kerscher said.

A new right-in right-out turn lane will allow access to the site from eastbound Galley he said. At the same time a left turn lane was added to allow traffic to access the site from northbound Academy.

""That changed the site from a destination retail user in Toys R Us to something that now can be convenient for fast food and fuel convenience-type users"" Kerscher said. ""That was the game changer on the site the increased access there that was permitted by the city.""

• More chicken on the way. Two national brands that specialize in chicken are moving ahead with expansion plans in Colorado Springs. A third however is still trying to scratch its way into the market.

Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A is proceeding with regulatory and construction approvals for the chain's planned demolition of a retail building on the south end of the Citadel Crossing shopping center northeast of Academy Boulevard and Platte Avenue said Dan Rodriguez a vice president with the local office of CBRE a national real estate firm.

The Casual Male XL clothing store the last remaining retailer in the building has closed Rodriguez said. The retailer no longer has a store in the Springs according to the chain's website. A Comfort Dental dental office which also occupied the building has moved elsewhere in Citadel Crossing.

In place of the retail building Chick-fil-A will construct a new restaurant according to plans the chain submitted this year to Colorado Springs city officials. The chain will own the building but lease the ground underneath according to Citadel Crossing developer Patrick Nesbitt.

Rodriguez said he doesn't know a timetable for the building's demolition and new construction.

Whenever Chick-fil-A opens Rodriguez said he expects it to do big business because of the location's visibility along Academy and Platte and access to the shopping center.

""I think it's going to be a monster"" Rodriguez said.

The chain had been looking at a handful of locations in the area for several years before it decided on Citadel Crossing he said. Chick-fil-A also had closed its food court location this year at the nearby Citadel mall.

Meanwhile Buffalo Wild Wings also based in Atlanta is continuing with plans for a new restaurant and sports bar as part of the First & Main Town Center in an area of the shopping center southeast of Powers Boulevard and South Carefree Circle.

Buffalo Wild Wings had submitted a proposal to city planning officials in January 2020 that showed it would raze a former Mimi's restaurant at the site and construct a new building in its place.

The project was delayed however because of the COVID-19 pandemic said Garcia of Nor'wood Development Group which built First & Main the sprawling east-side retail complex with dozens of restaurants big-box retailers smaller stores and entertainment venues.

Nor'wood demolished the Mimi's building two months ago and Buffalo Wild Wings now hopes to break ground on its restaurant this month Garcia said. An opening likely would follow in 2022.

Buffalo Wild Wings officials didn't respond to requests for comment.

""It's definitely a positive"" Garcia said of Buffalo Wild Wing's addition at First & Main. ""They're a use that is unique to First & Main being wings and kind of a sports atmosphere. We're excited about having that open up. It's a nice complement.""

Another chicken concept California-based El Pollo Loco announced in February that it would expand to the Colorado Springs and Denver markets with as many as 20 franchised locations over the next five years.

At the time of its announcement El Pollo Loco didn't have any franchisees inked and had no locations.

Last month El Pollo Loco said it has signed two franchisees in Denver one of which would develop four restaurants on the city's east side and the other that would open four locations on its west side.

But residents of the Pikes Peak region will have to head north if they want El Pollo Loco chicken; the chain still hasn't found a franchisee for Colorado Springs.

“Having recently signed two separate agreements for eight total restaurants in Denver we're continuing to speak with prospective franchise partners to help expand our footprint into Colorado Springs as well"" Brian Carmichall El Pollo Loco’s chief development officer said via email.

• Homes coming to the former Springs Ranch Golf Club. Colorado Springs-based Classic Cos. one of the city's largest real estate developers and homebuilders has launched development of the Greenways at Sand Creek on the site of the former 200-acre Springs Ranch Golf Club on the city's east side. The housing project site runs east of Tutt Boulevard between South and North Carefree circles with a portion extending north of North Carefree.

Classic proposed the Greenways at Sand Creek in 2019 after Springs Ranch Golf Club's former owner sought to retire and get out from what he said was a golf course with dwindling player interest and high maintenance costs.

Classic's proposal to redevelop the golf course with upward of 900 single-family homes townhomes and condominiums received the city's OK in 2020 which followed opposition from many nearby residents. A Dallas real estate company also plans a 330-unit apartment complex on the south end of the Greenways at Sand Creek site.

To prepare the property for residential development Classic this year demolished a clubhouse on the property. It also renovated and remodeled a former golf course maintenance facility that will house a new home sales center and construction operations for the Greenways project.

Home sales recently began for an initial 40-acre portion of the Greenways at Sand Creek which is being developed north of North Carefree Circle. The area will be developed with 121 single-family ranch-style homes; no two-story homes will be permitted in the initial area being developed as part of a commitment that Classic made to nearby residents.",,,,,,,,,,,,

QCOM,Qualcomm,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS90aGVfc25hcGRyYWdvbl84OThfd2lsbF9wcm9iYWJseV9iZV91bnZlaWxlZF9vbl9ub3ZlbWJlcl8zMC1uZXdzLTUxNzM0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Snapdragon 898 will probably be unveiled on November 30,"Nothing is official or set in stone yet you it's a fair assumption to make. Qualcomm recently published a page on its website revealing that its Tech Summit event will be held between November 30 and December 2 2021. A big banner with a boat tracing an infinity sign in the water and a ""More to come soon!"" text - that's about it. No extra info no itinerary no nothing as of writing this article.

Still putting two and two together rumors of the next flagship Snapdragon 898 have been floating around for some time now. In fact some sources claim that the first phone to use the chipset will be the Xiaomi 12 and that it will launch by the end of the year. Seeing how keynotes typically take place on the first day of a convention it is safe to assume that the Snapdragon 898 will be detailed on November 30 or failing that no later than December 2.

Thanks to quite a few leaks even including one of an actual unknown device running the Qualcomm SM8450 chipset otherwise known as the Snapdragon 898 we do already have a pretty good idea of its specs. It is expected to have a prime AMR Cortex-X2 CPU core - running at 3.0 GHz alongside three Cortex-A710 based mid-cores clocked at 2.5 GHz and finally four efficient Cortex-A510 derived cores at 1.79 GHz.

The GPU is said to be an Adreno 730 which between architectural improvements over the Adreno 660 and Samsung's 4nm manufacturing process might bring up to 20% performance improvement to the table. For connectivity we expect an X65 5G modem with a theoretical maximum downlink speed of 10Gbps.

There are some key features that really make this the best e-note that money can buy. It is utilizing one of the latest generation Qualcomm Snapdragon processor 6GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage so you can sideload in tons of content. It is running Google Android 11 and has full access to the Play Store so millions of free and paid apps are available. The Lumi 2 really shines when used to draw and edit PDF files and ebooks. Onyx has one of the best drawing apps in the business that is more advanced than Remarkable.

Hardware

The Max Lumi 2 features a 13.3 inch E INK Carta 1250 and Mobius display with a resolution of 2200×1650 with 207 PPI. The screen is completely flush with the bezel and there is a protective layer of PMMA glass substrate that is made of acrylic. You will be able to read at night with the front-lit display via the white LED lights and it also has a series of amber LED lights to provide a warm candlelight effect.

There are very few E INK devices on the market that are using the new Carta 1250 display. The technology took three years of development and was only released in February. It provides e-notes with a higher higher contrast ratio. It also leverages the same updates from Carta 1200 which is a faster ink enabling faster page turns and faster pen input which reduces latency. Overall performance has been increased across the board by about 20%.

The primary reason why 13.3 inch e-notes cost a lot is because there really isn’t that many that are being made anymore. The chief benefit of buying this model is the support for A4 documents. A4 is a paper size that is used for a wide range of documents including magazines catalogs letters and forms. A4 measures 210 × 297 millimeters or 8.27 × 11.69 inches. In PostScript its dimensions are rounded off to 595 × 842 points. It is basically the same size as a standard 8.5/11 piece of paper which means it will read PDF files natively without having to pinch and zoom. This is also the ideal screen for replica newspapers and also digital comics.

Onyx has developed a new stylus for their latest generation hardware. It has an improved nib which renders a close-to-paper writing experience. Ergonomic shaft with grooves can help you grip firmly. This pen is magnetic and can attach itself to the side of the Note 5 and Note Air 2 but does not attach itself to the side of the Max Lumi 2. The nibs don’t need to replaced as often which should save some money. The new stylus was developed in conjunction with the new writing film that is installed at the factory level. It is designed to provide some friction when writing on the display. The only other company that did something similar is Supernote but their film depth is larger than Onyx which means you will not be able to use ceramic nibs on the Lumi display.

Underneath the hood is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 octo-core CPU with 6GB of RAM. There is 128GB of internal storage which should be enough for your PDF and ebook collection. There is no SD card to expand the storage further but it does have access to the Onyx Boox Cloud. There are two stereo speakers on the back of the device that are positioned near the bottom. This does not muffle sound as much as I would have thought. This provides a clear avenue to listen to audiobooks music or podcasts without having to utilize Bluetooth for wireless headphones or speakers. It also has USB-C OTG so it can also support not only headphones but also wireless accessories such as keyboards or page turn buttons. Next to the USB port is a small microphone this was put there to take advantage of the voice to text system in the Onyx drawing app where you can make audio dictations and will convert it to text. It also works for voice communication apps such as Discord Whatsapp Facebook message or iMessage. The dimensions are 310 × 228 × 7.9 mm and weighs 570g.

The Lumi 2 is powered by a 4300 mAh battery which should provide a couple of weeks of constant usage. There is a fingerprint scanner to unlock your device which should help with unauthorized access. One of the downsides of this generation is the lack of an HDMI port this is something that has bene a staple of the MAX franchise since the Max and then carried over to the MAX Carta Max 2 Max 3 and Lumi 1. I believe that Onyx decided to forgo this port because they recently released the Mira and Mira Pro dedicated E INK monitors and they did not want e-notes to compete against them and canalize their own products. However Onyx told me that you can use software for Android PC or MAC for the Lumi 2 to be used wirelessly as a secondary monitor but nothing beats a dedicated HDMI port for better communication protocols.

When buy buy the Onyx Boox Max Lumi 2 for the first time and take it out of the shipping box you will be greeted by the retail packaging. The color scheme is black on the front and sides and has a big picture of the Lumi. On the back there is a white color scheme and lists a bunch of tech specs written in like 8 different languages it provides the full breakdown on all of the key selling features. This is something that most e-reader brands don’t do. Amazon for example never writes about what processor they are using or how much RAM a Kindle has they say things like “battery lasts for 10 weeks.” I have often found that the bigger the company the more marketing speak you get whereas Onyx really hypes up exact hardware specs.

Design wise the Lumi 2 is a black writing slate there is no gradient color scheme instead it is mostly piano black. This emphasis the grey screen and the bezels melt away when staring at the screen for a few minutes. This is why most e-readers are using black bezels or completely black designs. There is nothing very flashy about the Lumi 2 but that’s ok everything is basically about the drawing experience writing editing PDF files etc.

Software

Onyx is heavily invested in the Google Android ecosystem for all of their devices and each major product release often provides a new version giving users not only a modern OS but all of the benefits including security. The Lumi 2 is running Android 11 and has full access to the Google Play Store and they are the only brand besides Boyue to include this for their users. Onyx runs a custom Kernel called Boox OS which provides a ton of benefits and software enhancements. In this release they improved the Neoreader ebook reading software. The document layout engine now has better support for faster page turns for sideloaded EPUB/TXT/DOC/DOCX files. They have also introduced a new feature called Boox Drop which makes it easy to transfer ebooks and notes from the device to your PC and from your PC to your Boox device.

The note taking app also has some new improvements which helps make it a better creative tool. There is customized pen brush slot which you can establish your own pen layout and save it to the toolbar. There is also vector export after you finish drawing you can export it as a vector quality layout for further editing on your PC with professional design software. Onyx Boox has made some software optimizations to some third party drawing apps. They have reduced the latency and improved stylus interactions with Onenote Evernote and WPS which now make them an extremely viable alternative to Onyx’s own drawing app. This is sort of what they did with the Kindle app a couple of years ago where they eliminated the animated page turns making it easier to use the app. The 3.2 update is available not only the Lumi 2 but also Note 5 and Note Air 2. Onyx told me that they will be porting this over to their previous generation sometime in November.

The home screen is likely going to be the first thing that you see and where you will spend most of your time. The UI is based on the sidebar and has icons that link to the bookstore library notes storage apps and settings. On the settings menu there is a notification to signup for the Onyx Boox Account login which provides 5GB of notes sync and cloud services also it lists the serial number mac address and what firmware it is running on. You can configure all sorts of options here including Bluetooth devices and WIFI networks. Although this has a fingerprint scanner you can also establish a password to lock or unlock it and also run calibration and gesture processes.

The library is your default screen it basically lists all of the content on your device if you just bought it this will be blank unless you download content from the Boox Store or sideload in your own content. You can sort books by format author date and browse by list view or image view. The Store is primarily populated with royalty free books such as the ones you would find on Project Gutenberg they are all free and don’t cost any money.

Onyx runs their own app store but it is barebones and they only have 48 apps to download. Although they do provide enough to get you started. They have Kindle KOREADER Overdrive Libby VIZ Manga and a bunch of others in the News Study Tools and Work categories. You will likely want to get Google Play to access a a wide variety of others but it is not installed by default. You have to do a bunch of things in the settings menu and then reboot your device we have a video tutorial that walks you through this entire process. Notes leads you to the note taking experience and files is basically just a file manager app.

If you drag your finger down from the top center of the screen or simply tap it there is a dropdown menu that appears. This is quickly where you can establish a WIFI or Bluetooth connections lock the orientation to landscape or portrait mode or adjust the front-light or color temperature system via slider bars. Next to that is a volume slider. There are all sorts of icons here to launch Miracast or a recording feature that will record anything you do on the screen or initiate split screen view.

There is a brand new option on the Lumi 2 that it is not available on any other model. This is called E INK Center and it provides a number of advanced customizations. Dark color enhancement which makes all of the blacks lighter or darker depending on how you want your device to look. Light Color Enhancement basically emphasizes all of the greyscale whether you want this lighter or darker. You can think of these as global contrast settings some users will really want to tweak these settings to get your ideal screen layout. E INK Center also provides quick access to the speed mode system such as Normal Mode which is the default. Speed Mode which slightly degrades image quality and increases performance. A2 mode is typical for almost all e-readers and tablets. X-Mode is something very compelling this is where you can actually do some light gaming and watching YouTube videos although they still have framerate issues. I found that X-Mode is ideal for streaming music podcasts or audiobooks from dedicated apps like Spotify.

Persistently all over every screen menu and UI element is a floating ball. This provides quick access to core functionality and you can drag/position it wherever you want it on the screen. There are default things but you can add in your own or disable it altogether. All of the settings on this ball are really redundant and I disable it as soon as possible. This is because there is text next to the entries and it is really hard to read even on a 13.3 inch display.

On a pure software level Onyx provides something that few in the e-reader and e-note industry can match. They always push out firmware updates to solve existing bugs and introduce new features. Each new generation has a new version of Boox OS which has things not found on any other device likely they do this to encourage people to upgrade to the latest and greatest although over time they do push it out to older devices. I think overall Google Play is a huge benefit which should provide enough of an incentive for people to switch to Onyx instead of going with a Supernote or Remarkable which do similar things but they are basically locked down ecosystems whereas Onyx is more fluid.

Note Taking

Drawing is really where the Lumi 2 Shines and it all starts with the Note taking app. It has two main UI bars one on the side and one at the top. The top bar is where you are going to make adjustments on what type of writing utensil you wish to employ. Options include: brush pencil pen ballpoint ben and highlighter. Each one has 16 different shades including very dark and ranges to very light. Although this is not a color e-note it does have red green and blue which are only seen in color when the note is exported as a PNG or PDF file. You can create multiple pen templates on the UI and quickly switch between them. For example you could have a pen with black lines and create a pencil with light lines and just click between them you can basically create 5 total.

Not matter what writing tool you are going to be selecting the Boox Pen Plus has 4096 degrees of pressure sensitivity which is fairly standard. The harder you press the thicker the lines become. This is great tool for not only the average user but also graphics character or environmental artists.

The side bar can quickly become overwhelming with the sheer number of options. For example you can click on the lines icon and do 8 different lines in addition to 6 geometric shapes which can be imported into the document and resized. There are also various eraser functions which is useful because the stock pen does not have an eraser button. There are lasso tools text AI (speech to text or handwriting to text) You can import in image files do a full page refresh and tons of other things. You can actually configure the toolbar with things you use often and remove less often features.

One of the best features is the layering system. You can create 5 total layers which is really useful if you are drawing with fine detail. Layer 1 can be a house Layer 2 can be the hill layer 3 can the sky layer 5 can be fine details and you can edit/erase/import things into each layer. This also ensures that you can get very detailed on what you want to do this is very similar to Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator.

Notes also play a strong element in side by side view or split screen view. You can decide what you want on one side of the screen such as a PDF file app web browser or anything else and have the note taking on the other side so you can take notes or make references. You can also have 2 PDF Files side by side or even two apps. I like being able to have 1 PDF open in two page spread in landscape mode and being able to edit that PDF file with all of the drawing options.

Speaking of PDF files if you are using the stock Neoreader there are all sorts of options to make them look really good. You can embolden sharpen image bleach a watermark dark color enhancement change the contrast split screen view access the table of contents or just jump to another page. It also has an OCR mode which is excellent.

We will be doing an advanced note taking video and embedding it into this review when we are done this should take a couple of weeks although our review video at the end of this post should provide everything you need to understand all of the core functionality. I really think that the Lumi 2 is one of the best e-notes in the world in terms of options you can access for ebooks PDF files and for drawing. Things can sometimes get overwhelming if you have never had an e-note before or are switching brands but there are a enough advanced options to really take customizations to a new level.

Wrap Up

The Onyx Boox Max Lumi 2 is the most powerful e-note in the world and nothing else comes close. From the processor to the RAM to the internal storage there is enough to handle the most demanding tasks. Access to the Play Store cannot be understated there are virtually no other e-notes out there that have it and this has built a very strong loyalty to the Boox brand as a whole.

Should you buy the Onyx Boox Max Lumi 2? There are some compelling reasons. There is basically only one other 13.3 inch on the market the Fujitsu Quaderno A4 which is very good in its own right but does not have all of the advanced features as the Lumi 2 but this is a good thing it is more accessible to the average user and for businesses who want to replace paper in their office. It offers very similar features to the discontinued Sony Digital Paper. On the download with the global EPD and chip shortages the Quaderno is in short supply but things should get better in December or January.

The Lumi 2 is a good upgrade if you have an older MAX such as the 2 or 3. If you are a LUMI 1 user there might not be enough reasons to spent almost $900 for more RAM faster Snapdragon processor more storage and a higher version of Android well actually I would recommend that too!

If you are looking for a solid e-note that is geared towards A4 documents there is nothing more customizable or advanced as the Lumi 2. If you buy it from Good e-Reader you get a free case and stylus. It “>retails for $879.99 from the Good e-Reader Store.

It is expected to power Android smartphones in 2022 and we just learned which manufacturer might be the first to market their handsets powered by these new ultra powerful chips.

The Xiaomi 12 series has been the talk of the town for several days. Features and designs of the upcoming Xiaomi 12 have already surfaced online. Now the latest development has confirmed the Xiaomi 12 will be the first phone with the Snapdragon 898 chipset. Popular Chinese tipster Digital Chat Station has claimed that the Xiaomi 12 will be the first phone with Qualcomm's new chip the Snapdragon 898. To recall the Xiaomi 11 was also the first device with the Snapdragon 888 chip.

Around the same time as that information was revealed another leak came courtesy of IceUniverse who shared the single and multi-core Geekbench scores for the Snapdragon 898. With a 1200 single-core score and a 3900 multi-core score Qualcomm’s next flagship is set to be about 15% faster than the previous SD888. But the performance gains could be even higher as these tests likely came using hardware that is not finished just yet.

For graphics the SoC is equipped with Adreno 730 GPU. While it is not mentioned in the screenshots reports have claimed that the chipset will include the Snapdragon X65 5G modem that is said to offer 10Gbps of downlink speeds.

The vanilla Xiaomi 12 reportedly carries model number 2201122G and the Xiaomi 12 Pro bears model number 2201123G. According to recent reports the standard Xiaomi 12 will launch next month while the Xiaomi 12 Pro Xiaomi 12 Ultra will be released early next month. The company will reportedly start mass-producing Xiaomi 12 this month and the other two will be later on the production line.

Xiaomi 12 is likely to sport an LTPO panel which enables variable refresh rates with a 120 Hz peak refresh rate. The display is rumoured to boast a 2K resolution. Moreover there have been leaks suggesting Xiaomi could come with the world’s first 200 megapixel primary camera which would be a jump up from the 108 megapixel camera in the Mi 11.

Xiaomi 12 will be equipped with 120W fast charging and possibly 100W wireless charging.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9sZWFrZWRfcHJvbW9fdmlkZW9fc2hvd2Nhc2VzX2FfZmFtaWxpYXJfYnV0X25ld19vcHBvX3Jlbm82X2xpdGUtbmV3cy01MTczMi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leaked promo video showcases a familiar but new Oppo Reno6 Lite,"It seems like Oppo is just deliberately trying to confuse everybody at this point. As we are currently waiting on the Reno7 series to drop sometime this month the smartphone giant clearly has no intention of slowing down its constant rebranding and tiny specs iteration efforts this time adding yet another member to the Reno6 family. A leaked promo video showcases a Reno6 Lite apparently headed to Europe shortly and outlines most of its specs. In a hardly surprising development the Reno6 Line is basically a rebranded Oppo F19. A device that has been selling since April in India which is pretty much identical to the Oppo F19s - a phone that has also been on Indian shelves since September. OK so Oppo just decided to bring the phone to Europe under a different brand then? Well it did indeed but it also decided to bring essentially the same device to the Old Continent back in April as the Oppo A74 and is apparently planning to release the Oppo A95 shortly as well with pretty much the same hardware both inside and outside. Talk about a shotgun approach to phone sales.

Anyway the video covers most of the specs of the Reno6 Lite essentially only missing to mention the exact model of its Qualcomm chipset. We can fill in that gap with a fair bit of confidence - the Snapdragon 662. It is paired with 6GB of actual RAM with an additional 5GB of virtual RAM and there are 128GB of storage on board. Hopefully expandable via microSD though not necessarily so since the SD slot is one of the few things Oppo dropped going from the F19 to the F19s.

The Reno6 Lite will have a FHD+ AMOLED display with a punch hole selfie cam and in-display fingerprint reader. Again the video fails to mention the panel's diagonal but we have you covered - 6.43 inches. There is a 5000 mAh battery on board with 33W charging. The camera setup consists of a 48MP f/1.7 PDAF main snapper and two supplementary 2MP units - one for macro shots and the other a depth cam.

The video showcases the Reno6 Lite and its ""Reno Glow Design"" in a single color though there will likely be more options to choose from. We still don't have any info on pricing or availability but the Oppo A74 is currently selling on Amazon Germany for just shy of EUR 200 which is a fair bet to make.

Amanda Mixon speaks at the 19th Annual Fall Dermatology Conference of the Society of Dermatology Physician Assistants (SDPA).

At the annual fall meeting of the Society of Dermatology Physician Assistants Amanda Mixon PA-C said that psoriatic arthritis (PsA) occurs in 20% to 30% of individuals with psoriasis ""but my guess is that number is higher than that."" Mixon practices at the Colorado Center for Arthritis and Osteoporosis Longmont Colorado. Psoriasis usually precedes PsA by 8 to 10 years and PsA affects both genders equally usually in the fourth decade of life. Genetic and environmental factors play a role.

On clinical presentation 95% of patients with PsA have peripheral joint disease in the form of synovitis tenosynovitis dactylitis and/or enthesitis often asymmetric. ""They can have little psoriasis and terrible arthritis or vice versa"" Mixon said. ""They don't automatically correlate with each other. The one thing that does though is nail psoriasis. That will correlate with dactylitis which is basically an inflamed sausage-like finger or toe which happens for no apparent reason. That is a classic finding of psoriatic arthritis a slam dunk. It's important to refer those patients to a rheumatologist.""

She went on to note that 5% of PsA patients have axial involvement. ""Always ask psoriasis patients if they have inflammatory back pain because some of them will have axial involvement exclusively"" Mixon advised. This is different from mechanical back pain caused by manual labor or an excessive workout for example she noted. ""Mechanical back pain gets better with rest. People with inflammatory back pain feel the worst in the middle of the night and in the morning. Inflammatory proteins peak in the middle of the night so when you wake up you feel stiff. People will often say 'I feel like the Tin Man'; they have to work the [kinks] out in the morning. It improves with exercise but not with rest.""

Mixon said that this is a sign that a patient may have PsA ""So when you see psoriasis patients ask 'How's your back? Does it wake you up in the middle of the night?'""

Because enthesitis is also common in PsA Mixon also makes it a point to ask psoriasis patients if they've had any tendon problems such as plantar fasciitis or tennis elbow. Inflammation of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint is another clinical sign. ""Rheumatoid arthritis [RA] is a symmetric disease but that is not the case with PsA"" she said so if a patient with an RA diagnosis has DIP involvement ""it's not RA.""

Patients with PsA can also have asymmetric sacroiliac involvement. ""They'll complain of alternating buttock pain that wakes them up at night"" she said. ""That's an important sign that something inflammatory is going on.""

The CASPAR (Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis) criteria are often used to diagnose PsA ""but in rheumatology people don't fit into nice little boxes so there is a lot of gray"" she said. To meet criteria for PsA on CASPAR patients must have inflammatory arthritis plus at least three points from the following categories: current skin psoriasis (2 points); a history of psoriasis symptoms but no current symptoms (1 point); a family history of psoriasis and no current or past symptoms (1 point); nail symptoms such as pitting onycholysis or hyperkeratosis (1 point); a negative rheumatoid factor (1 point); and juxta-articular new bone formation on radiograph (1 point).

Therefore a patient who presents with a swollen knee or finger and also has psoriasis has almost met the criteria for PsA said Mixon who in 2019 cofounded Rheumatology Advanced Practice Providers (RhAPP) a national organization of physician assistants and nurse practitioners in rheumatology. ""Even having a family history of psoriasis qualifies as a point.""

Common comorbidities associated with PsA are wide-ranging and include gastrointestinal disorders steatosis malignancies obesity metabolic syndrome depression anxiety hypertension cardiovascular disease and uveitis. ""The majority of patients I see with PsA and psoriasis have comorbid depression"" she said. ""They're often overweight and have cardiovascular disease. That's why it's so important to get these people on treatment because with proper treatment you can mitigate that risk.""

Mixon disclosed that she is a member of the speaker's bureau for AbbVie Lilly Janssen and Amgen. She is also a consultant for Pfizer Sanofi and Novartis.

He left his 8000-square-foot penthouse apartment in Greenwich Village and hopped into a waiting Mercedes-Benz van which whizzed him a mile uptown to his helicopter propellers awhirl. Thirty-five minutes later he landed in a parking lot near the Wells Fargo Center where the 76ers play and was chauffeured to the arena in a Lincoln Navigator.

Mr. Rubin 49 is the founder and chief executive of Fanatics a 10-year-old company that manufactures and sells licensed merchandise online to fans of professional sports teams and more than 150 U.S. college athletic programs.

It has grown quickly: Because Fanatics manufactures more than 50 percent of the products it sells it’s able to respond quickly to real-time consumer demand by making items that reflect the sudden popularity of an athlete on an unforeseen streak for example or the rise of a mediocre team that unexpectedly start banking wins.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ABOUT USF FOOTBALL

– The USF football team (2-7; 1-4 American) got electric plays from several players that had Raymond James Stadium roaring but ultimately fell in a 54-42 shootout with first-place and No. 20-ranked Houston (8-1; 6-0 American) on homecoming.The Bulls opened the game with a lightning bolt from freshmanwho caught the opening kickoff at the goal line and raced 100-yards for a touchdown. He would go on to tie an NCAA record by doing it again in the second quarter this time racing by Cougars to give USF a 28-26 halftime lead. He joined Utah's Reggie Dunn as the only two players to post a pair of 100-yard returns in the same game Dunn doing it vs California in 2012.For Battie it marked his second and third 100-yard kickoff returns on the season all occurring in the last four games as he became the first USF player to post multiple 100-yard returns on their career and set USF season and career touchdown return records with three. He finished with three touchdowns on the night also posting a 29-yard touchdown run and 236 all-purpose yards.Freshman quarterbackalso had a career-best night passing for 289 yards and two touchdowns and running for a team-best 46 yards and a touchdown to account for 335 total yards. Sophomore wide receiverposted career highs with six catches for 105 yards and tight endmade a 33-yard touchdown catch on a McClain scramble play.USF's most points in a game since last year's 58-46 season-ending loss to UCF were not enough to overcome a Houston team that won its eighth straight game. The Cougars posted 646 yards of offense as junior quarterback Clayton Tune passed for 385 yards and three touchdowns and a pair of running backs eclipsed 100 yards with Ta'Zhawn Henry posting 130 yard and a touchdown and Alton McCaskill 125 yards and three touchdowns. Henry's 97-yard touchdown run in the third quarter was the longest in American Athletic Conference history.Houston responded to Battie's opening touchdown return with an 18-yard pass from Tune to Jake Herslow to tie the game at 7.Battie found the end zone again on USF's third drive making a great cutback on a 29-yard touchdown run that gave the Bulls a 14-7 lead. The play marked the Bulls' longest touchdown run of the season and Battie's second career. Battie's touchdown run was set up by a 40-yard completion from McClain to Weaver.The USF defense forced Houston to punt for a second time in the first quarter and Cougars' punter Laine Wilkins downed the ball on the Bulls 1. The Bulls couldn't move the ball off the goal line and on third downwas stopped without getting the ball out of the end zone for a safety.After a short free kick following the safety Houston marched to the USF 2 but the Bulls' defense held the Cougars out of the end zone on three plays from the 2 asbroke up a third down pass play in the end zone. Houston settled for a field goal to cut the Bulls lead to 14-12.McClain then drove USF 75 yards in the 10 plays for another touchdown hitting Brinkman on a broken play for a 33-yard touchdown pass that extend the USF lead to 21-12. It marked the longest touchdown pass of McClain's young career.Houston drove 54 yards and cut the lead with a six-yard Alton McCaskill touchdown run.McClain again took the Bulls down the field. This time he hit Jimmy Horn with a 24-yard strike and moved the Bulls to the Houston 16. But on fourth and one McClain rolled left and fired to the end zone where he was picked off by Houston cornerback Marcus Jones. After Jones' return of the interception for a touchdown was called back due to a holding penalty Tune hit Nathaniel Dell with a 55-yard touchdown pass to give Houston their first lead at 26-21.It didn't last long as Battie took the ensuing kickoff and blazed for another 100-yard return to give the Bulls a 28-26 lead at the half.Houston opened the second half by driving 67 yards in just over two minutes to retake the lead 33-28 on a two-yard run from McCaskill. The Cougars extend the lead to 39-22 on their next possession when 5-7 running back Henry shot through an interior hole and raced 97-yards for a touchdown.USF kept it close driving 65 yards and putting another touchdown on the board when McClain scrambled and hit tight endwith a 14-yard pass in the back corner of the end zone.Houston immediately rebuilt the lead using just 2:14 to move 75 yards and score on a 27-yard pass from Tune to Jeremy Singleton to lead 47-35 with 4:44 to play in the third.Both defenses dug in forcing punts on each team's next three possessions. USF broke the standstill behind some inspired play from McClain who drove the Bulls 60 yards in nine plays and capped the drive with a bobbing and weaving 11-yard touchdown run.Having cut the lead to 47-42 with 3:59 to play USF attempted an onside kick but was unable to recover it and committed a penalty on the play that gave Houston the ball at the USF 29. The Cougars used three plays to ice the game with a touchdown with 2:27 remaining.""Hats off to Houston. I thought they played excellent in the second half. We just got beat. It wasn't an effort thing. They were just better than us in the second half. It wasn't even close. That's disappointing. We had opportunities but what I told the players we just got beat in the second half by a good team. That's the negative: we didn't finish the game. The positive is that our guys played their hearts out. They continue to do it over and over again. It was not an effort thing.""""We haven't been able to break through but we did a lot of really good things. There's a lot of things to look at.had two kickoff returns for touchdowns. I think that tied an NCAA record with two 100-yard kickoff returns. A lot of really good things there. Offensively eight-of-16 on third down. I think Houston was one out of 130 Division-I FBS teams on third down coming into today's game only giving up about 25 percent on conversions. We haven't done well on third downs but I thought we did a better job tonight. I thoughtlooked healthy and looked back to what the guy we saw earlier in the year. He made some really big plays for us whenever we needed it.""tied an NCAA record with two 100-yard kickoff returns in the same game and now has three on the year to set USF marks for season and a career with three touchdown returns.– USF went 8-of-16 on third down conversions its best performance of the season.

DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES.

How To Watch/Listen: ESPNU 95.3 WDAE Bulls Unlimited

Series History: Houston leads series 5-2. Last: Houston won 56-21 in 2020.

The South Florida Bulls got to spend 10 days licking their wounds from a sloppy 29-14 loss at ECU in what could be one of their last winnable games of the year and now they must welcome in the Houston Cougars who are fresh off beating SMU last week and are looking to take full control of the AAC West. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES.

The Bulls are expected to get quarterback Timmy McClain back this week after he sat out last week’s loss due to an ankle injury. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. That should help the offense quite a bit as they look to score with a solid Cougars offense who has scored 40+ points five times this year.

Let’s take a look at the Cougars offense.

Led by quarterback Clayton Tune (161-231 1839 yards 16 TD 6 INT 69.7% completions) the Cougars have had a lot of success through the air which doesn’t bode well for the Bulls defensively. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. Houston wide receiver Nathaniel Dell (48 catches 675 yards 7 TD) was once a USF target under head coach Charlie Strong but according to sources close to the situation he was too small for the Bulls and ended up going to Houston where he’s tearing it up for the Cougars. Wide outs Christian Trahan (27 catches 301 yards 2 TD) and KeSean Carter (20 catches 208 yards 1 TD) round out the potent trio.

While they aren’t usually explosive the Cougars do convert 42% of their third downs which helps extend drives. That will be another issue for a USF defense who’s been lackluster in that department for the better part of three years. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. Defensive coordinator Glenn Spencer will need to figure something out on the “money down” because what he’s been doing hasn’t worked and there needs to be some sort of progress in that area before the season is out.

Running back Alton McCaskill leads a fairly pedestrian runnning back room led by former USF quarterback Marquel Blackwell. McCaskill has 478 yards and nine touchdowns on the ground while averaging 4.7 YPC. No other Cougar running back is averaging more that 3.7 YPC. So naturally it will be a big day for the running backs. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES

[Insert Bernie Sanders “Once again I’m asking you...” meme”

The Bulls need to create havoc force turnovers and get off the damn field to have a remote shot to win this game. The defense has been bad all year so it will be surprising to see them turn it around during the toughest part of the conference slate. But why not?

Now for the Houston defense..

They get after the quarterback. They’ve registered 32 sacks through eight games already. Six different defenders have at least 3.5 sacks and six different defenders have at least five TFL. They create havoc they force turnovers and make other teams very uncomfortable. They’re allowing under 20 points per game this year so a fast start is paramount for the Bulls.

Houston’s allowed just two touchdowns on opening drives this year (first half and second half) and the Bulls have struggled mightily in that area all year. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. McClain needs to be able to hit some of the deep shots he hit earlier in the season otherwise Houston will stack the box and make Jaren Mangham’s day next to impossible.

I don’t see a way where USF wins this game due to how poorly they match up against the Cougars. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES. DON’T KICK TO MARCUS JONES.

Houston vs USF Game Preview

Why Houston Will Win

The passing game heated up when it had to last week in the thrilling win over SMU.

The rushing attack will get 150ish yards or so but Clayton Tune is coming off a brilliant 412-yard four touchdown day with a whole lot of big plays all while taking the offense to another level.

USF has a decent pass defense but it’s hardly a rock. It allowed 220 yards or more in every game except the win over Temple and it’s about to allow at least that many in this – along with a whole lot of yards on the ground.

Houston would rather work through the air but the Bull D gave up 251 yards in the loss to East Carolina last week and 269 to Tulsa a few weeks earlier. But …

Why USF Will Win

USF has been better.

The running game ripped through Temple two weeks go and it followed it up with close to 200 yards against East Carolina. Keeping the chains moving is a bit of an issue but the offensive line hasn’t been all that bad overall and it should keep the Cougars out of the backfield.

On the flip side for all of the good things Houston has done it doesn’t allow a whole lot of sacks the rushing attack has to be forced a bit and …

What’s Going To Happen

Here comes the Houston pass rush.

Yeah the USF offensive front has been great in pass protection but there’s about to be a problem against a Houston D line that’s great at stopping offenses from getting going.

Houston is among the best teams in the country at third down stops USF is among the worst at converting on third downs.

In a bid to ramp up its car efforts Apple has hired ex-Tesla engineer Christopher Moore to work on the company’s fully autonomous vehicle. Moore has previously worked on Autopilot Tesla’s full self-driving feature that has been marred by safety concerns. At Apple he works under Stuart Bowers another former Tesla executive that led the Autopilot program before leaving the company in 2019 developing software for the upcoming Apple Car.

Moore left Tesla after stirring controversy by disregarding Elon Musk’s comments about the full self-driving capability of the company's EVs. Talking to the officials from the California Department of Motor Vehicles Moore stated that Musk’s claim about Tesla vehicles becoming fully autonomous in 2021 doesn’t represent the reality. According to Bloomberg Moore has also been invited to act as a witness in a lawsuit against Tesla.

Apple is accelerating the development of EVs. We’ve previously reported that the iPhone-maker might be partnering with Toyota to produce its cars. According to Reuters Cupertino is getting ready to unveil its first consumer EV in 2024.

While version 0.9.1 introduces numerous fixes it contains no new features. Konami expected to add features next week with version 1.0.0 but it has delayed the update until spring 2022.

Konami has released the first patch to eFootball 2022 bringing the game to version 0.9.1. For context the game arrived not even half-baked as version 0.9.0 and will go down as one of the worst releases of 2021 if not of the last few years.

Version 0.9.1 of the game delivers a litany of fixes outlined in Konami's changelog. However this month's update does not contain any new features the release of which Konami delayed by about a week or so. . For some reason Konami has been unable to fix the following issues which 'may still happen occasionally:

Some players may be shown gliding on the ground during a match.

Players may run in a strange fashion during the goal celebration.

Player models may be distorted and their movements may feel unnatural when they collide with each other.

Fouls may not be given out to some plays that were clearly fouls.

The ball may pass through a player's body during a match.

The responsiveness to command inputs may become slower during matches.

The speed of the ball and player movement may decrease during matches.

If that was not bad enough Konami has also delayed its version 1.0.0 update originally due on November 11. Inexplicably the company has postponed this update until Spring 2022. Spring 2022 starts on March 20 and ends on June 21. Hence Konami has given itself until the middle of next year just to reach version 1.0.0 of the game.",,,

Public Works Director Kelly Smith said there’s a major concern about the recycling program because 30% to 40% of items collected from bins are soiled or nonrecyclable.

“We need to get back on track and recycle right” Smith said.

The city has a plan in place officials hope will improve the situation.

Smith said Hobart will collect recycling weekly. Tags will be placed on bins that have contamination and it will be up to residents to address the contamination before the bins are collected again the next week.

The city could take away recycling bins from residences in which there have been multiple issues of contamination.

Republic Services provides solid waste disposal services to Hobart and the municipality pays about $60 per ton for trash disposal. Smith said recycling is hauled to a third-party facility which has stopped taking Hobart’s recycling because of the contamination.

“We are not the only municipality that is going through this” Smith said.

Plastic bags are the biggest issue in “a long list of problems” she said.

She said plastic bags can get entangled and jammed in machines at the recycling facility which can slow down production and damage the machinery.

Other nonrecyclable items commonly found in Hobart recycling bins include food waste styrofoam clothing wood yard waste large plastic toys garden hoses and electrical cords.

The Public Works Department’s budget is taking a hit about $20000 per month because the recycling is going to the landfill instead of the recycling facility.

Smith said the recycling facility will continue to review the items Hobart collects each week. It will start accepting materials again after it has determined the contamination has been adequately addressed.

If people are unsure whether an item should be put in the trash bin or recycled it’s best to throw it in the garbage to avoid contamination.

Smith said the city also has applied for a grant that would be used to educate residents about recycling.

“I believe residents really want to do their part and recycle but they may not be aware what they put in their bin is causing this contamination” she said.

Nowhere quite represents a consumer-driven and disposable culture like this.

Everyday rubbish is ditched - along with the responsibility for it.

Image: The average American produces nearly a ton of rubbish every year -three times as much as the average Briton.

But collectively it remains our problem or one for generations to come.

And in consumer-obsessed America the scale is quite something.

I'd not visited a landfill site before. Up close they are an overwhelming sight.

With the site manager I watch as more land is cleared and holes dug for more and more waste.

Managing our waste

Huge trucks shuttle in and out. The average American produces nearly a ton of rubbish every year. That's three times as much as the average Britton.

Image: Site manager Zachary Pedersen is passionate about how landfills can affect change

Globally we are seemingly unstoppable generators of waste which is why management is so vital.

And that's what's brought us to this particular site: Blue Ridge Landfill to the south of Houston.

Zachary Pedersen manages Blue Ridge which takes the waste from America's fourth largest city.

As he takes me for a drive around it's clear he loves his job. He's proud too of a process that despite wider flaws caused by our consumer culture and failures in regulation is he says sustainable.

""My passion for landfills is that I can affect change. It affects our community it affects being a good neighbour it affects the environment"" Mr Pedersen tells me.

""You know I am directly affecting the world my daughter is going to grow up in"" he says.

It's striking how green much of this vast site is. Areas that were once open landfill are now covered sealed and topped with pasture. I watch a farm tractor cutting the grass and there's even wildlife - geese and the famous Texas Longhorn.

Capturing methane

Under the grass is tonnes of waste in various states of decomposition and dotted all over the landscape are small black pipes poking out of the ground.

Image: Cows and the cattle industry are often blamed for contributing to greenhouse gas emissions

This is methane capture in action. We hear a lot about methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and even more about how cows and the cattle industry are contributing to emissions of the potent greenhouse gas.

But unmanaged our own rubbish as it decomposes can contribute huge quantities of methane into the atmosphere helping to warm our planet faster than carbon dioxide.

In America alone landfill accounts for nearly 20% of human-caused methane emissions which over a 20-year period is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:04 US National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy calls methane a 'super global warming chemical' and that the US 'can do better'

But here at Blue Ridge they are operating a system of methane capture that's increasingly common across the developed world.

The tonnes and tonnes of waste brought to the site is flattened and compacted on top of a plastic shell which lines the landfill. Eventually the section of landfill is sealed and pressurised.

The 'milkshake technique'

Image: The site uses a special 'milkshake technique' to suck methane from a series of wells

The site's environmental manager Raymond Whitlock explains how the methane can be sucked out using a series of wells which dot the landscape and puncture the pasture.

""The example I like to use: if you imagine a milkshake the straw in the milkshake; the milkshake's your landfill the straw is the extraction well; you exert the vacuum using your mouth or in our case a blower system and the contents is removed"" Mr Whitlock says.

A series of underground pipes take the extracted methane to a refinery on the edge of Blue Ridge. There it is cleaned purified and sold on to power cars and heat homes.

According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this plant has the capacity to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent of more than 51000 cars on local roads.

Republic Services who operate Blue Ridge and 74 other sites across America say they now generate enough renewable energy to fully power more than 250000 homes annually.

Recycling failures

It's not all good news though.

While Blue Ridge is a success in its efforts to capture methane it also illustrates a much bigger societal problem.

The amount of plastic and cardboard at the site is staggering. America's record at recycling is appalling.

Between 2015 and 2018 the rate actually fell from 34% to just 32% according to figures from the Environmental Protection Agency. In the UK the recycling rate is about 45%.

But in methane capture Blue Ridge is an impressive success story. They use a technology increasingly deployed around the developed world and it is having an impact in slowing global warming.

And yet beyond in the developing world it's an ever growing challenge requiring investment and funding.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwOi8vd3d3LjM0c3QuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMS8xMS9qcGVnbWFmaWEtbHAtYWxsLW15LWhlcm9lcy1hcmUtY29ybmJhbGxzLWV4cGVyaW1lbnRhbC1ob3AtaGlwLWhhemFyZC1kdXR5LXBsYXktb25saW5lLW9mZmxpbmUtdmVyc2lvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Controversy Behind JPEGMAFIA's 'LP!' Reveals the Problem With Music Labels,"Following the release of his widely praised All My Heroes Are Cornballs in 2019 Barrington Hendricks better known as JPEGMAFIA delved even deeper into his rap niche. In the next two years Hendricks dropped two extended plays (EPs) appropriately titled EP! and EP2! that experimented further with the already inventive genre. His fourth album LP! combines the melodic nature of his more recent output with his signature avant—garde production to create one of his most expressive and unique works yet.

Even though Hendricks opted for ambience on EP2! “TRUST!” immediately indicates a return to old form. While he begins the track through soft raspy whispers the driving beats in the background bring out the energy that was previously absent. Although EP2!’s subdued liveliness was suitable for its release during the pandemic the bright xylophones that appear on “TRUST!” signify a turn to a more optimistic future. Accordingly Hendricks talks about self—appreciation. He mentions how he just “speaks facts” while others are just “bluffin’” and this doesn’t stop him from “still feeling nice” even if he’s “been fucked over” by others. He labels those around him as “conniving” because he “can’t believe them” but as long as he’s “feeling nice” he thinks “everything’s great.”

Hendricks’ introspective analysis continues on “END CREDITS!” where he talks about the emotional aftermath of loss. His belting vocals are backed by a distinctly rocklike production and the never—ending strums of an overwhelming electric guitar also highlight Hendricks’ profound realizations. In the chorus he recognizes that behind the “steam and the hype” of his life it’s the “loss” that truly affects him the most. To prevent the negativity from seeping into his everyday thoughts Hendricks searches for solutions. When it comes to losses related to his career he professes that it’s “not a dice.” He wants to take back full control from the mysterious hands of fate. “END CREDITS!” is only two minutes long similar to others on LP! but those precious seconds are spent putting himself on a path towards steadfast determination and not towards an end credits scene without substance

Depending on how the listener consumes LP! the track following “END CREDITS!” differs. Hendricks originally planned to release LP! like any other album but after label politics and sample clearances interfered with his plans he decided to create an online and offline version. In a tweet directed at his label Hendricks expressed his frustrations with the sampling process and how labels were asking him to “prove .. this isn’t a sample” leading to the delay of LP!

Cutting corners can be costly for everyone involved legally and artistically. Eventually this led to a rift between Hendricks and his label. The online version is the official one endorsed for streaming services but the offline version is Hendricks’ true vision of the album. It has more tracks different title names and changes in song composition. The offline version was still put on less restrictive digital platforms such as YouTube and Bandcamp but Hendricks had to do so independently without the backing of his label. In the end the LP! found on Spotify or Apple Music is an artistically inaccurate representation of Hendricks’ true interpretation of his music.









The single “HAZARD DUTY PAY!” is one of those tracks that appears only on the offline version. In the description of the music video Hendricks references the sample dispute with a short “couldn’t clear it. :(“ This sentiment is shared by many other smaller artists such as Shygirl whose track “BB” had to be replaced due to sample copyright issues. The sample that Hendricks uses on “HAZARD DUTY PAY!” is what makes it stand out. After a jazzy R&B introduction the track transitions into Hendricks’ percussive and frantically energetic beats. By now the listener is accustomed to Hendricks’ distinct production techniques which he calls “DNA all in y’all beats.” To further support the acknowledgment of his impact in hip—hop Hendricks criticizes the “fake [rappers]” who replace impactful ones after they die. His confident delivery of the lyrics backs up his assertive self—praise ranging from “Peggy keep scoring” to “Peggy the GOAT.” Ironically one of Hendricks’ most assured songs is kept back by his label who he also calls out in the track as part of a family of “burners.”









For an artist signed to a big label like Republic Records which is home to Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande Hendricks is more likely to have his samples approved. They play an integral role in his eccentric take on more conventional production not just on LP! but also on his previous work. His sample portfolio includes Swift’s “Delicate” in the outro of “Post Verified Lifestyle” from All My Heroes Are Cornballs and part of a Trump speech on “The BENDS!” from EP!. Relegating uncleared songs to unofficial platforms ignores Hendricks’ intended takeaways behind LP! and instead favors the executives of Republic Records. Artistic integrity and proper credit are important but so are the wishes of innovative artists like Hendricks and Shygirl.

On almost every track of LP! Hendricks whispers one of his trademark phrases: “You think you know me.” Through tracks like “TRUST!” and “END CREDITS!” we do get a closer glimpse of Hendricks’ personality and beliefs. But our relationship with the rapper is limited without also considering his bold claims on “HAZARD DUTY PAY!.” Some of the tracks on the online version give us a more detailed view of the rapper but the true Hendricks is still masked behind the overarching power of Republic Records. Now that Hendricks is set to leave his label and return to his independent roots we can finally get to know him as he intended.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2QFodHRwczovL2tlbWx1LmdvLmlkL2FudGFuYW5hcml2by9lbi9uZXdzLzE3MjEzL3RoZS1taW5pc3Rlci1vZi1uYXRpb25hbC1kZWZlbnNlLW9mLXRoZS1yZXB1YmxpYy1vZi1tYWRhZ2FzY2FyLXdhcy1kZWVwbHktdG91Y2hlZC1ieS10aGUtaW5hdWd1cmF0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS1pbmRvbmVzaWEtbWFkYWdhc2Nhci1mcmllbmRzaGlwLXBhcmstYXQtd2lzbWEtaW5kb25lc2lhLWl2YXRv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Minister of National Defense of the Republic of Madagascar was deeply touched by the inauguration of the ...,,,,

Bayern Munich became only the second team to score 100 Bundesliga goals in a calendar year as they inflicted a first league defeat of the season on Freiburg.

Thomas Muller unselfishly set up Leon Goretzka for the opener after half an hour before Robert Lewandowski doubled the lead 15 minutes from time with his 60th goal of 2021 after good play by Alphonso Davies.

Third-placed Freiburg scored a late consolation through Janik Haberer as it finished 2-1.

Leaders Bayern have six league games left before the winter break and only need one more goal to equal Cologne’s record of 101 Bundesliga goals in 1977.

Lewandowski’s goals for Bayern and Poland in this year have come in only 50 games.

Bayern are four points above second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 2-1 at RB Leipzig.

Christopher Nkunku gave Leipzig who move up to fifth the lead before Marco Reus equalised early in the second half. Nkunku then provided the cross for Yussuf Poulsen scored the winner.

Wolfsburg are up to fourth after Lukas Nmecha’s early strike gave them a 1-0 home win against Augsburg.

Masaya Okugawa’s 19th-minute goal was enough for Arminia Bielefeld to get their first league win of the season sealing a 1-0 success at fellow strugglers Stuttgart.

Milos Pantovic scored deep into stoppage time to seal a 2-0 victory for Bochum against Hoffenheim. Soma Novothny had broken the deadlock after 66 minutes.

Ansu Fati looked to suffer a hamstring injury on Saturday (Lalo R Villar/AP) ( AP )

Barcelona surrendered a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Celta Vigo in a game which also saw Ansu Fati suffer a hamstring injury.

The highly-rated teenager netted Barcelona’s early opener as they raced into a 3-0 half-time lead with Sergi Busquets and Memphis Depay also on the score sheet.

However Fati limped off moments before the break clutching the back of his left leg. Celta Vigo then scored three second-half goals to rescue a point with their comeback completed by a last-gasp equaliser from Iago Aspas.

Aspas had started the fight back before Nolito got the hosts within a goal of Barcelona with just over quarter of an hour remaining.

It was Sergi Barjuan’s final game as Barcelona’s caretaker manager with the club announcing late on Friday that Xavi would become their next permanent coach.

Real Madrid returned to the top of the table with a 2-1 win against Rayo Vallecano at the Bernabeu in the late kick-off.

Goals from Toni Kroos and Karim Benzema put the hosts in control at the break but Radamel Falcao replied 15 minutes from the end to set up a nervy finish for Carlo Ancelotti’s men.

Thibaut Courtois made a fine save in injury time to ensure his side took all three points.

LaLiga’s bottom club Levante are still looking for their first win of the season after losing 2-1 at Alaves.

Jorge De Frutos raised hopes of a maiden success when he put the visitors ahead but Joselu equalised from the penalty spot after 77 minutes before scoring a stoppage-time winner.

First-half goals from Adria Pedrosa and Raul De Tomas gave Espanyol and 2-0 home win against Granada.

Atalanta are up to fourth in Serie A following their 2-1 win at bottom club Cagliari. Mario Pasalic and Duvan Zapata scored for the visitors either side of Joao Pedro’s equalising goal.

Late goals from Alberth Elis and M’Baye Niang could not prevent runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint Germain from claiming another victory at Bordeaux.

PSG were all ready firmly in the driving seat through Neymar’s double and a Kylian Mbappe effort before Elis’ 78th-minute reply. Niang narrowed the deficit to a single goal in stoppage time but Mauricio Pochettino’s team won 3-2 and stay top of the table by 10 points.

In a recent Q&A session with The Wrestling Observer former WWE Producer Lance Storm heaped praise on RAW Superstar Seth Rollins.

""I can't say enough good things about Seth Rollins"" Storm said. ""I produced a lot of segments with Seth. A lot of times with Seth it was me and Michael Hayes. It was at the time where Seth was a big frickin part of the show. You get the Seth Rollins segment and it's like ok he has two backstage segments he has an in-ring promo then he has a promo before his match. The dude has like eight segments. He's running full tilt all day and very easy to work with.

""When you get to him it's like 'We need to work this out' and he's like 'Alright.' He gets called away he comes back and he's got eight balls in the air. He's always easy to deal with. There was one time in particular. He was working with Mysterio. Again he's got like eight balls in the air. They're debating this one spot into the near fall. He went to go the one way and I'm like 'No.' He looked at me and said 'Really?' and I'm like 'Yea.' He said 'Ok' and they went the other way. That's where again he has 87 balls in the air. I'm focused on this one thing and he was willing to trust me that this is good. He probably shouldn't spend an hour debating this point. He's got 18 balls in the air. So I really loved working with Seth Rollins.""

Storm also praised Rollins for being ""humble enough to take advice"" when it's given.

""Again there's times where he's doing so much that he's going out there and still doesn't know a lot of key elements and it's like 'I'll talk to you on the headset go out there' and he gets the job done. He was incredibly great to work with. No matter how much crap you threw at that dude he could catch it with one hand and keep it juggling while he was doing everything else. Being able to do that and then also having that vision that if we disagree it's not me vs him. We're both trying to get the product out there on time and good. He was incredibly great and easy to deal with.

""I don't think anyone watching has any concept of how much on many of these shows that this dude has on his plate and he manages to pull it off. So a guy like that that can both multitask be humble enough to take advice when it's given and smart enough to also do so much and do it so well he was again of all the guys I had to produce there I can't say enough good things about Seth Rollins.""

Rollins and his wife RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch were both moved from SmackDown to RAW during the recent WWE Draft.

The movie Clueless hit the big screen in 1995. It is a coming-of-age teen comedy that paired up an amazing group of actors and actresses. Among them Alicia Silverstone Paul Rudd and Brittany Murphy. Little did anyone know during its 40-day filming schedule that it would end up being one of the best teen films of all time. In fact 25 years after filming it still appeals to teens and even some adults. And that’s largely due to the fact that Clueless casting director Marcia Ross could see that Paul Rudd’s chemistry with Alicia Silverstone was obviously there.

Here’s why casting director Marcia Ross chose Alicia Silverstone and Brittany Murphy

By the time Clueless was made Silverstone had already established herself as a star. Her acting career began when she was just 6 years old with television commercials. It kicked off in a big way after she made a guest appearance on The Wonder Years as Fred Savage’s (Kevin Arnold) dream girl.

After the guest appearance she had several TV movies released abd starred in several Aerosmith videos. And then came Clueless the movie that would absolutely make her a household name among teens.

In order to snag the role of Cher Horowitz she beat out other stars including Reese Witherspoon Sarah Michelle Gellar and Zooey Deschanel who were each popular. However Ross says that Silverstone bagged the part instantly during her audition.

Murphy was a little tougher though she also got the part during her audition. Ross had the ability to spot young talent and instantly saw something special in Murphy. She has said that Murphy was very sweet and insecure. Ross also says that Murphy was incredibly talented and failed to realize it which are qualities that appealed to Ross on a personal level.

There was undeniable chemistry between Paul Rudd and Silverstone in ‘Clueless’

Another shoo-in for the movie was Rudd who interestingly wasn’t even supposed to be in the movie. At the time he was taking part in another movie Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers during casting for Clueless. The man who was actually expected to be in Clueless was Ben Affleck.

As luck would have it Paul managed to come in and read with Alicia Silverstone for Clueless. It was a moment that stands out to Ross because their “chemistry was instant the connection was just there. They were just great together. You couldn’t deny he was the right person to play Josh.”

Why does ‘Clueless’ hold such mass appeal?

Over the years it has been revealed that Silverstone was given creative liberty while on the set of Clueless. She could change things as she felt she needed to. However this is just one fun fact about this iconic movie. From clothing that came from thrift stores to the fact that Silverstone took home all of her outfits after production there are a lot of little interesting facts about this movie.

Considering the mass appeal it is unimaginable that some networks wouldn’t back Clueless because of the relationship between Rudd and Silverstone. In the movie the two were ex-step siblings and networks like Fox thought it was “wrong” to have that relationship occur.

Amy Heckerling the writer and director of Clueless based certain parts of it on her own teen years. The two most noteworthy parts were the fact that Cher struggled to pass her driving test and Dionne (Stacey Dash) had a tremendous fear of driving. Heckerling also put a lot of effort into studying teens in Beverly Hills High School to learn how they talked dressed and interacted with one another.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Flying into Calgary one bleak day last winter Natale met his counterpart in an airport hangar to thrash out the key terms of the union one that had been coveted for decades by the company’s late founder Ted Rogers .

Little did Natale know that Ted Rogers’s only son at that moment was already maneuvering to oust him.

Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed. Abbe Lowell his lead defense lawyer said in a statement that the team will appeal the panel’s decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3dpbGtpbnNidXJnLWFubmV4YXRpb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yZWZsZWN0cy1tZXJnZXItaHVyZGxlcy1mb3ItcGEtcy0yNTYwLW11bmljaXBhbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wilkinsburg annexation failure reflects merger hurdles for Pa.'s 2560 municipalities,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/local/regional/wilkinsburg-annexation-failure-reflects-merger-hurdles-for-pa-s-2560-municipalities/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3dpbGtpbnNidXJnLWFubmV4YXRpb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yZWZsZWN0cy1tZXJnZXItaHVyZGxlcy1mb3ItcGEtcy0yNTYwLW11bmljaXBhbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2hvcHBpbmcvc2FicmluYS1lbGJhLXNhYmxlLWxhYnMtc2tpbi1jYXJlLW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy0xMjM1ODk1NzgwL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2hvcHBpbmcvc2FicmluYS1lbGJhLXNhYmxlLWxhYnMtc2tpbi1jYXJlLW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy0xMjM1ODk1NzgwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sabrina Elba Opens Up About A-Beauty Skin Care Line S’Able Labs: “African Ingredients Are So Powerful”,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

The finding of 'reasonable' evidence to conclude that the U.S. ally had breached international law in its conduct of the war in Gaza was released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday.

It is the strongest statement that the Biden administration has made yet.

But the caveat that the U.S. was unable immediately to link specific U.S. weapons to individual strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.

The first-of-its-kind assessment which was compelled by President Joe Biden´s fellow Democrats in Congress comes after seven months of airstrikes ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35000 Palestinians mostly women and children.

Those were launched in response to Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 2023 that saw 1300 Israelis murdered.

While U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes the report said given Israel's 'significant reliance' on U.S.-made weapons it was 'reasonable to assess' that they had been used by Israel's security forces in instances 'inconsistent' with its obligations under international humanitarian law 'or with best practices for mitigating civilian harm.'

Israel's military has the experience technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians but 'the results on the ground including high levels of civilian casualties raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases' the report said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen the Maryland Democrat who led the push in Congress told reporters that even even though the administration had reached a general finding 'they´re ducking a determination on the hard cases politically inconvenient cases.'

Biden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s war against Hamas.

He has faced growing rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and the onset of famine caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the movement of food and aid into Gaza.

Tensions have been heightened further in recent weeks by Netanyahu´s pledge to expand the Israeli military´s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah despite Biden's adamant opposition.

Biden is in the closing months of a tough reelection campaign against Donald Trump. He faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need.

Rep. Michael McCaul the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the review was unnecessary 'and only contributes to politically motivated anti-Israel sentiment.'

'Now is the time to stand with our ally Israel and ensure they have the tools they need' he said in a statement.

The Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a shipment of 3500 bombs out of concern over Israel´s threatened offensive on Rafah a southern city crowded with more than a million Palestinians a senior administration official said.

The presidential directive agreed to in February obligated the Defense and State departments to conduct 'an assessment of any credible reports or allegations that such defense articles and as appropriate defense services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law including international humanitarian law.'

Nothing in the presidential directive would have triggered any cutoff of arms if the administration had more definitively ruled that Israel´s conduct had violated international law.

The agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they deemed that Israel has acted to 'arbitrarily to deny restrict or otherwise impede directly or indirectly' delivery of any U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians there.

On this question the report cited 'deep concerns' that Israel played a significant role in preventing adequate aid from reaching starving Palestinians. However it said Israel had recently taken some positive steps although still inadequate and the U.S. government did not currently find Israel restricting aid deliveries in a way that violated U.S. law governing foreign militaries that receive U.S. military aid.

Van Hollen accused the administration of glossing over what he said were clear Israeli blocks on food and aid deliveries during much of the war. 'That´s why we have hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that have nothing to do with Hamas on the verge of starvation' he said.

Lawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support an accusation the Biden administration denies. They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific Israeli airstrikes on schools crowded neighborhoods medical workers aid convoys and other targets and restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza violated the laws of war and human rights.

Their opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel´s military and further heighten tensions with Netanyahu´s hard-right government over its conduct of the war against Hamas.

Any finding against Israel also could endanger Biden´s support in this year's presidential elections from some voters who keenly support Israel.

At the time the White House agreed to the review it was working to head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to Israel.

Israel launched its offensive after an Oct. 7 assault into Israel led by Hamas killed about 1200 people. Two-thirds of the Palestinians killed since then have been women and children according to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.

Human rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January in a case brought by South Africa the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it could to prevent death destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

Israel says it is following all U.S. and international law that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.

Biden in December said 'indiscriminate bombing' was costing Israel international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April the Biden administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to Israel if it didn´t change its handling of the war and humanitarian aid.

Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s and early 1990s were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or toward Palestinians.

A report to the Biden administration by an unofficial self-formed panel including military experts academics and former State Department officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys journalists hospitals schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that the civilian death toll in those strikes - such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians - was disproportionate to the blow against any military target."

Why it matters: Accurately predicting the future is impossible — who do you think you are Hari Seldon? — but scenario planning can help governments and businesses prepare for the different possibilities that could be coming our way.

How it works: Scenario planning is a forecasting method that involves not making predictions per se but ""making decisions in the face of uncertainty"" says Peter Schwartz senior vice president of strategic planning at Salesforce.

Instead of locking in on one possible future scenario planners develop multiple different possibilities and try to tease out how decisions made in the present can make those scenarios more or less likely to come true.

""It gives me guidance for making my decisions in the face of really fundamental uncertainty"" says Schwartz who has worked in the field for nearly 50 years.

Context: In September Schwartz worked with Accenture Research and economic policy and health experts to develop scenarios for navigating what he calls ""the pandemic era.""

The top line scenario is ""the uplift"": a return to robust global economic growth assuming COVID containment improves inflation doesn't spiral out of control no variant worse than Delta emerges and geopolitical tensions don't tighten.

Schwartz views the uplift scenario as ""quite plausible"" — in part because of continued progress against the pandemic — though he worries about the X-factor of inflation.

The other side: Should inflation keep rising it could lead to a global shakeout and possibly a recession — though even here Schwartz and his colleagues foresee an ultimate recovery.

The worst scenario would involve the emergence of a more dangerous and vaccine-resistant variant which would further disrupt supply chains and lead to a fracturing of the world into different geopolitical blocs.

The bottom line: By juggling multiple possible futures companies governments and even individuals can ensure they're ready for what comes — come what may.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvSG93LWlzLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy1jaGFuZ2luZy1iaXJ0aHMtaW4tQ2FsaWZvcm5pYS0xNjU3NzUxMy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How is the pandemic changing births in California?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/How-is-the-pandemic-changing-births-in-California-16577513.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvSG93LWlzLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy1jaGFuZ2luZy1iaXJ0aHMtaW4tQ2FsaWZvcm5pYS0xNjU3NzUxMy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmVwYWxpdGltZXMuY29tL2xhdGVzdC93aWxsLW5lcGFsLWV2ZXItYmUtcGFpZC1mb3Itc2F2aW5nLXRyZWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Nepal ever be paid for saving trees?,"Photo: KUNDA DIXIT

Last week the Nepal government signed a carbon trading agreement with the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance (LEAF) Coalition under which the country would stand to earn Rs36 billion in the next four years for protecting its forests.

The figure ‘Rs36 billion’ made headlines in Nepal and there was widespread expectation that the country would finally be compensated for doubling its forest cover in the past 40 years and for setting aside 26% of its area for nature reserves.

However it does not seem to be as simple as that.

“Whether Nepal will ever get the money for expanding its carbon sink and how much we will be paid is not certain” says Buddha Poudel of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. “And then there is the question of whether Nepal will be able to fulfil its commitment to expand our forest cover further. It is not enough to talk at the UNFCCC it needs a lot more work.”

Nepal made the commitment to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) at the COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow on 2 November. LEAF brings together 17 members including the United States Britain Norway as well as 20 private companies who have pledged $1 billion for forest conservation.

Industrialised countries and large corporations are under pressure in Glasgow to show that they are not just cutting down on their own emissions but supporting forest expansion around the world to make up for their historical emissions.

LEAF is the mechanism with which they hope to support forestry activities in low income countries. Among its private sector members are Delta Airlines Walmart BlackRock AirBnB Amazon Nestle Unilever Salesforce Bayer Burberry EY Inditex Intertek.

The LEAF initiative was among a series of agreements signed in Glasgow last week to protect forests worldwide including theWorld Leaders Summit Action on Forests & Land Use agreed to by 130 world leaders. Other initiatives included a pledge by 12 countries pledged to provide $12 billion of public climate finance from 2021 to 2025 to a new Global Forest Finance Pledge. There was $3 billion more pledged for protecting the Congo basin and forest-dwelling indigenous groups.

The funding countries hope that this carbon trading mechanism will make up for their high per capita emissions by paying to protect carbon sinks in tropical forests around the world. The UNFCCC set up the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism ever since COP3 and under the Kyoto Protocol.

Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Nepal benefited from funding for hydropower improved wood burning stoves biogas and other projects.

Nepal first joined REDD+ in 2009 and in 2020 signed a multi-million dollar contract with the World Bank to sell nine million metric tonnes of carbon reserves at $5 per ton.

But carbon trade is a long and winding process. According to Paudel at Environemnt Ministry to get the payment as agreed by 2022 Nepal has to carry out seven activities and confirm that the emissions from the forest area (13 districts in the Terai western Nepal and Bagmati province) have reduced and carbon reserves have increased compared to 2018.

But the forest areas of Bara Parsa Nawalparasi Rupandehi Kapilvastu and Kailali which have been contracted with the World Bank for carbon trading are seeing rampant encroachment and deforestation with no efforts deployed to stop them.

The forest area is shrinking further due to the indiscriminate construction of infrastructure by the local and state governments as well as private contractors.

“There is now an increasing trend of using forest land for development projects with an approval from the federal government this has increased encroachment and made it more difficult to stop deforestation” says Sindhu Dhungana former head of the REDD+ Implementation Centre.

He adds: ""Whether we get money or not is a different matter but the activities we do to get money will help in our forest conservation.""

On the other hand parts of Nepal saw a seven-month winter drought followed by unprecedented forest fires that burned for more than three months earlier this year. These wildfires contribute largely to the carbon footprint and are increasing every year adding to the challenge of reducing emissions from the forest areas.

Nepal as one of the countries most impacted by the climate crisis ought to be a role model to the rest of the world by reducing emissions from the forests and increase the carbon reserves but it is looking unlikely by the passing minute.

Nepal’s community forest program has won international praise for restoring the country’s tree cover but the management of the forests under the new federal structure threatens to undermine past gains. As such the Environment Ministry has recommended handing over the forests once again to the community for their sustainable management.

Similarly 30000 hectares of the new forest should be developed across the country by planting trees on public vacant or private land. Nepal has also agreed to manage 10000 hectares of pro-poor forest distribute 120000 improved stoves to replace burning firewood use forest area based on land use policy and reduce carbon emissions by preventing wildfires.

Our officials signed the letter of intent with the LEAF Coalition but there is no roadmap on how to proceed or which steps to take. Which is why it is premature for Nepal to expect any money without concrete measures to reduce our emissions further.",,,,,,

""We have been expecting a material slowdown in both economic and earnings growth amid a mid cycle transition"" he wrote in a recent note to clients. ""The Delta variant is not the primary reason why growth has slowed in our view. Instead we think it's simply a more dramatic mid cycle transition than normal given the speed and velocity of the recovery so far.""

He also writes that the supply chain problems will last longer than most traders expect and demand from consumers is going to be weaker than they believe.

""We think the growth slowdown will be worse and last longer than expected — i.e. well into the first half of 2022 as the payback in demand arrives with the sharp y/y decline in personal disposable income"" he said.

It's well-known that Americans built up a lot of savings during COVID thanks to stimulus payments and the absence of many forms of non-streaming entertainment and leisure. While some prognosticators think those savings will keep the economy afloat for a while Wilson says the money has been spent and consumers are roughly back to pre-pandemic savings levels now.

He added that a survey by National Public Radio and Harvard found that 59% of households with less than $50000 in annual income reported severe financial problems in the last few months while 38% of all households said the same.

That helps explain a recent dip in consumer confidence and it could mean people are about to spend far less than investors think they will. Wilson suggests that that's a setup for economic and stock market disappointment even before factoring in the supply chain issues and other problems.

""A key message from us over the next several weeks is to stay selective and to stay more defensive in terms of positioning"" Wilson wrote. ""We continue to like relatively reasonably priced Software over Hardware and Semis in Tech Services over Goods in Discretionary Financials and Healthcare.""

As the holiday shopping season picks up retailers across the country hope to get a lift from another wave of spenders: international tourists who can visit the U.S. once again Starting Monday the Biden administration will allow visitors from abroad into the country again. Most foreign travelers from more than 30 countries including the U.K. and Brazil have been restricted since early 2020 as Covid-19 cases rose globally. Visitors must be fully vaccinated against Covid and have a negative Covid test within three days before departure. Exemptions apply to travelers under the age of 18 if they have medical reasons preventing them from getting a vaccine or are traveling from one of 50 countries with low vaccine availability. For retailers the policy is a much-awaited change that may help them fill up stores and ring up bigger sales again. At stake are billions of dollars that tourists spend on not only souvenirs but luxury handbags high-end makeup top-shelf liquor and other items they often can't find at home. Global visitors fueled more than $43.4 billion of shopping in 2019 — or 27% of the total shopping driven by travel and tourism according to the International Trade Administration. Yet retail experts and companies say it will take time for tourists to return to the U.S. and spend at post-pandemic levels. Airlines still have fewer flights. Other countries including China tightly restrict outbound travel. And pandemic-related logistics from long lines at the airport to show proof at vaccination to Covid test when returning home could delay travelers from booking a trip. ""Airlines will tell you that they are seeing a surge in booking. What they don't quantify is when. Hotels will tell you is they're seeing an uptick in bookings. What they won't tell you is when"" said Daniel Binder a partner for Columbus Consulting who focuses on travel retail. ""The ban will lift and it will take time."" Binder saw the spending power of international tourists — especially Chinese tourists — up close as a longtime executive at DFS a luxury goods travel retailer that's owned by LVMH. He said he also saw the many months it took for global tourists to flock back and spend freely after other challenging periods including the 9/11 terrorism attacks and the SARS outbreak. Still National Retail Federation CEO Matt Shay said there is a feeling of optimism as the ban lifts. He said that as Americans feel comfortable booking trips dining out and having more active lives they are also shopping. As international tourists visit that will ""give a jolt to the retail side"" too he said. ""The return to the service and the experience economy is going to be positive and beneficial for retail and it's going to be enhanced furthermore by these international visitors returning to the U.S."" he said Wednesday on a call with reporters.

'Shot in the arm' for New York City

International shoppers will be a key ingredient needed for New York City's recovery. During a typical year visitors from other countries spend an estimated $4.75 billion on shopping according to NYC & Company the city's tourism board. Shopping is the most popular activity for people visiting the city from other countries — with 88% of international visitors saying they participate according to a 2018 survey by the Department of Commerce. That's compared to 86% who participate in sightseeing 54% who go to art galleries and museums and 29% who experience fine dining. In contrast less than 30% of tourists from other parts of the U.S. shop when they are in New York City. ""It's a pivotal milestone in our recovery for sure"" said Chris Heywood executive vice president of global communications at NYC & Company. ""Welcoming back the international traveler is exactly the shot in the arm that New York City needs right now.""

In the coming days Heywood said the tourism group will unveil a project with Macy's Bloomingdale's Saks Fifth Avenue and other retailers to incentivize visitors to return to their stores. Over the next few months he said the group plans to spend $6 million across the globe on advertising about New York City. He said that money will be concentrated in countries that have loosened their policies in a way that makes it easier for their citizens to leave and return home. These include South Korea Canada Mexico Brazil Germany France and Italy. Places where restrictions are till very tight such as China will not be part of the advertising campaign.

Heywood said New York City benefits from having many shopping districts that are themselves tourist destinations — such as Fifth Avenue Times Square and Hudson Yards — along with attractions like Broadway shows and art museums. ""This is a chance to actually get back to this notion of that shopping experience and having the bragging rights to say 'I bought that on Fifth Avenue' or 'I bought that in New York'"" he said. ""That's something people have not been able to have."" Still he said it will take years to build back up the city's tourism and shopping revenue. The group expects about 2.8 million international visitors to come to New York City this year compared with 13.5 million international visitors in 2019. Next year it expects international visitors to triple to about 8.5 million and by 2024 it expects international tourism to roughly match pre-pandemic levels. ""We're hoping to accelerate that timeline as much as possible"" he said.

'We don't see tremendous movement'

Some retailers said they don't expect the lifted travel restrictions to result in an immediate jump in sales. For many companies especially those outside of the luxury space the market doesn't make up a significant chunk of their businesses. Department store chain Macy's  for example said that international tourists accounted for just about 4% of sales in 2019. Capri Holdings  which owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo believes that some international tourists will book trips to the U.S. in the coming weeks. But CEO John Idol noted on an earnings conference call on Wednesday that there was only a minor return among international tourists into Europe after travel restrictions were lifted. And there has been no return into Japan nor Korea he said. ""In our forecast we don't see tremendous movement changing our trajectory at least in next fiscal year"" Idol said. For a company like Tiffany however it could be worth the extra effort to try to court international visitors back to its U.S. stores. The jewelry chain now owned by LVMH  typically sees about 12% of sales domestically coming from foreign tourists. This holiday season Tiffany has opened a pop-up shop in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan which pays homage to the legendary Tiffany designer Jean Schlumberger. The space which features a number of Instagram friendly backdrops and activities for visitors such as painting is open to the public from Monday until Jan. 8.

It's the mall operators — some of the most challenged by stay-at-home trends in 2020 and consumers shifting into e-commerce — that say they expect to see a boon to traffic as foreigners return. ""We still think that there's another leg up if we get the international tourist that we haven't seen for a couple — two three — years"" Simon Property Group CEO David Simon told analysts on an earnings conference call held Monday. Simon's malls include The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas The Galleria mall in Houston as well as a number of premium outlet centers. Over in New Jersey the American Dream megamall is antsy for foreigners to visit. A portion of the 3 million-square-foot development first opened to the public in October 2019. But it was shut down shortly after due to pandemic restrictions. When it had first kicked open American Dream's doors in the fall of 2019 operator Triple Five Group told CNBC the megamall would draw 40 million visitors annually many of them foreigners. It has likely only since seen a sliver of that. American Dream is ramping up its efforts to court tourists to New Jersey's Meadowlands in preparation for Monday. The megamall has a team entirely dedicated to tourism that is corresponding with travel agencies and helping visitors book trips to the development. ""American Dream was always designed to be a top global tourism destination"" said Jill Renslow executive vice president of marketing at Triple Five. ""We're also working with New Jersey ... making sure we're showcasing all the things that New Jersey has to offer."" The fact that sales of clothing and footwear in New Jersey are generally tax exempt should be another appealing factor for foreign visitors to head to the state she said. Just last month the first round of luxury retailers — including Saks Fifth Avenue Hermes and Dolce & Gabbana — opened up at American Dream. These high-end shops also have their own wing within the megamall which includes a separate escalator entrance for buses that are there to transport tourists and their shopping bags. Jeweler David Yurman has laid the groundwork during the pandemic to grow its international sales. It has 45 stores in the U.S. and a handful in Canada but has partnerships with jewelry and department stores in other parts of the globe. Over the past year and a half it has launched dedicated websites in other countries and kickstarted initiatives to woo more Chinese customers David Yurman head of marketing Lee Tucker said. It started to sell a limited collection through social media and messaging app WeChat he said. Tucker said that salespeople at the jewelers' stores know how to speak numerous languages including Mandarin Arabic and Farsi so they can welcome tourists and make them feel at home. Starting this month a double-decker bus wrapped in the company's advertisement is driving to destinations like Rodeo Drive and Newport Beach where international tourists may see it and get inspired to shop. ""We're holding our breath to understand how international tourists are going to come back to our cities and which groups are going to travel here first"" he said.",,,,,,,,,

For the Daily Press

After a 9-1 season that resulted in a Mojave River League title the Oak Hills football team’s season ended at the hands of the Etiwanda via a 46-20 loss Friday night.

The Bulldogs were the 15th seed in the CIF-Southern Section Division 3 playoffs while undefeated Etiwanda was seeded second.

The same 9-1 Bulldogs that won the MRL crown did not show up on Friday night. The team uncharacteristically struggled on offense particularly in the second quarter.

“Sometimes things just don't happen the way you plan” Metzger said. “It's just one of those nights and I told the kids we got to play all four quarters throughout this playoff bracket.”

Things started on a positive note for the Bulldogs. After receiving the opening kickoff the Bulldogs put together a long drive that included two fourth-down conversions in Etiwanda territory. But on third and goal from the seven Oak Hills botched the snap and Etiwanda pounced on the ball.

The Oak Hills defense forced Etiwanda to punt following the fumble. But the Eagles intercepted Andrew Garcia on Oak Hills’ next drive to set up a short field resulting in the first score of the game a 39-yard field goal by Etiwanda’s Justin Ludovico.

The Bulldogs botched the snap on the first play of the ensuing drive ultimately resulting in a punt that only traveled 18 yards. Etiwanda took over on the Bulldogs’ 30.

Etiwanda’s Saipeti Maiava Jr. completed the ensuing 30-yard touchdown drive with a four-yard rushing touchdown.

After throwing just three interceptions all season Garcia threw another two interceptions in the first half both leading to Etiwanda touchdowns. The second of which was a 40-yard pick-six by Maiava with 30 seconds left in the first half. Maiava wound up scoring three touchdowns on the night.

Oak Hills entered halftime with a 26-0 deficit after holding Etiwanda scoreless in the first quarter.

The closest the Bulldogs would get was 19 points. Oak Hills scored back-to-back touchdowns in the third quarter to make it a 32-13 ballgame.

Senior running back Prince Thomas capped off the last Oak Hills drive of the night with a two-yard rushing touchdown.

Metzger embraced his seniors after the game and gave them a simple message.

“I'm just proud of what they've established here and what they've established for the years to come. We're going to carry on the tradition that they set for us” Metzger said.

Before the season Metzger expressed the desire to re-establish the Oak Hills culture in his first season as head coach. While the season ultimately did not end how he or his team envisioned Metzger believes that the Bulldogs accomplished that in 2021.

“There was no better first team that I could dream about coaching” Metzger said. “I'm proud of these guys how they fight every week and how they carry themselves. They helped re-establish the culture and I'm proud of them no matter the final outcome” Metzger said.

The No. 6 Bearcats stayed undefeated but it took an unbelievable finish to seal the win against a 3-5 Tulsa team. The Golden Hurricane turned the ball over on downs at the Cincinnati 2-yard line with 1:14 left and trailing by eight points but on the next play Cincinnati quarterback Desmond Ridder fumbled to give Tulsa the ball back at the 3-yard line.

But four rush attempts up the middle all went for naught including a rush by Tulsa quarterback Davis Brinn who looked to have the touchdown but slid early to be spotted a yard short. The next play Steven Anderson rushed up the middle and dove over the pile but fumbled on his way up and the Bearcats recovered in the end zone. Cincinnati won 28-20 to move to 8-0.

When the game began it seemed Cincinnati might flex its muscles on Tulsa. The Bearcats scored two touchdowns in the first quarter and kept Tulsa off the scoreboard to take an early 14-0 lead. Tulsa responded in the second by scoring 12 unanswered. Cincinnati scored 14 unanswered in the third but a fourth-quarter touchdown and two-point conversion with 8:10 left in the game by Tulsa made it a 28-20 game.

Cincinnati lasted just six plays the following drive and punted the ball back to the Golden Hurricanes giving Tulsa the ball back at its own 23-yard line with 5:28 left.

Tulsa had little issue marching down the field as it took just seven plays to get within the red zone. The Golden Hurricanes reached a 4th-and-5 at the Cincinnati 6-yard line but a 5-yard pass came up just short as Cincinnati reclaimed possession at its own 2 with 1:14 remaining.

But it didn't take long for Tulsa to get the ball right back as a botched QB sneak led to a fumble recovered by Tulsa.

Fortunately for coach Luke Fickell his defense — and a poor decision — helped his team survive the late turnover. Running back Shamari Brooks rushed ahead for two to spot the ball at the 1-yard line with 58 seconds left. Following a Cincinnati timeout he rushed for no gain. Then Brin kept the ball himself but slid to avoid the incoming tacklers. He appeared to cross the goal-line but only after the slide which spotted the ball where he began to go down bringing up fourth down.

The next play Anderson tried to leap over the pile but fumbled and Cincinnati recovered to hold on for the win.

This isn't the first time Tulsa has played a highly ranked team close. In Week 2 the Golden Hurricanes went to the fourth quarter leading Oklahoma State which is now ranked No. 11 before the Cowboys scored 21 points in the fourth quarter to win 28-23. The next week they traveled to Columbus and went into the locker rooms at halftime trailing just 13-6 to now-No. 5 Ohio State. However Ohio State scored 14 points in both the third and fourth quarters to go on to win 41-20.

Cincinnati has had the added pressure of trying to not only win but do it with style. Despite a win over No. 10 Notre Dame and an undefeated record the Bearcats' American Athletic Conference schedule has done them no favors as the College Football Playoff committee put them behind five teams three of which already had a loss.

The Bearcats might have received a bit of a boost this week. No. 3 Michigan State one of the only two undefeated teams ahead of Cincinnati lost 40-29 to unranked Purdue on Saturday all but certainly dropping the Spartans below the Bearcats in the next rankings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDE3MzUyOS9QYXVsLU1jQ2FydG5leS1yZXZlYWxzLW5ldmVyLXNlZW4tc25hcC0xOTUwcy5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTEwMTczNTI5L2FtcC9QYXVsLU1jQ2FydG5leS1yZXZlYWxzLW5ldmVyLXNlZW4tc25hcC0xOTUwcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul McCartney reveals never-before-seen snap of himself from the 1950s,"Sir Paul McCartney is waging war – on the humble passport photo.

WANDA NARA has strangely posted a throwback photo with her ex Maxi Lopez days after splitting from hubby Mauro Icardi.

The pair were involved in a public spat where she accused Icardi of allegedly cheating with an Argentine model.

Icardi thought he'd won his wife over but there has been a new twist.

Wanda's friend Yanina Latorre confirmed the couple had split telling Los Angeles de la Manana: ""Wanda Nara is separated I spoke to her [on Wednesday] morning.

""The phrase she said to me was 'I'm alone I want to be well.'

""Wanda is angry because everything was fine but then she got the email [revealing that Icardi lied about not having met China Suarez in person].""

And now Wanda has posted a pic with her ex Lopez on Instagram with a love heart and praying emoji.

Wanda left former hubby Lopez for his then team-mate Icardi and was accused of having an affair.

He only managed to get on the pitch for a minute and the game ended in a draw.

Boss Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping his striker stays laser-focussed despite his marital problems.

Argentine Pochettino described Icardi as 'a strong player psychologically' last month.

Southern on Nov. 5 said the closures include units at the two largest U.S. coal plants along with the previously announced retirement of Plant Daniel in Mississippi. Georgia Power a Southern subsidiary expects to retire about 3 GW of coal-fired generation in that state including two of the four units at the 3450-MW Plant Bowen and one at the 3500-MW Plant Scherer the nation’s largest coal plant.

The utility also said a closure would occur at the 1840-MW Plant Wansley in Georgia.

Southern CEO Tom Fanning in a call Friday with Wall Street analysts said the latest cuts mean the company will have reduced its coal-fired generation capacity by 80% since 2007. Atlanta Georgia-based Southern at one time operated 66 coal-fired generating units with capacity of nearly 20500 MW across the U.S. Southeast. The company on Friday said its current fleet comprises 18 units with 9799 MW of generation capacity.

Fanning said the closures announced Friday would leave Southern with just eight operating coal units with about 4300 MW of capacity. He said the closures would happen by 2028.

Alabama Power Cutting 3 GW

Alabama Power another Southern Co. subsidiary plans to shutter about 3000 MW of coal-fired generation including four units at Plant Gaston and one at Plant Barry and convert another unit at both Gaston and Barry to burn natural gas. The utility also Friday said its Greene County natural gas steam generator plant jointly owned by Alabama Power and Mississippi Power will close in 2025 and 2026.

More electric utilities across the U.S. are studying future plans for their coal-fired units as standards change for effluent discharges of chemicals such as arsenic mercury and selenium and utilities set carbon-reduction goals. Electric companies were required to tell the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month whether they will make new investments to keep their coal units running retire them or spend money on upgrades to meet the federal standards.

The Biden administration has called on the U.S. power industry to decarbonize operations by 2035.

Utility and environmental officials in Georgia and Alabama still need to approve Southern’s plans. Georgia Power is expected to file its next integrated resource plan (IRP) in January which will provide more details about the utility’s future generation. Alabama Power is scheduled to file its next IRP later in 2022.

Plant Daniel Closure Set for 2027

Mississippi Power in April said it would decommission the two coal units at the 1004-MW Plant Daniel in 2027. The utility at that time also confirmed it would shutter three gas-fired units in its fleet with 450 MW of generation capacity.

A closure of one unit at Plant Scherer also was previously announced. The Jacksonville (Fla.) Electric Authority (JEA) and Florida Power & Light (FPL) which owned the 848-MW Unit 4 at Plant Scherer since 1989 in June 2020 said they would close that unit after JEA’s board entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with FPL for natural gas-fired and possibly solar power generation. That generation will replace the power output from Unit 4 at Scherer.

Plant Bowen in addition to being a major U.S. coal plant also is home to a Georgia Power and Electric Power Research Institute collaborative project focused on finding uses for recycled coal combustion products or CCPs. The Ash Beneficial Use Center hosts pilot projects and lead testing to develop technology for the use of coal ash in commercial applications.

On Saturday 42-year-old Mary MacCarthy spoke to PEOPLE about the Oct. 22 incident that left her and her 10-year-old daughter Moira ""traumatized.""

After learning that her brother Michael who served as a father figure to her daughter died unexpectedly at the age of 46 from a blood clot the pair took a plane from Los Angeles to Denver with a layover in San Jose Calif.

At first the single mom explained they were unable to find seats together on the flight from San Jose to Denver.

She asked flight attendants if they could help her and her daughter find a pair of seats next to each other. ""I said to the flight attendants 'We're traveling for a funeral my daughter's just 10.'""

Mary McCarthy

MacCarthy a former TV reporter said the flight crew told her to ""just find two open seats."" She said she took it upon herself to see if anyone was willing to trade seats and the other passengers were accommodating.

After that minor hiccup the flight seemed routine. However upon touchdown in Denver MacCarthy revealed she was caught off guard when a Southwest Airlines employee and two police officers were waiting for the pair on the jet bridge.

""I was confronted by two armed police officers. One started speaking to me the other to my daughter. I was really confused because they seemed to know our names"" she recalled.

At first MacCarthy explained that she thought another member of her family had died and that police were there to break the news.

Instead they said: ""'We're here to talk to you because you and your daughter were reported as having suspicious behavior.' At that point in my mind it clicked that we had probably been profiled. I've been raising this girl for 10 years; she's my biological daughter and I knew things like this could happen.""

MacCarthy recorded the nearly three-minute interaction with police and the Southwest employee in which she and her daughter sound noticeably shaken up. Moira can also be heard crying.

In the video the employee told MacCarthy ""The flight attendants were just concerned about the behavior when you boarded the aircraft"" and that it was company policy to follow up on the claims.

The employee explained a flight attendant had alerted police of suspicious activity between the mom and daughter because they were the last people to board the flight and asked other passengers to switch seats.

MacCarthy said if she and Moira had the same skin color this never would have been an issue. ""I was upset about it because I was certain we had been racially profiled"" she recalled.

Southwest Airlines did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

MacCarthy told PEOPLE that 10 days after the incident she got a call from the police saying that they were ""following up on suspicions that I'm a human trafficker.""

According to police reports the employee suspected her of human trafficking because the pair boarded the flight last-minute and MacCarthy demanded that they sit next to each other. The employee also claimed ""the mom and daughter did not talk during the flight"" and the mother ""did not allow the child to talk to flight crew.""

MacCarthy said these claims were untrue and that the human trafficking suspicion completely blindsided her as police at the time weren't transparent about the suspicious activity she was being accused of. Now she said she's pursuing legal action.

""I want Southwest Airlines and the Denver police to be held accountable for what is undoubtedly a case of racial profiling involving a 10-year-old black girl who was already suffering the worst day in her life — a death in her family"" MacCarthy stated.

""An incident like this can scar a child for life"" said MacCarthy who is currently looking into getting her daughter a therapist. She vows to ""never set foot on a Southwest plane again.""

In a statement issued to PEOPLE attorney David Lane explained ""Had the child been white there is absolutely no doubt that this would never have occurred. Thus far my investigation reveals no misconduct by the police as they were merely making an inquiry based upon a Southwest Airline's complaint and they are allowed to investigate. It is the 'Corporate Karen' who is to blame for this. I have reached out to Southwest legal counsel and have heard nothing. This is a civil rights violation and absent some appropriate response by the airline we will proceed to file in federal court.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIxL25vdi8wNi9taXhlZC1yYWNlLWZhbWlseS1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtaHVtYW4tdHJhZmZpY2tpbmctc3VzcGVjdGVk0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjEvbm92LzA2L21peGVkLXJhY2UtZmFtaWx5LXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1odW1hbi10cmFmZmlja2luZy1zdXNwZWN0ZWQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mixed-race family call for apology after Southwest staff raise trafficking concern,"A mixed-race family has demanded an apology from Southwest Airlines after a flight attendant flagged them as suspicious wrongly assuming the white mother was trafficking her biracial child.

Mary MacCarthy said her 10-year-old daughter Moira now “clams up” when they talk about how an airline employee and two police officers questioned them after their flight landed in Denver on 22 October.

“The whole thing is based on what I believe to be a racist assumption about a mixed-race family” MacCarthy told the Denver Post.

After MacCarthy’s brother died she and Moira traveled last-minute to Denver from Los Angeles – with a connection through San Jose – in order to attend the funeral. MacCarthy a single mom said her brother had been a father figure to Moira.

McCarthy said she and her daughter were shocked and sleep deprived when they boarded the plane to Denver last because they were in the final boarding group. Onboard other passengers moved so they would not have to be apart. MacCarthy tried to sleep while Moira listened to an audiobook.

When MacCarthy got off the plane in Denver and noticed the officers waiting she said she panicked terrified another family member had died.

But it turned out a flight attendant suspected her of human trafficking after she and Moira boarded last and asked others to switch seats so they could sit together.

The attendant claimed she never saw MacCarthy and Moira speak and that MacCarthy warned her daughter not to talk with the flight crew NBC News reported.

MacCarthy denied that and said she and her daughter were “deeply traumatized by the assumption that just because we don’t have the same skin color we’re involved in a very serious crime”.

In video of the confrontation with police officers Moira can be heard wailing while MacCarthy tries to explain why she and her daughter are traveling.

“It’s OK sweetheart” MacCarthy tells Moira.

“She doesn’t need to be scared” an officer says. “Because you are not in any trouble whatsoever OK?”

MacCarthy later tells the officers and a Southwest employee Moira “has already unfortunately been traumatized by the police in her life”.

A police report said the incident was “unfounded” according to NBC News. But MacCarthy still received a follow-up call from a human trafficking unit investigator.

“Had this little girl been white there would have been not a raised eyebrow” MacCarthy’s lawyer David Lane told NBC. “So race was the only factor that triggered this call to the police.

“It’s Southwest Airlines that I have an issue with. And I think this is a civil rights violation because they are causing a paying customer of theirs to have to undergo the trauma of being stopped by the police.”

Southwest told NBC it was “conducting a review of the situation internally” and “will be reaching out to the customer to address her concerns and offer our apologies for her experience traveling with us”.

A spokesperson told SFGate staff “undergo robust training on human trafficking”.

Other mixed-race families have been flagged as suspicious while traveling. A man on another Southwest flight was suspected of trafficking his adopted Chinese daughter on the way home from a trip to Florida. A Black woman flying Frontier Airlines with her white adoptive sister was questioned in Dallas.

MacCarthy told SFGate she travels with Moira’s birth certificate so she is “prepared for any questions”. She also said she understood the job of the Transportation Security Administration was to make sure they were “traveling under the proper circumstances”.

But that was different from “being accosted by armed police and being told that we’ve been acting suspiciously” she said. “That’s not the same thing at all.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbGxpbmdoYW1oZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZTI1NTYyODQxMS5odG1s0gFEaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYmVsbGluZ2hhbWhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlMjU1NjI4NDExLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With some fanfare Southwest Airlines kicks off daily flights out of Bellingham,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bellinghamherald.com', port=443): Read timed out.

A California woman is accusing Southwest Airlines of racial profiling saying she was accused of human trafficking while traveling with her biracial daughter.

Mary MacCarthy of Los Angeles told CNN she and her 10-year-old daughter Moira were flying to Denver on October 22 after receiving news that MacCarthy’s brother had suddenly died.

MacCarthy said they had a brief stop in San Jose and boarded another Southwest flight but realized then that they couldn’t be seated together.

“I asked flight attendants if we could be seated together but they told us we’d each have to take a middle seat” MacCarthy said. “So with their permission I asked other passengers if they would kindly move so we could be together especially as my daughter was grieving and they did. People are nice.”

When they arrived in Denver MacCarthy said she and her daughter were met on the jetway by two Denver police officers.

“I got quite a shock; having lost my brother the night before I thought that someone else in my family had died and that police had been sent to deliver the news!” MacCarthy wrote in an email to Southwest Airlines’ media team which was included in the police report.

“As for my daughter she was terribly frightened: she was already experiencing the trauma of her uncle’s death and she is scared of police due to constant headlines about how police treat Black people (she is Black). She began to sob and was inconsolable” her email said.

The officers assured her nothing was wrong but said they wanted to question her and her daughter MacCarthy said.

“They said they were here because my daughter and I were reported for suspicious behavior acting suspiciously before boarding and while boarding” she said.

“I took out my phone and immediately started recording. I told (the officer) who we were and that my daughter was crying because she had lost a family member” MacCarthy said.

According to a report from the Denver police “Both Mother and child were cleared.”

The report also noted that officers were responding to a “possible Human Trafficking reported by South West flight attendant” — but MacCarthy says she only found out two weeks later that she was suspected of human trafficking.

“I got a call from Denver Police human trafficking unit letting me know they were following up on the incident” she told CNN.

CNN reached out to the Denver Police Department on Sunday afternoon about MacCarthy’s claim but has not received a response.

MacCarthy accuses Southwest Airlines of racial profiling. She says she’s retained an attorney and wants the airline to be held “fully accountable.”

“I gave the airline plenty of time to contact me and apologize — over two weeks later I’ve yet to receive anything more than two brief automated responses. The time for an apology is long past” MacCarthy said.

In her email to Southwest’s media team MacCarthy said she wanted a written apology from the airline immediate reimbursement of the full price of their tickets and “additional compensation to account for the trauma imposed on an innocent family and especially on a grieving ten year-old Black girl.”

Southwest Airlines said it is “disheartened” by MacCarthy’s account of the events and plans to reach out to her.

“We are conducting a review of the situation internally and we will be reaching out to the Customer to address her concerns and offer our apologies for her experience traveling with us. Our Employees undergo robust training on Human Trafficking. Above all Southwest Airlines prides itself on providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for the millions of Customers who travel with us each year” Southwest Airlines spokesperson Dan Landson said in a statement to CNN on Sunday.

“Had this been a White child there would not have been a raised eyebrow” MacCarthy’s attorney David Lane told CNN.

I’d know that voice anywhere it’s Southwest gate agent Scott in Phoenix.

Two years ago I landed there and he sand a stylized version of the theme from Golden Girls (“Thank You For Being a Friend”) as “Thank you for flying Southwest.” In song he even promised you wouldn’t be dragged off a plane like David Dao

You won’t be dragged off our plane today no matter who you are if you’re on you’re on to stay.

BUFFALO N.Y. — If you noticed that Buffalo-area Starbucks locations closed early Saturday there's a reason for it.

Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was scheduled to speak to local Starbucks workers from 5 to 7 p.m. at the downtown Hyatt Regency Buffalo according to organizers trying to start a local Starbucks union.

Buffalo-area Starbucks closed at 3 p.m. on Saturday. Schultz issued a statement on Saturday titled ""From Buffalo with love."" In the post he detailed what he hoped to do during his visit to Western New York.

""Since my last trip here to meet with Store Managers in September I have had the great privilege of hearing deeply personal stories about our Buffalo partners’ own journeys"" Schultz said.

""My purpose here has been to listen and learn. And to share with our partners – so many here who are new to the company – about the values and principles that have served as our foundation.""

Starbucks employees posted signs around the venue. A man was later seen removing those signs. No media was allowed in the building.

The Starbucks Workers United posted Saturday afternoon on Twitter that it learned of Schultz's planned appearance through a video sent to workers by Deanna Pusatier who serves as a regional director of operations It was also shared on social media.

""Hey partners super excited to see you at our partner event on Saturday"" Pusatier says in the video. ""Oh and I just found out who our special guest is. It's our very own Howard Schultz. See you there.""

Workers attempting to form a Starbucks union posted news of Schultz's appearance on Twitter.

""In thirty minutes Starbucks is shutting down all of its Buffalo stores telling partners to go to an event with Howard Schultz. How do the shareholders feel about losing all that revenue in what is typically our most profitable launch/earnings quarter?"" the post said.

Union elections for the Elmwood Avenue Camp Road and Genesee Street locations will vote using mail ballots starting Wednesday and running through Dec. 8.

A Starbucks spokesperson told 2 On Your Side last week in part that they remain focused on supporting their partners as well as maintaining open transparent and direct conversations throughout the process. The company is evaluating its options.

A week after the three locations mentioned above announced they would like to unionize two more expressed interest in unionizing as well. Those locations were at Walden and Anderson in Cheektowaga and at Transit Commons.

As the festive hot drink season gets underway almost all the major coffee chains have released their offerings for 2021 – from the return of firm favourites to Quality Street-inspired lattes to a Fudge Brownie Hot Chocolate.

But it’s often difficult to keep track of and compare which ones are packing the largest amount of sugar.

In 2019 Action on Sugar said the festive drink with the highest amount of sugar was Starbucks’ Signature Caramel Hot Chocolate with whipped cream using Oat Milk in a venti size which reportedly had over 23 teaspoons of sugar.

But what about this year? Have any of the brands made their drinks healthier or gone the other way and added more sugar? We’ve whipped together a comprehensive comparison for you - the numbers are based on grande sizes and having semi-skimmed milk in your drink.

We can reveal that from the drinks featured on online menus Costa’s old favourite Gingerbread Latte drink has the lowest sugar content while Caffé Nero’s festive hot chocolate range tops the scale once again.

Here’s a breakdown of our findings:

Costa

The chain appears to have significantly reduced the sugar in the old favourite Gingerbread Latte (with cream). Last year we found that the in-store version of the drink (356ml) had 24.9g of sugar while the takeaway version (376ml) had 25.8g.

However according to the nutritional values available on the Costa menu online the Gingerbread Latte now has 13.6g and 14.5g of sugar respectively making it the festive drink with the lowest sugar content. Last year this position was held by the Black Forest Hot Chocolate which has 28.9g for an in-store drink and 31.8g in a takeaway drink.

Costa has added a new drink to its festive menu which also has the highest sugar content among its other drinks. The new Quality Street Toffee Penny Latte with Light Dairy Swirl contains 40.1g of sugar in the 379ml in-store drink and 41.1g in the 399ml takeaway drink.

Both the Terry’s Chocolate Orange Hot Chocolate and the Quality Street Purple One Latte have 35.4g of sugar in the in-store drinks and 36.4g in the takeaway options while the After Eight Hot Chocolate has 34.3g of sugar in an in-store drink and 37.2g in the takeaway size.

Greggs

Greggs’ Mint Hot Chocolate contains 43g of sugar per 412ml serving while its Salted Caramel Latte contains 27g of sugar in a 366ml serving.

The chain has also added a Mint Mocha drink to its festive offerings which has 36g of sugar per 430g serving.

You can see the full Greggs menu here.

( Greggs )

Caffé Nero

Caffe Nero’s Salted Caramel Latte contains more sugar this year compared to last year with 33.4g of sugar in its grande offering compared to 28.3g last year. In comparison the Gingerbread Latte contains 23.8g.

But this pales in comparison to the Mint Hot Chocolate which boasts 63.8g of sugar per grande serving while the Hazelnut Hot Chocolate has 60.3g.

Starbucks

Starbucks has introduced two new drinks to its festive menu including the Fudge Brownie Hot Chocolate and the Caramel Waffle Latte. The former contains 51.4g of sugar while the latter has 37g.

The chain has also brought its popular Toffee Nut Latte back for the festive season which contains 20.1g of sugar per grande serving.

You can also buy other classic seasonal drinks such as the Egg Nog Latte which contains 41.4g of sugar and the Gingerbread Latte with 25g of sugar.

Pret A Manger

Pret’s festive menu has not yet been released. Last year the Salted Caramel Latte contained 29.5g of sugar while the Gingerbread Latte had 26g.

The S’Mores Hot Chocolate – which contains biscuit syrup – contained 42.5g of sugary deliciousness. All festive drinks from Pret come in a 12oz cup.

With the goal of attracting mothers and working parents Amazon announced this week that workers in certain roles ranging from warehouse to delivery can cancel a shift “in as little as 16 hours” before it begins or can swap shifts with other employees at the last minute. Meanwhile Starbucks is testing a “shifts app” aimed at making it easier for employees to work available shifts to meet their personal needs. (The latter also comes as Starbucks baristas in New York state are looking to unionize.)

In recent years employers including Walmart began to offer more job flexibility amid the tight US labor market and a growing number of companies have followed. Job postings offering “flexibility” jumped from 6.4% in 2016 to 20% in 2021 according to data from ZipRecruiter. Flexibility is becoming more of a norm for all jobs in the US—and that has accelerated during the pandemic.

In a tight labor market traditional work-site employers are now competing against the growing number of remote-friendly companies says Julia Pollak a chief economist at ZipRecruiter. For instance call centers which before the pandemic required workers to make calls from a central location are now allowing them to make their calls from home. Even at jobs that require workers to be on-site some employers are allowing workers to complete administrative tasks at home she adds.

“As a result the on-site employers are having to somehow sweeten the pot and offer a little bit more flexibility because they’re losing huge numbers of workers to employers who are more flexible” she says. “If they can’t compete on space they’re competing on time.”

The unpredictable nature of low-wage jobs

Historically flexibility was not on the employee’s side. A 2015 study from the University of Chicago found retail workers reported concerns about short notice of their work schedules and unpredictable changes which would interfere with child care and other aspects of home life and contributed to turnover. Over three-fourths of both part-time and full-time employees reported receiving one week or less notice of the days and hours they would need to work according to the study.

Scheduling software focused on boosting company’s revenues such as Walmart’s in 2007 which moved workers from predictable hours to when there was customer demand. That led to workers feeling like they have no control over their schedule. In 2014 Starbucks baristas voiced objections to a system that forced them to work shifts with only a few hours break between them. Their resentment forced the coffee chain to make their scheduling practices more employee-friendly such as by preventing managers from booking employees to work shifts with less than eight hours in between.

The systems have gotten more sophisticated by integrating with software like Slack and Facebook Messenger to make communication more seamless says Jayson Saba a senior director of product management at UKG a global HR and workforce management company. The pandemic forced wider adoption.

But given how companies have used them in the past some are still skeptical of the updated scheduling practices. “Flexibility is a buzzword which really means last minute scheduling and unpredictable lives for low-wage earners” said Stuart Appelbaum president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union in an email to Quartz. “The rise of this practice is just the latest cover for long-standing scheduling issues which leave workers in precarious positions. Without fair scheduling practices workers cannot plan their lives take care of their children or elderly parents take a necessary second job or seek additional training or courses to advance their careers.”

A number of cities including San Francisco Seattle and New York City have established scheduling laws with universal standards for scheduling hourly workers in industries like retail food service and hospitality.

When the labor shortage eases the benefit could disappear says Ruth Milkman a professor at the City University of New York’s School of Labor and Urban Studies. “All that said this is definitely something workers care about… so even if it’s only due to the current labor shortage it’s good to see some effort to address it however limited” she says.

The future of low-wage work is more flexibility?

Amazon the second largest employer in the US tends to set the bar for what other low-wage employers provide their workers. The company—which raised its average hourly US wages to $18 an hour—is struggling to attract workers and in its most recent earnings call mentioned how it is spending a lot more to overcome supply chain difficulties. Flexible scheduling can help make employers like Amazon more attractive says Saba.

“Everyone is getting paid pretty much the same in these types of jobs no matter where they go” he says. “So it’s not a money piece anymore. How are we going to differentiate and how are we going to adapt to meet that? It comes down to that.”

Overall the pandemic is forcing employers to streamline their hiring process by improving how they post and advertise job postings says Pollak. “When you have to learn to attract workers in a tight labor market you have to just improve as an employer and be a better employer” she says. “And once you’ve made those improvements I don’t think you dial them back.”

It’s still in the early days but the improvements in conditions and wages of jobs that need to be done on-site can unlock huge potential for these workers. At the same time when companies switch to more flexible scheduling they often don’t see employees working less resulting in everybody working shifts that make them happier with no overall decline in productivity and higher retention says Pollak.

“It’s an exciting shift” she says. “Whenever you have this huge shift of winners and losers and the losers need to play catch up and figure out what to do it can improve outcomes for everybody.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGhpbHN0YXJsaWZlLmNvbS9saXZpbmcvODExNDk4LXByZXR0eS1pbi1waW5rLXN0YXJidWNrcy1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy1zaWduZWQtc2VhbGVkLWRlbGl2ZXJlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pretty in pink: Starbucks Philippines launches Christmas merch featuring Santa Bear and friends,"Hey Starbucks lovers!

NKyTribune sports reporter

During a home volleyball match this season St. Henry celebrated the 40th anniversary of the 1981 team winning the high school’s first state championship in a non-classified sport. That ceremony motivated this year’s team to do it again.

St. Henry defeated Louisville Mercy 21-15 21-18 21-14 in the state tournament final on Saturday at George Rogers Clark High School to add another state championship trophy to the school’s collection.

“We’ve said all year ‘It’s time that we bring it back’ and we did” said Crusaders coach Maureen Kaiser who was a freshman on St. Henry’s junior varsity volleyball team in 1981.

“I can’t even put it into words. It’s been a magical dream. I have seven seniors that knew what job we had to do and took it and ran with it.”

St. Henry has won several All “A” Classic state championships in volleyball but the Crusaders became the first small-school to win the unclassified post-season tournament title since their 1981 team.

In the semifinals on Saturday morning St. Henry defeated Louisville Sacred Heart the top-ranked team in the final state coaches poll to reach the state championship match for the first time since 2006. Louisville Mercy returned to the state final after losing to Notre Dame in five sets last year.

In the first set of the state final the Crusaders jumped out to an 8-2 lead behind four kills by senior middle hitter Taylor Preston to seize the momentum that carried them to victory in all three sets.

Preston registered 25 kills in the three-set sweep to lead a St. Henry attack that had a .430 hitting percentage compared to Mercy’s .247. Sophomore outside hitter Alivia Skidmore had 16 kills with no errors and senior setter Cora Taylor notched 42 assists for the Crusaders.

St. Henry grabbed the first four points of the third set and never looked back. In a stanza that featured five runs of at least three straight points the Crusaders completed their bid for a state title with a kill by Skidmore.

“Cora Taylor reads the defense so well and just plays the ball in the hitters’ hands” coach Kaiser said. “Our defense Abby Schaefer and Elizabeth Tabeling both were passing on a dime on that run and it just allowed our offense to run.”

Preston was named the state tournament’s most valuable player. The Oklahoma University recruit totaled 67 kills with a .358 hitting percentage in her team’s three state tournament victories on Friday and Saturday.

Taylor and Schaefer a senior libero were the other St. Henry players named to the state all-tournament team. Taylor had 121 assists and Schaefer had 44 digs in 10 sets over the weekend.

“It’s all on them. They worked their tails off all year” Kaiser said of her team’s effort.

In the semifinal match against Sacred Heart neither team led by more than four points in the first set before a late rally by the Valkyries carried them to a 25-23 victory.

St. Henry went on a 7-1 run midway through the second set and evened the match with a 25-11 decision. In the third set Sacred Heart jumped out to 8-1 lead. The Crusaders mounted a comeback to tie the score at 22-22 and won it 26-24 on a Preston kill.

Sacred Heart held set point at 25-24 in the fourth set but St. Henry responded with three straight points for a 27-25 win and advanced to the championship match on a kill by junior outside hitter Sidney Arstingstall.

The final stats for the semifinal match showed Preston with 27 kills. Skidmore added 15 kills and 14 digs with Taylor assisting on 48 points. Approximately seven hours later the Crusaders won the championship match to finish the season with a 36-8 record.

“Our legs were tired but honestly we had enough time in between our morning game and we went back and took a nap got refueled” Kaiser said.

According to the State Patrol around 11:30 p.m. a state trooper encountered a Honda Accord that was preparing to exit from a parking lot in the wrong direction onto Concordia Avenue. The driver then made a U-turn and started heading east on Concordia driving slowly while taking up two lanes before entering a closed construction zone near Hamline Avenue.

The driver identified as a woman in her 70s stepped out of the car and walked toward the trooper. She tried to get back in her car ""after a brief interaction"" but the trooper tried to stop her. She then showed what seemed to be a handgun and pointed it at the trooper the State Patrol said. The woman then got back in her car and drove away.

The St. Paul Police Department later found the Accord abandoned at the intersection of St. Anthony Avenue and Pascal Street just across the interstate from where she encountered the state trooper. The driver was spotted on the Pascal Street bridge over I-94.

I-94 was then closed down from Lexington Parkway to Snelling Avenue for hours ""in the interest of public safety"" the State Patrol said.

The woman was eventually arrested and it was found that the handgun was not real.

She was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and will later be booked into the Ramsey County Jail on suspicion of threats of violence second-degree assault fleeing police in a motor vehicle and driving while impaired.

The incident remains under investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aWNrZWRsb2NhbC5jb20vc3RvcnkvaGVyYWxkLWNpdGl6ZW4vMjAyMS8xMS8wNy9wb3dlcmVkLXR3by1zdGF0ZXMtdG9wLWRpc3RhbmNlLXRhbGVudHMtc3Qtam9obnMtZGFudmVycy1jcm9zcy1jb3VudHJ5LXN0aWxsLXJlbGllcy1uZXh0LW1lbi11cC82MjM5NjcwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Owning two of the state's top runners St. John's Prep harriers still rely on entire cast,"Chad Konecky

Special to Wicked Local

In sports like soccer and basketball it’s called “ball-watching” and it’s not a good thing. The term is usually lobbed at teams that boast one or two generational talents upon whom teammates have become too reliant on to produce wins all on their own.

Players become spectators as opposed to contributors. Whatever the equivalent term is in distance running – perhaps back-of-the-jersey watching? – there’s no such dynamic at work on the St. John’s Prep of Danvers cross-country roster.

“We have two superb athletes in junior Nathan Lopez (Lynnfield) and senior Charlie Tuttle (Salem) but those two guys cannot win a team title as a duo” says Eagles cross-country assistant coach Zach Lankow a 2007 St. John’s Prep graduate.

“The depth pieces of this crew understand the importance of their position from a larger picture and the reality is we have needed them to contribute on a level they had not yet been asked to do entering this season.”

To that point that formula has worked like clockwork. The Prep is 5-0 in dual-meet competitions while winning Rhode Island’s Ocean State Invitational in September a race featuring 12 teams from four states in which all five Eagles scorers finished in the top 35.

Late last month the Prep cruised to the Catholic Conference Cross-Country Classic crown. Sandwiched in between St. John’s also won the Massachusetts State Track Coaches Association Bay State Invitational as well as the Manhattan College Cross-Country Invitational.

“Although we have two really good guys at the top of our roster you can’t win a race with only two runners” says senior Luc Santos (Exeter N.H.). “You need at least five scorers to win. Our team is fairly balanced and our coaches have trained us very well to create a great well-balanced mix even if two of our guys are a bit better than most runners in the state.”

“I think the entire team pushes each other in workouts it’s about more than Nate and Charlie running fast up front” agrees junior Paul Lovett (North Andover).

“We all work really well together in practice to try and make each other better. That said being able to train with two of the fastest guys in the state is highly beneficial because if I can be close to those two I know I can run fast too.”

Yes he can. As can Santos along with consistent scorers like juniors Felix Rogovin (Topsfield) and Jack Stein (Marblehead). Lovett for example clocked a 5K personal-best 16:40.90 in finishing 13th in the MSTCA Red Race last month while Stein also had a personal best in that race crossing the line in 12th place 0.70 seconds ahead of Lovett. In Rhode Island Lovett took 12th 10 seconds ahead of Stein’s 19th-place finish. Talk about fierce intra-squad competition.

Rogovin meanwhile has also had a personal best this fall taking 25th in Rhode Island with a time of 17:00.60. He finished just behind Lovett and ahead of Santos and Stein at the 2.5-mile Manhattan College course in New York.

“The best thing about being on a team with such depth is you can’t get complacent and you always have to fight for your spot” says Rogovin. “Being able to train with Charlie and Nate every day has been amazing because it really motivates everyone. It’s also really helped my development as a racer because I’m used to any type of competition now since I train with a group of guys who are all very competitive with each other.”

All four depth guys bring their own unique sensibility to the gestalt of the 2021 Eagles. Lovett is a meticulous student of the sport and racing tactics. Rogovin is the vocal energizer bunny at practice. Santos and Stein are poised grinders whose heavy mileage is paying big dividends.

“Paul Felix Luc and Jack are the difference-makers from a competition standpoint” says Lankow. “We graduated some talented athletes over the past two years and these guys learned by example and they’ve capably filled their respective roles on the team. (Lovett and Stein) were freshmen when we won the 2019 state title and (Santos) was a sophomore. They saw what it took for that team to perform at the level it did how it handled adversity and how to grow as teammates. Now that they have the opportunity to do so I’m thrilled with the challenge they’ve met and progress they’ve made.”

While the Eagles have indeed met every challenge over the past two months the mettle of the schedule starts this week. The MSTCA Coaches Invitational this Saturday (Nov. 6) will serve as a final tune-up for the MIAA EMass Division 1 Championships on Nov. 13 followed by the All-State Championship Meet on Nov. 20.

Time will tell if either Lopez or Tuttle can win an individual state title in 2021 but what we do know is the Eagles stand no chance of winning it all as a team unless the squad’s four workhorses keep churning up the turf and scoring high finishes.

St. Joseph's will now start a new streak and time will only tell how long it will last.

""I think that happening made us even more determined to win this. Our road through the playoffs was not easy"" Carino said. ""We won in three but they were not blowouts. We didn't blow teams off the court. Every year all of the teams are getting better so it's always a competition.""

After North Central tied the match 2-2 for a moment last year's quarterfinals lingered in Dreher High School's gymnasium.

St. Joseph fell to start the match 25-20 but rebounded the next two sets 25-18 28-26. North Central still had a fight left in them and claimed the fourth set 25-18.

""After the fourth set I don't know what happened. We disappeared and that happens sometimes but wow their No. 2. She served us out of the gate"" Carino said.

The Knights road to state included defeating every opponent 3-0: In round one Christ Church (25-17 25-17 25-10); round two Crescent (25- 20 25-15 25-23); round three Andrew Jackson (25-13 25-16 25-16); and in round four Liberty (25- 17 25-18 25-20).

Saturday was a battle between junior Emily Normand and Alayna Johnson. Each team knew who its offensive weapons were and played their cards right.

""I knew going in that they were going to have their strong hitter we have our strong hitter"" Carino said. ""I feel like we have a few more weapons than they did. We knew they were going to go to No. 2 (Alayna Johnson) as much as they possibly could. We mainly used Emily … it was Emily vs. No. 2.""

Senior libero Maggie Peterson created the opportunity for setter Kimmie Thompson to make the last kill of the match for the Knights to beat North Central 3-2 and 15-6 in the fifth set and claim the Class AA 2021 state championship.

In Carino's 22 coaching career the Knights have won their 10th state championship in the last 11 years.

Carino said winning state championships never gets old and neither does the love that she has for her players each year.

""It's funny because I have a lot of people ask me how long are you going to keep coaching? I love coaching and every year I have a group of girls that come through and there's another group coming up and I want to stay and coach that group"" Carino said. ""The girls that I work with are such great kids that they just keep me coming back.""

The Knights will lose seven seniors after this season: defensive specialists Kate Lyons Evy Lane and Abby Shafer opposite hitters Maja Hawthorne and Tatum Hecker setter Kimmie Thompson and Patterson.

""We have seven seniors on this team so for us to get this championship for those seven seniors means the most"" Carino said.

How will Carino keep the dominance consistent? Carino said the work the players do outside of St. Joseph's and fun will keep the program strong.

""I have to give credit to the clubs that they are coached from because it's not all me. They play for some top teams and then they come to me and I'm like 'okay we need to figure out how are we going to put this group together' "" Carino said.

""We do a lot of team bonding off the court. I try to make practice enjoyable. we compete in practice a lot. and I just want them to look forward to coming to practice and that is one of my goals."""

When they get worried these days their concerns are about phenomena that are well-known at this point like the Delta variant and supply chain snags.

But Michael Wilson chief investment officer and chief US equity strategist for Morgan Stanley says there is still an economic slowdown coming — and investors who think it's going to be short-lived are missing the boat.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""We have been expecting a material slowdown in both economic and earnings growth amid a mid cycle transition"" he wrote in a recent note to clients. ""The Delta variant is not the primary reason why growth has slowed in our view. Instead we think it's simply a more dramatic mid cycle transition than normal given the speed and velocity of the recovery so far.""

He also writes that the supply chain problems will last longer than most traders expect and demand from consumers is going to be weaker than they believe.

""We think the growth slowdown will be worse and last longer than expected — i.e. well into the first half of 2022 as the payback in demand arrives with the sharp y/y decline in personal disposable income"" he said.

It's well-known that Americans built up a lot of savings during COVID thanks to stimulus payments and the absence of many forms of non-streaming entertainment and leisure. While some prognosticators think those savings will keep the economy afloat for a while Wilson says the money has been spent and consumers are roughly back to pre-pandemic savings levels now.

He added that a survey by National Public Radio and Harvard found that 59% of households with less than $50000 in annual income reported severe financial problems in the last few months while 38% of all households said the same.

That helps explain a recent dip in consumer confidence and it could mean people are about to spend far less than investors think they will. Wilson suggests that that's a setup for economic and stock market disappointment even before factoring in the supply chain issues and other problems.

""A key message from us over the next several weeks is to stay selective and to stay more defensive in terms of positioning"" Wilson wrote. ""We continue to like relatively reasonably priced Software over Hardware and Semis in Tech Services over Goods in Discretionary Financials and Healthcare.""

That creates a more defensive portfolio with less supply chain risk he said. At the same time he updated his firm's Fresh Money Buy List by removing tech giant Alphabet.

""GOOGL has been a top performer since the end of March. Not only has it outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 20% but it's been the best performing FANG stock over that period leaving less relative upside at this point"" he wrote adding Snap's recent weak earnings might make the market quick to dump Google stock.

That leaves the following nine companies on the list of Buy-rated long-term outperformers which in line with Wilson's ideas has developed a notable skew toward real estate.",,,,,,,,,

The full-scale outline of a U.S. carrier and at least two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are part of the target range that has been built in the Ruoqiang region in central China. The site is near a former target range China used to test early versions of its so-called carrier killer DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles according to press reports in 2013.

This new range shows that China continues to focus on anti-carrier capabilities with an emphasis on U.S. Navy warships. Unlike the Iranian Navy’s aircraft carrier-shaped target in the Persian Gulf the new facility shows signs of a sophisticated instrumented target range.

The carrier target itself appears to be a flat surface without the carrier’s island aircraft lifts weapons sponsons or other details the imagery from Maxar shows. On radar the outline of the carrier stands out from the surrounding desert – not unlike a target picture according to imagery provided to USNI News by Capella Space.

There are two more target areas representing an aircraft carrier that do not have the metaling but are distinguishable as carriers due to their outline. But other warship targets appear to be more elaborate. There are numerous upright poles positioned on them possibly for instrumentation according to the imagery. Alternatively these may be used for radar reflectors to simulate the superstructure of the vessel.

The facility also has an extensive rail system. An Oct. 9 image from Maxar showed a 75 meter-long target with extensive instrumentation on a 6 meter-wide rail.

The area has been traditionally used for ballistic missile testing according to a summary of the Maxar images by geospatial intelligence company AllSource Analysis that identified the site from satellite imagery.

“The mockups of several probable U.S. warships along with other warships (mounted on rails and mobile) could simulate targets related to seeking/target acquisition testing” according to the AllSource Analysis summary which said there are no indications of weapon impact areas in the immediate vicinity of the mockups. “This and the extensive detail of the mockups including the placement of multiple sensors on and around the vessel targets it is probable that this area is intended for multiple uses over time.“

Analysis of historical satellite images shows that the carrier target structure was first built between March and April of 2019. It underwent several rebuilds and was then substantially dismantled in December 2019. The site came back to life in late September of this year and the structure was substantially complete by early October.

China has several anti-ship ballistic missile programs overseen by the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force. The land-based CSS-5 Mod 5 (DF-21D) missile has a range of over 800 nautical miles. It has a maneuverable reentry vehicle (MaRV) to target ships. The larger CSS-18 (DF-26) has a range of around 2000 nautical miles.

“In July 2019 the PLARF conducted its first-ever confirmed live-fire launch into the South China Sea firing six DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles into the waters north of the Spratly Islands” according to the Pentagon’s latest annual report on China’s military. The Chinese are also fielding a longer range anti-ship ballistic missile that initially emerged in 2016.

“The multi-role DF-26 is designed to rapidly swap conventional and nuclear warheads and is capable of conducting precision land-attack and anti-ship strikes in the Western Pacific the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea from mainland China. In 2020 the PRC fired anti-ship ballistic missiles against a moving target in the South China Sea but has not acknowledged doing so” reads the report.

In addition to the land-based anti-ship ballistic missiles China has a program to equip the People’s Liberation Army Navy H-6 bombers with a massive anti-ship ballistic missile. First revealed in 2018 the CH-AS-X-13 will likely be the largest air-launched missile in existence and would be large enough to accommodate a hypersonic warhead.

Another possible launch platform for anti-ship ballistic missiles is the new Type-055 Renhai Class large destroyer. Described as a guided-missile cruiser it will be capable of carrying anti-ship ballistic missiles according to the Pentagon report.

It’s not the first time China has built an aircraft carrier target in the desert. Since 2003 a large concrete pad roughly the size of a carrier has been used as a target. The slab which is part of the Shuangchengzi missile test range has been hit many times and is frequently repaired. The new site in the Taklamakan desert is 600 miles away and is much more evolved. The newer ship targets are closer approximations of the vessels that they are supposed to represent.

While questions remain on the extent of weapons that will be tested at the new facility the level of sophistication of what can now be seen at the site show the PLA is continuing to invest in deterrents to limit the efficacy of U.S. naval forces close to China – in particular targeting the U.S. carrier fleet.

PUEBLO Colo. – PBR (Professional Bull Riders) today announced that the PBR Team Series a new league launching in June 2022 will hold its playoffs and championship in Las Vegas a city that has been instrumental to the sport’s growth and success.

Electric vehicle maker Rivian makes its public market debut on Wednesday in one of the largest automotive IPOs on record. The automaker raised $11.9 billion in its IPO after selling 153 million shares at $78 each.

The offering valued Rivian at nearly $77 billion on a fully diluted basis—just shy of the $80.4 billion market cap held by Ford its primary rival in the US pickup industry.

PitchBook has mapped out a timeline of Rivian’s road to public markets its current ownership breakdown and some key financial measures.



The automaker is the latest high-profile company to go public following in the footsteps of Robinhood and Roblox earlier this year. Rivian will begin trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq under the ticker RIVN.

The company was valued at $27.6 billion earlier this year and has raised more than $11 billion in private capital since it was founded with most of that coming in the last few years according to PitchBook data.



Rivian was founded by RJ Scaringe who remains the company’s CEO. He controls 11.1% of voting power—a far cry from other tech companies that have recently gone public whose founders frequently hold a majority of the voting rights through dual-class share structures.

Amazon is Rivian’s largest investor with a 22.4% stake that is worth $12.5 billion at the IPO price. The online retail giant led a $700 million investment in early 2019 making it one of the earliest large backers.

T. Rowe Price has amassed an 18.8% stake after leading several mega-rounds in recent years. Ford was also a relatively early investor and remains one the company’s largest backers.



Although Rivian was founded in 2009 it took several years for it to raise any significant amount of capital. The company survived off of angel investors and various grants until reportedly receiving a $450 million investment from Sumitomo Corp. Standard Chartered Bank and Abdul Latif Jameel a Saudi Arabian investment group.

From there the company ratcheted up its fundraising pace with Ford Amazon and T. Rowe Price all leading rounds. Since the start of 2019 Rivian has raised nearly $10.5 billion according to PitchBook data.



Rivian’s revenue is minimal as it has only recently started to deliver vehicles and its losses have increased over the years. In the first half of 2021 it lost around $1 billion primarily due to research and development spending.

However the company believes the total addressable market for its products is around $9 trillion and already has more than 55000 non-binding customer preorders for its electric trucks and SUVs in the US and Canada according to company filings. Additionally Amazon has placed a commercial order for 100000 vehicles.

In the long term Rivian hopes to make a substantial amount of recurring revenue from services such as software memberships financing and a charging network.

“If only we could find the dumpster before they light the match.”

That was the joke circulating a few years ago when it emerged that Burberry Group Plc had burned millions of dollars worth of pricey designer goods that it couldn’t sell.

Also read: Are you shopping for a new swimsuit? Try a recycled one

But the practice of destroying unsold luxury products is no laughing matter. Tapestry Inc.’s Coach apologised recently after a story broke on the social media platform TikTok about the US label slashing its handbags and dumping them.

High-end retailers have traditionally sought to destroy goods they couldn’t sell in order to preserve their exclusivity. It was deemed better for unwanted designer handbags shoes and dresses to go up in smoke than to get marked down end up in down-market stores or be worn by the less affluent. Seeing a brand’s logo in any of these scenarios would jeopardise its value so the thinking went.

To put it mildly this view has gotten old. Brand cachet doesn’t just revolve around being exclusive anymore; consumers care more about inclusivity and ethics. Any monetary gain that might come from getting rid of excess supply is now outweighed by shoppers’ outrage at harmful practices. Millennials and Gen Z are most likely to be concerned about whether a brand pollutes or preserves the planet. France is banning the destruction of unsold non-food items next year.

Burberry was criticised by some investors in 2018 after it revealed in its annual report that it had destroyed 28.6 million pounds ($38.9 million) worth of goods. Coach came under fire last month after a video suggested the company slashed bags that customers had returned to stores. Because they were deemed damaged they could no longer be sold or donated the company responded.

It’s hard to put a monetary value on what a brand gains by preventing goods from being sold through unofficial channels and what it loses from a consumer backlash. But there are some clues.

Consumer sentiment towards Burberry and the company’s overall reputation dipped in July 2018 after the stock destruction issue emerged according to YouGov’s BrandIndex. Coach’s brand buzz has also edged lower over the past few weeks.

In September 2018 Burberry said it would end the practice of bag-burning and promised to increase efforts to reuse repair donate or recycle unsold products. It also said it would no longer use real fur. These commitments helped Burberry’s brand value climb in 2019 according to consultancy Interbrand. Of course Burberry also recruited a new designer in 2018 but its environmentally friendly policies likely also made a difference.

That’s because more shoppers particularly younger ones care about going green. According to Tensie Whelan director of New York University’s Center for Sustainable Business having a reputation for being environmentally friendly elevates clothing brands such as Reformation and Patagonia. Shares in green sneaker-maker Allbirds Inc. rose 93% on its first day of trading on Wednesday.

Luckily there are a number of ways that fashion groups can make sure that 1) they don’t have too much leftover stock and 2) they dispose of any excess supply ethically.

Preventing a glut starts with controlling inventory. According to McKinsey & Company 40% of all apparel produced ends up being discounted or disposed of in some way. For example companies including Gucci-owner Kering SA which prohibits the destruction of unsold products are already investing in artificial intelligence to better predict how many dresses or handbags they will be able to sell.

Leftover goods can then go to a brand’s discount stores private sales for employees or donations to charities and fashion schools. Earlier this year Coach started a program for goods it couldn’t sell or donate called Reloved where damaged items could be rehabilitated and sold again. About 40% of stores give their damaged bags to the program but the company says it’s committed to increasing that number and will no longer destroy returned merchandise that can’t be sold or donated.

Luxury groups are also reusing and recycling materials such as the metal hardware on bags at Gucci and old sneakers at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE’s biggest brand Louis Vuitton. A decade ago Hermes International set up Petit H to create new items from ends of lines and leftover materials including leather scraps and silk.

But fashion could go further.

Gucci for example through its Vault online concept store is customising some vintage pieces for resale. Why couldn’t the same approach be taken to unsold stock? Reconditioning items from past seasons in a creative way could turn them from discount to desirable. The rise of luxury resale platforms such as the The RealReal Inc. in the US and Vestiaire Collective in Europe creates an alternative channel to traditional outlet stores.

Perhaps the most striking stance was taken by Italian cashmere-maker Brunello Cucinelli SpA which donated unsold garments from the first half of 2020 estimated to be worth about $35 million to those in need. Yes such projects take effort and resources but top-end groups on both sides of the Atlantic have enjoyed a rebound in sales in the wake of the pandemic. They can afford it.

Amid a growing environmental and social consumer consciousness donating unwanted luxury goods to the less fortunate is more likely to win over shoppers than alienate them.

Shipt customers can place an order online from Target Bed Bath & Beyond CVS GNC and Office Depot in Duluth. A Shipt Shopper will then go to the store browse the aisles like a regular shopper then deliver the order in as soon as an hour. There is also a Shipt Driven service where customers can place an order through a retailer's website and a Shipt Shopper will pick up the order from Best Buy Build-a-Bear and Hollister to deliver.

“We’re just really excited especially given where our community is at as far as comfort level being a little bit different about indoor shopping” said Ashlee Dilley Target's store director.

Dilley said that while Target has offered same-day drive-up and pickup services the delivery option is an exciting new feature for Target and the Duluth community especially as the holiday season approaches.

Like other delivery services Shipt Shoppers communicate with customers over text though a shielded phone number. Shoppers are able to ask about alternatives if a store is out of a product or shoppers can request items they forgot to order. Jaime Keleher Shipt director of regional operations said the customer service and communication with Shift is what the company feels sets itself apart from other shopping and delivery services.

Shipt will deliver to seven ZIP codes in the Duluth area that are within a 20- to 30-minute radius of the stores but Keleher said they are not currently delivering across the bridge to Wisconsin. Alcohol orders cannot be placed but that's another offering Keleher said the company hopes to add soon.

Customers can use the Shipt app or website or order through the store. A Shipt membership is $99 per year and orders can be delivered in any city the service is available. Target.com offered a promotion for 50% off an annual subscription when a customer signed up by Saturday Nov. 6. Customers can also place single orders through Target without a membership and pay a delivery fee for each order. Orders must be at least $35 but there is no limit to the size of an order.

Shipt Shoppers are able to decide when they would like to work and can choose which orders they shop for and deliver. Keleher said many Shipt Shoppers have been drawn to the flexible non-traditional work hours Shipt offers.

“We’re really excited to be in Duluth because it offers an independent contractor the opportunity to essentially choose and work how they want on the schedule they want” Keleher said. “We’ve got about 15 Shoppers hired right now and really we’re just waiting to see how our order volume picks up and ramps.""

The full-scale outline of a U.S. carrier and at least two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are part of the target range that has been built in the Ruoqiang region in central China. The site is near a former target range China used to test early versions of its so-called carrier killer DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles according to press reports in 2013.

This new range shows that China continues to focus on anti-carrier capabilities with an emphasis on U.S. Navy warships. Unlike the Iranian Navy’s aircraft carrier-shaped target in the Persian Gulf the new facility shows signs of a sophisticated instrumented target range.

The carrier target itself appears to be a flat surface without the carrier’s island aircraft lifts weapons sponsons or other details the imagery from Maxar shows. On radar the outline of the carrier stands out from the surrounding desert – not unlike a target picture according to imagery provided to USNI News by Capella Space.

There are two more target areas representing an aircraft carrier that do not have the metaling but are distinguishable as carriers due to their outline. But other warship targets appear to be more elaborate. There are numerous upright poles positioned on them possibly for instrumentation according to the imagery. Alternatively these may be used for radar reflectors to simulate the superstructure of the vessel.

The facility also has an extensive rail system. An Oct. 9 image from Maxar showed a 75 meter-long target with extensive instrumentation on a 6 meter-wide rail.

The area has been traditionally used for ballistic missile testing according to a summary of the Maxar images by geospatial intelligence company AllSource Analysis that identified the site from satellite imagery.

“The mockups of several probable U.S. warships along with other warships (mounted on rails and mobile) could simulate targets related to seeking/target acquisition testing” according to the AllSource Analysis summary which said there are no indications of weapon impact areas in the immediate vicinity of the mockups. “This and the extensive detail of the mockups including the placement of multiple sensors on and around the vessel targets it is probable that this area is intended for multiple uses over time.“

Analysis of historical satellite images shows that the carrier target structure was first built between March and April of 2019. It underwent several rebuilds and was then substantially dismantled in December 2019. The site came back to life in late September of this year and the structure was substantially complete by early October.

China has several anti-ship ballistic missile programs overseen by the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force. The land-based CSS-5 Mod 5 (DF-21D) missile has a range of over 800 nautical miles. It has a maneuverable reentry vehicle (MaRV) to target ships. The larger CSS-18 (DF-26) has a range of around 2000 nautical miles.

“In July 2019 the PLARF conducted its first-ever confirmed live-fire launch into the South China Sea firing six DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles into the waters north of the Spratly Islands” according to the Pentagon’s latest annual report on China’s military. The Chinese are also fielding a longer range anti-ship ballistic missile that initially emerged in 2016.

“The multi-role DF-26 is designed to rapidly swap conventional and nuclear warheads and is capable of conducting precision land-attack and anti-ship strikes in the Western Pacific the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea from mainland China. In 2020 the PRC fired anti-ship ballistic missiles against a moving target in the South China Sea but has not acknowledged doing so” reads the report.

In addition to the land-based anti-ship ballistic missiles China has a program to equip the People’s Liberation Army Navy H-6 bombers with a massive anti-ship ballistic missile. First revealed in 2018 the CH-AS-X-13 will likely be the largest air-launched missile in existence and would be large enough to accommodate a hypersonic warhead.

Another possible launch platform for anti-ship ballistic missiles is the new Type-055 Renhai Class large destroyer. Described as a guided-missile cruiser it will be capable of carrying anti-ship ballistic missiles according to the Pentagon report.

It’s not the first time China has built an aircraft carrier target in the desert. Since 2003 a large concrete pad roughly the size of a carrier has been used as a target. The slab which is part of the Shuangchengzi missile test range has been hit many times and is frequently repaired. The new site in the Taklamakan desert is 600 miles away and is much more evolved. The newer ship targets are closer approximations of the vessels that they are supposed to represent.

While questions remain on the extent of weapons that will be tested at the new facility the level of sophistication of what can now be seen at the site show the PLA is continuing to invest in deterrents to limit the efficacy of U.S. naval forces close to China – in particular targeting the U.S. carrier fleet.

According to the Pentagon report released last week a primary objective of the PLARF will be to keep U.S. carriers at risk from anti-ship ballistic missiles throughout the Western Pacific.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2ZXJ0b25mYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMzQxNTg3L21ldGNhbGZlLW9uLXRhcmdldC1hcy11bmRlci0xOHMtaGVsZC10by1kcmF30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metcalfe On Target As Under-18s Held To Draw,"Everton Under-18s were forced to settle for a point on Saturday as Paul Tait's side drew 1-1 with Blackburn Under-18s.

Across the 90 minutes the young Blues were excellent against a Blackburn side who are top of the Under-18s Premier League.

Over the park there were excellent performances including the midfield three of Luke Butterfield Halid Djankpata and Jenson Metcalfe.

Tait's side started well controlling the game however they were met with an early setback as Junior Ngangou struck a loose ball to give the visitors the lead.

Nevertheless Everton remained confident and took the game to the league leaders and caused various problems.

Into the second half and that momentum only grew as the under-18s got their just reward when Metcalfe fired home an equaliser.

Tait's side began the play from the back and progressed up the park.

Owen Barker played a back heel into the path of Metcalfe who tucked the ball away perfectly into the top corner to level the match.

Chasing a winner the Blues kept attacking the visitors backline and in the final moments there was a penalty shout from the hosts.

However the referee signalled to play on as Everton were denied a goal-scoring opportunity from the penalty spot.

An excellent performance from the young Blues who deserved more than a point but will build upon the positives taken from the draw to Blackburn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzcwMzk4MC9hbC1tYWFkZWVkLWZpcnN0LXFhdGFyaS10by1saXN0LWhpcy1jb21wYW55LW9uLW55c2XSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWxmLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS83MDM5ODAvYWwtbWFhZGVlZC1maXJzdC1xYXRhcmktdG8tbGlzdC1oaXMtY29tcGFueS1vbi1ueXNlL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Al Maadeed first Qatari to list his company on NYSE| Gulf Times,"Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company founded by a Qatari Sultan al-Maadeed has listed its newly acquired Babylon Holdings Limited in the New York Stock Exchange.

Sources close to the matter told Bloomberg that Apple scooped up Christopher “CJ” Moore to work on its self-driving software. He’ll report to Stuart Bowers another Tesla ex-pat who previously served as the vice president of engineering.

During his time at Tesla Moore stirred up controversy for calling CEO Elon Musk’s “full self-driving” claims exaggerated. In January Musk stated that he was “highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.” The full self-driving software currently in beta does not make a Tesla vehicle fully autonomous as a driver must keep control of the vehicle at all times.

Moore pointed out that Tesla is currently at Level 2 referring to the vehicle’s level of autonomy — Level 2 means that the car still requires supervision from the driver while Level 5 signifies full autonomy. Moore has since been called as a witness to the fiery Tesla crash in April that left two people dead.

Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers to decide whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock.

""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance"" Musk said in the tweet.

Musk last month slammed a Democratic proposal to institute a billionaire's tax saying it represented an effort to redistribute wealth from the richest Americans.

Billionaire Elon Musk on Saturday asked his Twitter followers to decide whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock promising to ""abide by the results of this poll whichever way it goes.""

""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock"" the electric car maker's CEO said. He did not directly specify where that 10% would go.

This isn't the first time Musk has taken aim at proposals in Washington that would tax billionaires' net worth gains. Under current US tax law assets like stocks are taxed only when they're sold – what's called a capital gain. But the richest of the rich in America probably aren't selling off their massive stock portfolios; instead their main form of income is the value that those assets accrue or unrealized gains.

Musk last month slammed a Democratic proposal to institute a billionaire's tax floated to help fund a social spending and safety net expansion bill saying it represented the start of a new campaign from the left to redistribute wealth from the richest Americans.

""Eventually they run out of other people's money and then they come for you"" he wrote on Twitter.

In a separate tweet Musk said any government-induced reallocation of wealth would be better managed by the private sector.

""Who is best at capital allocation – government or entrepreneurs – is indeed what it comes down to"" he wrote on Twitter. ""The tricksters will conflate capital allocation with consumption.""

Musk's net worth ballooned this year to $335 billion as Tesla stock has soared. He is by far the wealthiest person on Bloomberg's index tracking the world's richest people.

A White House analysis found that when unrealized gains are counted as income billionaires pay an average of just 8.2% in income taxes.

Meantime a new analysis conducted by the economist Gabriel Zucman for The Washington Post indicated that Musk could face up to $50 billion in taxes in the first five-year stretch if a billionaire's tax should pass.

Thanks to an outstanding two-part presentation and teardown conducted by Ingineerix we can take an in-depth look at this new solution hinted at in early 2021 by Elon Musk and shown only briefly at the delivery event.

The video starts with a general overview of why EVs still use 12 V auxiliary batteries and why they continue to use lead-acid ones while the main traction battery is lithium-ion.

The lead-acid batteries turned out to be problematic in EVs due to a different use case than a starter battery and manufacturers are expected to switch to lithium-ion versions sooner or later (partially with the potential transition to 48 V auxiliary systems). Some individual users were already replacing their 12 V batteries with a li-ion version on their own (like here).

In general a lithium-ion battery should be smaller lighter more reliable and last longer. It could be a bit more expensive but the total cost of ownership should be lower.

The old lead-acid battery vs new lithium-ion

As we can see in the video previously Tesla was using in the Model S/Model X a 12 V 33 Ah lead-acid AGM battery. It stores about 0.4 kWh of energy but weight is quite substantial: 27 lbs (12 kg).

According to Ingineerix such batteries last in Teslas about 2-4 years which is pretty low and sometimes causes unexpected problems if the car stops working.

Tesla 12 V conventional lead acid battery (source: Ingineerix) Tesla 12 V conventional lead acid and lithium battery (source: Ingineerix)

The newlithium-ion battery is much smaller and much lighter (only about 4 lbs / 1.8 kg). That's because it's much higher energy density but also has a lower energy content. We assume that with a more reliable and ""smart"" solution there is no need for 0.4 kWh.

The battery has only a 0.1 kWh of energy (99 Wh to be precise) and a capacity of 6.9 Ah according to the description.

The nominal voltage is slightly higher than normally in lead-acid battery (12.8 V). With four cells in series (3.7 V nominal) it should be at 14.8 V for most of the time.

Tesla Model S Plaid 12 V lithium battery (source: Ingineerix)

As we can see in the second video (on the bottom of this post) the new battery consists of a BMS circuit board made by CATL and four prismatic NMC lithium-ion battery cells (6.9 Ah each) connected in series.

It means that not only are the entry-level Model 3/Model Y equipped with CATL batteries (LFP traction batteries) but also the all-new flagship Model S/Model X has CATL batteries (just the auxiliary not traction ones).

There are no signs of a heating system for the battery which indicates that it's not required. According to the general CATL specs the battery cells can accept charging at temperatures as low as -10°C. And they can discharge at temperatures as lows as -20°C.

There is a theory that the system can heat up the battery with a repeated slow charging/discharging if needed.

The cycle life appears to be high at over 2000 cycles until the capacity will decrease to 80% of the initial value. If everything was well designed it should last as long as the car.

RD cells were purchased from Beina Biotechnology Co. The RD cells were rapidly thawed and resuscitated from liquid nitrogen and cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Hyclone Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) complete medium at 37 °C 5% CO 2 until the cell fusion degree reached 80–90% subculture or the next experiment.

The EV-D68 Fermon strain used in this study was preserved in the Chongqing Medical University laboratory of pathogenic biology and propagated in RD cells. In a nutshell confluent cells were infected with EV-D68 at various multiplicities of infection (MOI) and viruses were collected from supernatants at the indicated infection time points. The tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 /ml) titers for EV-D68 were determined. The day before infection RD cells were seeded in 96-well plates. The virus samples were serially diluted in DMEM with 2% FBS (10−1–10−10) and then each dilution was added to individual wells. For 2–5 days the plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . After 2 to 5 days CPE was observed under a microscope. The REED-Munch endpoint calculation method was used to calculate virus titer which was expressed as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 /ml) [9].

Cell transfection.

Plasmid’s transfection: RD cells were transfected with overexpression constructs using Lipo2000 (Invitrogen carlsbadm CA) at a 1:2 \(\upmu\)g:\(\upmu\)l ratio of plasmid to transfection reagent on the basis of the manufacturer’s protocol. siRNA’s transfection: Using Lipo2000 (Invitrogen carlsbadm CA) with 50 nM siRNA and 2 μl transfection reagents siRNA was transfected into RD cells according to the method of the manufacturer.

RNA extraction

Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA) according to manual instruction. In brief TRIzol was added to the cells and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before being transferred to new centrifuge tubes. A one-fifth volume of chloroform was added and samples were agitated and allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min before being centrifuged at 12000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and the RNA pellets were washed in 1 ml 75% ethanol then centrifuged for 5 min at 12000g at 4 °C. The pellets were then air-dried and resuspended in DEPC-treated H 2 O and stored at − 80 °C until further use. Subsequently total RNA was qualified and quantified using a Nano Drop and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific MA USA); all RNA samples with RIN \(\ge\) 8 and 28 s/18 s \(\ge\) 1 was considered.

High throughput sequencing and construction of RNA library

mRNA LncRNA circRNA library construction and sequencing

DNase I was used to degrade double-stranded and single-stranded DNA in total RNA after which the reaction products were purified using magnetic beads and the rRNA was removed using RNase H or the Ribo-Zero method (human mouse plants) (Illumina USA). The purified mRNA from the previous steps was fragmented into small pieces using fragment buffer at the proper temperature. Then using the First Strand Reaction System first-strand cDNA was created as well as second-strand cDNA. Magnetic beads were used to purify the reaction result and then A-Tailing Mix and RNA Index Adapters were added and incubated to carry out end repair. PCR was used to amplify the cDNA fragments with adapters and Ampure XP Beads were used to purify the results. For quality control the library was validated on an Agilent Technologies 2100 bioanalyzer. The splint oligo sequence heated denatured and circularized the double-stranded PCR products above. The final library was formatted using single strand circular DNA (ssCir DNA). The final library was amplified with phi29 (Thermo Fisher Scientific MA USA) to produce DNA nanoballs (DNBs) with over 300 copies of one molecule. DNBs were inserted into the patterned nanoarray and pair end 100 base readings were generated on the BGISEQ500 platform (BGI-Shenzhen China). In the sequencing process the methods for determining mRNAs lncRNAs and circRNAs are detailed below. For lncRNAs and mRNAs: Clean reads were obtained and stored in FASTQ format after the sequencing data was filtered with SOAPnuke (v1.5.2). HISAT2 was used to map the clean reads to the reference genome (v2.0.4). Then to detect fusion genes and differential splicing genes (DSGs) Ericscript (v0.5.5) and rMATS (V3.2.5) were utilized. Bowtie2 (v2.2.5) was used to align clean reads to the gene set a database created by BGI (Beijing Genomic Institute in ShenZhen) that comprised known and new coding and noncoding transcripts and then RSEM was used to calculate gene expression levels (v1.2.12). For circRNAs: circRNA is predicted by CIRI and Find_circ software. After merging the results of the two softwares quantitative and differential expression analysis of circRNA was performed. (1) CIRI identifies the circRNA according to the reads at the circRNA connection point. (2) Find_circ identifiles circRNA by looking for reverse variable shear joint sequence (back-spliced junction). For a more detailed description of the process see Additional file 1.

Small RNA library construction and sequencing

To make the library start with 1μg total RNA from each sample. First the short RNA fragment of 18-30nt was isolated and retrieved using electrophoresis. Second the 18–30 nt small RNAs were ligated to adenylated 3' adapters annealed to unique molecular identifiers (UMI) before being ligated to 5' adapters. To transcribe and synthesize cDNA use SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen USA). PCR amplification yielded a large number of cDNA fragments. QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Valencia CA) was used to purify cDNA extracted from an agarose gel containing a 110-130bp target fragment. Finally an Agilent 2100 biological analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific MA USA) was used to assess the library's quality. Sequencing is done using the BGISEQ-500 platform (BGI-Shenzhen China). Identification method for miRNAs after we get the raw sequencing data and filter it to get a clean reads Bowtie2 (2 2.2.9) was used to map the clean tags to the reference genome and other sRNA databases such as miRbase siRNA piRNA and snoRNA. Cmsearch (1.1.2) was used for Rfam mapping. Piano was used to predict piRNAs and miRDeep2 ( 2.0.0.8 ) was used to predict novel miRNAs by looking at the secondary structure. For a more detailed description of the process see Additional file 1.

Analysis of differentially expressed genens

In order to evaluate the expression of transcripts according to the length of fragments and the reading counts mapped to these fragments the transcripts per thousand bases and per million mapped reading fragments (FPKM) were calculated by using Cufflinks software (v2.1.1.). In general FPKM≥0.1 indicates that the transcript is expressed. According to the experimental design we used the software of cufflinks to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the EV-D68 infected group and the control group. We set |Log 2 (Fold change) |≥ 1 and Q.value<0.05 as the index to identify the significant difference between infection group and non-infection group.

The construction of the ceRNA regulatory network

Based on the ceRNA theory we constructed a ceRNA regulatory network DEcircRNAs DElncRNAs DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs to demonstrate the regulatory relationship among circRNA lncRNA miRNA and mRNA. We use miRanda (http://www.microrna.org/microrna) to predict the target genes of miRNA. The ceRNA network which consisted of lncRNA-miRNA pairs circRNA-miRNA pairs and miRNA-mRNA pairs with the same miRNA nodes was visualized by Cytoscape 3.8.2.

Functional analysis

In order to further understand the infection mechanism of EV-D68 we conducted GO analysis and KEGG signaling pathway analysis to predict the potential function of DEmRNAs. In the GO analysis we analyze the following three aspects: biological processes (BP) cellular components (CC) and molecular functions (MF). KEGG signaling pathway analysis is to understand the functional classification of differentially expressed genes involved in the pathway or exercise (KEGG as a reference resource for gene and protein annotation http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and carry out statistical analysis with P value < 0.05 as the standard for functional enrichment analysis.

The establishment of the PPI network and identification of hub mRNAs

The String (http://sting-db.org) online database could construct PPI network which was visualized by Cytoscape (v3.8.2). Next using the degree algorithm in the cytohubba plug-in of Cytoscape the degree value could be calculated and thus the hub genes could also be screened from PPI network.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)

The Mir-X miRNA First-Strand synthesis kit (TaKaRa China) was used on total RNA for reverse transcription of miRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa China) was used on total RNA for reverse transcription of mRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRQ 3′ Primer supplied with the kit is the 3′primer for miRNA RT-qPCR. The Oligo 7 software was used to design specific primers according to the sequence of the selected genes and the specificity of the primers was evaluated by NCBI Primer-BLAST and dissolution curve. The qualified primers were produced by Tsingke Biotechnology Company (Beijing). The miRNAs expression level was normalized to U6 and the expression level of mRNAs were normalized to \(\beta\)-actin. The data analysis was carried out by using 2−ΔΔCt method. The primers for RT-qPCR were shown in Table 1.

Western blot assay

The total protein extraction kit is used to extract total protein from the treated cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA). Protein BCA Assay Kit was used to determine the protein concentration in the lysate (Beyotime Shanghai China). The protein was separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a PVDF membrane for western blot detection. Block the membrane for 1 hour with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffer saltwater containing Tween 20 at room temperature. They were then incubated with primary antibodies against EV-D68 VP1 (1:5000 GeneTex Shanghai China) Fos (1:5000 Proteintech Group Wuhan China) ARRDC3 (1:5000 Proteintech Group Wuhan China) β-actin (1:8000 Proteintech Group Wuhan China) and GAPDH (1:8000 Proteintech Group Wuhan China) overnight at 4°C before being incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with secondary antibodies bound to horseradish peroxidase. The target protein is seen and quantified with Bio-hypersensitive Rad's ECL chemiluminescence kit (New Cell & Molecular Biotech Co. Ltd. Suzhou China).

Plasmid construction and siRNA synthesis

To construct the overexpression plasmids for Fos and ARRDC3 we used Table 2 primers to amplify the coding regions of Fos and ARRDC3 from the genomes of RD cells (synthesized by Tsingke Biotechnology Beijing Co. Ltd.). PCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP-T2A-Puro (CD513B) was digested with ECORI and XhoI and the PCR fragment was cloned into the necessary location to generate Fos and ARRDC3 overexpression plasmids (Additional file 2). Tsingke Biotechnology Beijing Co. Ltd. produced siRNA (Table 3).

Human cervical cancer specimens (N = 24) were taken from cervical cancer patients during surgery at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. The non-tumour tissues near the cancers were collected simultaneously from the same patients. Patients did not receive preoperative treatments. All patients consented to the study. The study was reviewed and received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. All specimens were placed in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection and then stored in a freezer (−80 °C).

Cell culture and treatment

Human cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa and CaSki) were used and purchased from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank (Shanghai China). The medium used for cell culture was composed of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco CA USA) plus 10% foetal bovine serum (Thermo-Fisher Scientific MA USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco USA). The cells were maintained in a CO 2 incubator at 37 °C.

For drug treatments cultured cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and then treated with various concentrations of the ferroptosis inducer sorafenib (0 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 μM) autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (10 mM) ferrostatin-1 (Fer1 1 μM) or iron-chelating agent (deferoxamine mesylate DFO 100 μM) for 48 h as indicated in the figures before harvest for further analysis.

Plasmids and cell transfection

The full-length sequences of Cdc25A p-PKM2 ser37 and PKM2S37D phosphorylation-mimic mutants were cloned into the overexpression construct (pcDNA3.1). Sh-ErbB2 and control sh-NC were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai China). Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen China) was utilized as the reagent for cell transfection. Briefly cells were cultured to 70–80% confluence and then added to the plasmid together with Lipofectamine 3000 at a ratio of 1:1.

Subcellular fractionation

Cell nucleus and cytosolic fractions were isolated as previously described [21]. Briefly cells were homogenized with sucrose buffer (320 mM sucrose) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the nuclear pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to yield the membrane fraction (pellet) and a cytosolic fraction (supernatant). Cytosolic fraction (supernatant) was saved for further analysis. Lysis buffer was added to resuspend the nucleus followed by sonication for protein extraction and further analysis.

3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay

Cell viability was measured with a MTT assay (Sigma). Cultured transfected cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (Corning Life Sciences USA) and treated with drugs at the indicated concentrations. MTT (5 mg/mL) was added at 24 48 72 and 96 h post-treatment and incubated with cells for 4 h. Afterwards the supernatant was removed and 150 µL dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the plate. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a plate reader (Glomax; Promega MI USA).

Lipid peroxidation assay (malondialdehyde (MDA))

Cellular MDA levels were determined by the lipid peroxidation assay kit (Abcam ab118970 UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cultured or transfected cells following drug treatments were harvested in MDA lysis solution. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) solution was mixed with standards or test samples and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 95 °C followed by ice-cooling for 10 min. The absorbance of the TBA–MDA adduct at 532 nm was measured with a plate reader (GloMax; Promega MI USA).

Cellular ROS detection assay

ROS levels were determined with a standard ROS detection kit (Abcam ab113851 UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cultured or transfected cells following drug treatments were switched to fresh media and then added to ROS/Superoxide Detection Mix for incubation in the cell incubator for 1 h. The media was discarded and the cells were washed with 1 × washing buffer. A coverslip was used to overlay the cells. The fluorescence intensity (Ex/Em = 490/525 nm) was analysed using confocal microscopy.

Cellular glutathione (GSH) detection assay

Intracellular GSH levels were measured with a standard GSH detection assay kit (Abcam ab112132 UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cultured or transfected cells following drug treatments were incubated with Thiol Green Dye for 30 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the cells. The cells were resuspended in a culture medium and the fluorescence intensity was analysed with flow cytometry.

Cellular iron detection assay

Intracellular iron levels (Fe2+) were determined with a standard iron assay kit (Abcam ab83366 UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cultured or transfected cells following drug treatments were washed with cold PBS and then lysed in iron assay buffer followed by centrifugation at 16000 × g for 10 min to collect the supernatants. An iron reducer was added to both the samples and standards and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterwards an iron probe was added and incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C in the dark. Output (OD 593 nm) was measured on the microplate reader.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR

TRIzol (Invitrogen China) was used to extract total RNA from cervical cancer cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNaseI was included in the lysis buffer to avoid DNA contamination. A commercial kit (cDNA synthesis kits Thermo-Fisher China) was utilized to generate cDNAs through reverse transcription. SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen China) was used for quantitative PCR. Relative mRNA expression levels of Cdc25A and ErbB2 were normalized to GAPDH mRNA as an internal control. The relative expression was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primers listed as follows were from GenePharma (Shanghai China):

Cdc25A forward primer: 5′-TGTGCCGGTATGTGAGAGAG-3′;

Cdc25A reverse primer: 5′-TGCGGAACTTCTTCAGGTCT-3′;

GAPDH forward primer: 5′-CCAGGTGGTCTCCTCTGA-3′;

GAPDH reverse primer: 5′-GCTGTAGCCAAATCGTTGT-3′.

Western blot analysis

Proteins from cervical cancer cells or tumours were extracted by utilizing RIPA lysis buffer (Abcam China) according to a standard protocol. A DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad China) was utilized to quantify the protein concentrations. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were loaded into SDS-polyacrylamide gels and separated through electrophoresis. Later proteins in the gels were transferred to PVDF membranes (Sigma-Aldrich China). BSA (3%) was used to block the membranes for 30–60 min at room temperature specific primary antibodies were added and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The antibodies were discarded and TBST was utilized to wash the membranes three times before incubation with specific secondary antibodies for 1–2 h at room temperature. Protein band intensities were detected by using a standard ECL kit. The primary antibodies used in the study were as follows: anti-p62 antibody (1: 1000 Cell Signalling Technology #5114T USA); anti-LC3-I antibody (1: 1000 Millipore ABC929 USA); anti-LC3-II antibody (1: 1000 Millipore ABC929 USA); anti-ErbB2 (1: 1000 Cell Signalling Technology #2242S USA); anti-p-PKM2 Ser37 (1: 1000 ThermoFisher #PA5-37684 USA); anti-PKM2 (1: 1000 Cell Signalling Technology #3198S USA); anti-Cdc25A (1: 1000 ThermoFisher #PA5-77092 USA); anti-p-H3T11 (1: 1000 Abcam ab5168 UK); anti-H3K9Ac (1: 1000 Cell Signalling Technology #9671 USA); anti-FTH1 (1: 1000 Abcam ab65080 UK); anti-TfR1 (1: 1000 Abcam ab84036 UK); and anti-Tubulin (1:2000 Abcam ab6046 UK).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

ChIP was performed using a commercial ChIP kit (Cell Signalling Technology USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For each ChIP 5 μg of anti-H3K9Ac and 1 μL of normal rabbit IgG were used. IgG antibody was included as a negative control. After immunoprecipitation chromosomal DNA was purified. The ErbB2 promoter region was detected by using PCR.

Immunofluorescence

Autophagy was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Briefly cells were transfected with the GFP-LC3 construct before drug treatment using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At the end of the indicated experiments cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10–12 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS followed by confocal imaging.

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)

Cervical cancer cells were transfected with Cdc25A and flag-PKM2 for 48 h. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated as described above and then lysed with lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor. Protein concentrations were quantified with a Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA). Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with Anti-Flag antibody (Thermo Fisher USA) for 1 h at 4 °C and then with Protein-A Sepharose beads (Abcam UK) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed in lysis buffer followed by elution with SDS loading buffer. The elution proceeded with standard western blotting.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

The cervical tissues were fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C overnight washed with PBS and then embedded in paraffin. The tumour tissues were sliced into 10-μm-thick sections and dried overnight at 37 °C on glass slides. The dried slices were deparaffinized in xylene first followed by rehydration through a graded concentration of alcohol. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) was used to quench the sections and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to block the slices for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody (anti-Cdc25A; 1:500; ThermoFisher #PA5-77092 USA) was added and incubated with the slices at 4 °C overnight. The next day the antibody was washed off with PBS and secondary antibodies were added and incubated with sections for 2 h at room temperature. Substrates of the Envision system-HRP from the kit (Dako REAL Ebision kit; DAKO Glostrup Denmark) were added to incubate with stained slices as the manufacturer’s protocol described and the signals were analysed with a light microscope.

Dual-luciferase assay

Fragments of the cDNAs containing the promoter region of ErbB2 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the Sall and BamHl restriction sites of the pGLO luciferase reporter vector (Promega WI USA). Cervical cancer cells were seeded in individual wells of 24-well plates first overnight and then recombinant constructs were transfected into cancer cells by using Lipofectamine 3000. The co-transfected cells were treated with sorafenib for 48 and then harvested to measure relative luciferase activities by the Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Dual-GloTM Luciferase Assay System Promega Madison WI USA).

Nude mouse xenograft model

All animal experiments were reviewed and received approval by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. Four-week-old male nude mice (N = 72) were purchased from SJA Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. (Hunan China) and raised in the standard animal facility room. Cervical cancer cells were infected with the control vector Cdc25A Cdc25A + sh-NC and Cdc25A + sh-ErbB2 lentiviruses for 24 h and then unilateral subaxillary subcutaneously injected into nude mice (1 × 107 cells per mouse) to induce tumours. Non-infected cervical cancer cells were used for the saline group and sorafenib group. For sorafenib treatment the mice received intraperitoneal injection of sorafenib (10 mg/kg) every 2 days starting at day 8. Saline was used as a control and the mice in the saline group were intraperitoneally injected with saline every 2 days starting at day 8. Tumours were monitored on a daily basis for 30 days. Tumour length (L) and width (W) were analysed to quantify the tumour volume (V): V (mm3) = 0.5 × (W)2 × (L). Finally tumours were dissected to measure weight and the tumour tissues were harvested for further analysis.

Quantifications and statistical analysis

All experimental data were analysed in GraphPad Prism 7. Statistical analyses included unpaired Student’s t-test (for two groups) and one-way ANOVA (for more than two groups) and are indicated in the figure legends. The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyZWVyc3BvcnRhbC5pZS9uZXdzL2NhbnNhdC1pcmVsYW5kLS0tc3RlbS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1mb3Itc2VuaW9yLWN5Y2xlLXN0dWRlbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CanSat Ireland - STEM Competition for Senior Cycle Students | Physics Mathematics & Space Science Sector News ...,,,,

Techstars Seattle is proud to announce the 13th cohort of early-stage startups to participate in the venture accelerator’s 12-year heritage of entrepreneurial success.

Our new class of startups follow in the footsteps of an incredible portfolio of companies who have participated in the Techstars Seattle accelerator in years past. Alumni include notable unicorns such as Remitly Outreach and Zipline. Collectively Techstars Seattle portfolio companies have raised well in excess of $1.5 billion of growth capital following the completion of the program. And our teams’ successes run not only deep but wide: over 75% of our alumni companies have exited or are still running today.

This year we have strengthened our support for entrepreneurs by increasing our class size from 10 to 12 early-stage companies. Techstars Seattle remains committed to seeking diverse founders and notably after achieving 50% CEO gender diversity in the Spring 2021 cohort we are continuing the trend this fall with 6 women CEOs out of 12. Overall 83% of our CEOs identify as part of an underrepresented community in the tech ecosystem.

The Fall 2021 Cohort represents a wide range of tech sectors including B2B SaaS e-commerce travel HR tech consumer services cleantech edtech wellness and meal delivery.

The past two Techstars Seattle cohorts have thrived despite launching into the teeth of the pandemic. As the world emerges from its prolonged sequestration there’s never been a better time to start a company. So we’re thrilled to welcome these 12 promising teams to participate in our rich heritage of technology startup success and to share their hope for a better future.

Safety can mean different things to different people from the likelihood of civil unrest or terrorism to the level of COVID-19 infections or whether you can drink the tap water or wear flashy jewelry in public. Depending on where you get your news and advice from a destination could appear to be very safe or very unsafe before you've even arrived.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our free daily newsletter.

For example I visited Kuwait before the pandemic and didn't know much about the destination before I arrived. I personally found it to be one of the safest places I'd ever visited. On the other hand when I visited Turkey I happened to have my phone stolen in a restaurant. So while it's generally a very safe destination to visit my personal memory of safety in Istanbul was clouded by this single incident.

Rather than just basing your decision on one other person's experience or water cooler gossip how do you determine the safety for yourself?

For starters I'd avoid throwing out a broad question on social media. Someone who may not have even visited the place might convince you that you shouldn't visit because they saw something online that may have been #fakenews.

The best place to start is the U.S. Department of State's Travel Advisories. The website displays information and advises on safety and gives each country a safety warning rating from one to four:

Level 1: Exercise normal precautions

Level 2: Exercise increased caution

Level 3: Reconsider travel

Level 4: Do not travel

Before the pandemic most countries were classified as Level 1 or 2 which meant they were reasonably safe to visit (provided you took normal precautions). COVID-19 turned the travel world upside down and led the agency to add most of the world's countries to its highest advisory last April. The State Department has lowered levels for some destinations however. For example travel to the United Kingdom and Israel was reduced in May from Level 4 to Level 3. As of late July at least 87 countries remained under Level 4 advisories.

This State Department site does tend to err on the side of caution even pre-pandemic. For example it warns there is a risk of terrorism in Iceland though you certainly may not feel like it when you are there (I sure didn't). Don't let this website scare you from visiting somewhere it deems Level 1 safe even if it does list lots of caveats to that safety.

However the Level 4 advisory for so many countries is very clear-cut – you should not travel to these destinations until the advice changes even if you are permitted entry or vaccinated against COVID-19. You should also carefully read the terms and conditions of your travel insurance policy as traveling to a Level 3 or 4 destination may invalidate your insurance policy. This could be disastrous if something goes wrong during your travels.

Note that conditions can change rapidly in a country at any time. To receive updated Travel Advisories and Alerts from the State Department choose the method that works best for you at travel.state.gov/stayingconnected.

Normal precautions for traveling right now even if you are fully vaccinated would include:

Check entry requirements to determine if you are required to present or take any COVID-19 tests. Pay close attention to the types of tests required;

Practice social distancing;

Wear a mask where required by local rules or guidelines especially in places like public transportation and supermarkets;

Wash and sanitize your hands regularly — it's a good idea to carry hand sanitizer with you if you're not sure how easy it will be to find hand-washing facilities at your destination.

Even if you're fully vaccinated remember that many foreign countries have only vaccinated small numbers of their populations. So you likely won't experience relaxed restrictions like you may be starting to enjoy at home right now.

Related: UPDATED: When will international travel return? A country-by-country guide to coronavirus recovery

If you are still undecided about a destination for example what the exact risk of terrorism in Iceland currently is another valuable resource for considering safety is the Foreign Travel Advice section of the U.K. Government website. There are detailed guides to safety with insights for 225 different countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Along with essential information about COVID-19 restrictions there are handy tips and cultural knowledge you might not find in a glossy holiday brochure.

For example while Singapore is considered an extremely safe destination you might not know that public drunkenness is frowned upon and may result in a much harsher penalty than elsewhere. Meanwhile Jordan is a relatively safe country to visit but the website warns to go nowhere near the border with neighboring Syria. There are all sorts of travel tips here and it's updated regularly with things like entry requirements local currency and embassy contact information.

Suppose there's certain information you are looking for about a destination beyond general safety for mass tourism and government travel websites don't have information this specific. In that case you may wish to consult a resource like TripAdvisor or Lonely Planet (which is owned by Red Ventures TPG's parent company) to see if this question has been asked on a forum before.

I often find that my exact question has been asked and numerous experienced travelers in that destination have answered. If it's just one random answer I might keep looking but if 10 different people are all giving the same advice I would feel comfortable following it especially if it was recent.

Just keep in mind that if someone advises ""XYZ country is very safe"" or ""XYZ country is not safe and you shouldn't visit"" this is likely just their personal opinion or experience and you should start with the government advice linked above.

Bottom line

All travel comes with some level of risk and these government resources are not a guarantee that your experience will be exactly as they promise. Still they do err on the side of caution which should be comforting for inexperienced travelers.

Unfortunately much of the world is considered off-limits due to the pandemic which will hopefully change as vaccination programs continue and COVID-19 cases fall.

Tourist attractions merchants and restaurants that had been shuttered for a good part of the year are now cracking open their doors again cautiously optimistic for a revival in a sector that in 2019 brought in more than 1.91 trillion baht (S$77.6 billion).

The nation's reopening on Nov 1 and Bangkok's hot weather lured sports teacher Christian Schubert 40 to escape the chill of Germany's autumn.

""The world has waited long enough for Covid-19 to be under control and I feel like it's finally time to travel"" said Mr Schubert who was wandering in the complex of Bangkok's Grand Palace barely 24 hours after touching down on Wednesday (Nov 3).

""It's a good time to come before the crowd of mass tourism returns.""

Already about 16000 foreign arrivals have entered Thailand through the various travel schemes that were expanded since Nov 1 with most coming from the United States Germany Britain and Japan said the authorities.

Fully vaccinated air travellers from approved countries and territories can enter the kingdom without undergoing quarantine.

Instead they will take a Covid-19 test upon landing and spend a night at a government-approved hotel where they have to wait for a negative result before they can travel freely in Thailand.

Those coming from places not on the quarantine-free list can enter via one of the 17 ""sandbox"" provinces where they can roam quarantine-free but must remain in the province for a week before travelling elsewhere.

But genuine holidaymakers such as Mr Schubert will remain a rare breed for the time being those in the tourism sector told The Sunday Times.

""It's still early. Most people who will enter Thailand right now are either Thai people returning residents or those travelling for practical reasons like business trips"" said Thai Hotels Association (THA) president Marisa Sukosol Nunbhakdi.

Freelance tour guide Taweesak Sattayankarn 70 who returned to ply his services outside the Grand Palace and the nearby Wat Phra Kaeo temple on Monday (Nov 1) said most of the visitors to the area are domestic tourists.

""I haven't really seen any foreign tourists yet"" said Mr Taweesak noting that the palace used to see some 20000 visitors daily but now sees about 100 or so.",,,

TRIMBLE Ohio (WOUB) — The Trimble Tomcats came into Saturday night’s battle with the East Knox Bulldogs as the five seed in Division VII Region 27. They finished the regular season 7-2 overall 4-0 in TVC conference play and were coming off a 38-0 victory over Fisher Catholic in the first round of the OHSAA Playoffs. East Knox came into the game as the four seed and had home field advantage. They finished 8-2 in the regular season 5-1 in conference play and defeated Reedsville Eastern 41-13 in the first round of the playoffs. East Knox also came into the game undefeated at home. The stage was set for a great round two matchup and we got just that.

Bryce Downs got the scoring started for the Tomcats as he ran in a 67-yard touchdown run to give Trimble the 7-0 lead. Get used to hearing Downs’ name.

After a Trimble interception by Austin Wisor the Tomcats drove down the field and Downs again capped off the drive with a 26-yard touchdown run to give the Tomcats a 14-0 lead going into the second quarter.

In the second quarter is when the Bulldog offense and quarterback Peyton Lester woke up. Lester started the scoring for East Knox with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Blake Bonham to cut the Tomcats lead in half.

Downs was not done yet though. On the next Trimble drive Downs ran in a 64-yard score that would put the Tomcats up by 14 again 21-7.

Lester then came back a little over a minute later and found Shane Knepp who would have a toe-tap grab in the back of the endzone from 25-yards out to make it 21-14. Knepp is another name to get used to hearing.

Then who other than Downs with yet another touchdown. This time from 58-yards out to keep the Tomcats ahead. Downs accounted for 215-yards on just touchdowns in the first half. Dominant.

Before the end of the half Lester again found Knepp for a 29-yard score to get the Bulldogs within a touchdown going into halftime. 28-21.

The second half is when both defenses tightened up the screws.

There was only one score in the third quarter and it was Lester again finding Knepp for his third score of the game. This time for 26-yards but after a blocked point after attempt the Tomcats still led 28-27.

That lead would hold for the rest of the third quarter and majority of the fourth quarter. Both teams traded punts and failed fourth downs for the first 11 minutes of the final quarter until the Bulldogs broke through.

On third down Lester dropped back and threw down the right sideline to his most trusted receiver. Despite the ball being a bit underthrown and having two Tomcat defenders also clambering for the ball Knepp rose up caught the pass and dove into the endzone to give the Bulldogs their first lead of the game with just 38 precious seconds left.

Knepp then stood up in the back right corner of the endzone and raised both of his arms in the air. As he looked back to his teammates on the field his teammates off the field and the community that backed him the whole way he seemingly soaked in the moment.

However the Tomcats had one last chance. With four seconds left Trimble quarterback Tabor Lackey rolled to his right and threw a prayer down the field that was never answered. The ball was batted down.

Tomcat players were scattered around the field heartbroken and in disbelief that their season was over. Bulldog players ran and jumped around the field elated to get to play for at least one more week.

After the game East Knox head coach Cody Reese who is also the principal at the school talked about Shane Knepp. “Really successful first half coming out in the second half we saw some things that we liked so we continued to try to get the ball to him. He continued to make those plays. You love it when you have a senior who’s selfless and a team player like that stepping up making those plays because he’s all about the team.” Knepp was the catalyst for the Bulldog offense but not to be overshadowed is his quarterback Peyton Lester. Lester threw for 395 yards on 24 completions a 63.2% completion percentage and five touchdown passes.

Knepp finished the game with nine catches for 183 yards and his four touchdowns.

Downs finished the game for the Tomcats with 23 rushes for 277 yards good for 12 yards per carry and four touchdowns.

Lackey also added on 15 rushes for 78 yards.

For Trimble this is the end of the road for seniors like Tabor Lackey Bryce Downs and Blake Guffey just to name a few. It was a big senior class that accounted for a lot of yards tackles and touchdowns. Production that will have to be filled next year with the younger players. For East Knox they move onto week 13 and a date with the number one seed in the region the Newark Catholic GreenWave. That will be at a neutral site and at a date and time to be named later.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Electric Supply Company Field at Truist Stadium Whitehead Ave NE Wilson NC 27893









Year Opened: 2019

Capacity: 3500

Electric Blue at Barton





After a 70-year hiatus the Barton Bulldogs finally fielded a football team again starting in the spring of 2021 although without many fans in attendance – like many schools the planned 2020 season was put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Starting in the fall of 2021 however the Barton Bulldogs are finally able to fill their brand-new facility Electric Supply Company Field at Truist Stadium – the venue was mostly completed in 2019 but the new press box tower was added in 2021. The facility holds 3500 fans with grandstands along both sidelines and features a bright blue border around the playing surface.





Food & Beverage 5

When it comes to concessions Truist Stadium shines with several different food trucks and an assortment of menu items which rivals that of much larger stadiums although strangely the concessions are not near the main stands but instead are located in one end zone and on the visitor’s side since that is where the venue has space for them.





Starting off the list is Item 9 Pizza which sells its 10” cheese or pepperoni pizzas from a white food truck for $11 or $12 followed by Sunset Slush (black food truck) which offers ice cream gelato or Italian ice starting at $4. You can also get wings or burgers from the Chiefs on the River food truck (also white) starting at $5 or $6 for the main dish only or $12 for a combo meal with fries and a drink – I didn’t try the wings but heard they were to die for. There is also a fixed concessions stand that sells typical items such as popcorn peanuts candy and chips and all the stands sell bottled water bottled soda or energy drinks if you need a beverage.





My personal favorite at Truist Stadium however is Krueger’s Candies (blue food truck) which sells Brightleaf hot dogs with chili for only $3 and Krueger’s even makes their hot dog buns! The buns have a very slightly sweet flavor and the hot dogs are the rare red type which incidentally is very popular in North Carolina (you can buy them at some of the MiLB stadiums in NC for example at Carolina Mudcats games). Besides hot dogs Krueger’s also sells nachos and caramels but the hot dogs are the best – you can’t beat the $3 price anywhere for a chili dog and they taste amazing to boot.





Atmosphere 4

Truist Stadium is a great venue and it still retains that new modern look and feel – think new car smell. The bright blue border around the field pops and the team has all the typical bells and whistles such as the cheerleaders running back and forth waving flags after each score and a bulldog mascot in costume. The only downside I would mention is that the scoreboard doesn’t have any video capability for replays.





Neighborhood 5

Truist Stadium is located in Wilson NC which is not that big of a town but there are plenty of restaurants and hotels nearby if you plan to be in town for the day or the weekend. The variety of restaurants near the venue is pretty impressive ranging from Kountry Kitchen and Western Sizzlin to barbecue Mexican and fast food to Daniel’s Casual Fine Dining and Varee Asian Café & Bakery. The hotels tend to be a little further from the stadium closer to I-795 but you can choose from a variety of options ranging from America’s Best Value Inn on the cheaper side to Holiday Inn and Hampton Inn on the more expensive side.





Where Wilson shines however is in terms of the attractions it offers – probably the most interesting and unique is Whirligig Park & Museum featuring wind-powered mechanical sculptures which look kind of like Rube Goldberg machines (think the Mousetrap game you may have played as a kid where you put together different pieces to make a complicated machine to trap the mouse). Whirligig Park is worth a look and if you are a sports fan Wilson also offers the NC baseball museum in addition to numerous historical sites parks and botanical gardens.





Fans 2

The crowd at Truist Stadium is very small unfortunately and it may take some time for Barton to build up its fan base again after such a long football hiatus. This is a shame since the venue is so nice – you definitely would not expect to see such a small crowd here.





Access 4

Truist Stadium and Barton College are very easy to get to; not far from I-95 and I-795 inside the loop made up of Highway 42 and Highway 301. If you don’t have a special pass (which will let you park right next to the field) you can park for free 2-3 blocks from the stadium in a small parking lot on Woodard Street. There is not very good signage however about where to park so just ask for directions at one of the VIP lots you pass and the parking attendants there will be happy to point you in the right direction.





Once you get to the stadium there are plenty of entrances behind the north end zone – all tickets are technically mobile tickets but if you didn’t buy one beforehand or don’t have a Smartphone with you you can still buy a ticket (basically a QR code printed out on plain paper not a regular ticket) at the door. The concourse is easy to move around and there are more than enough restrooms to accommodate the crowd. One thing to mention is that the bathrooms are inside large trailers but they are modern and better than you might expect – note that the differently-abled bathrooms offer a lot more room inside and have elongated seats so those might be a better option for some fans.





Return on Investment 5

General admission tickets to football games at Truist Stadium are $17 including fees which is very reasonable for this level of football; couple that with free parking an outstanding and brand-new facility and cheap concessions depending on which items you choose and Barton Bulldogs football offers a great return on investment for your sports viewing dollar.

Following Tuesday’s World Series victory in six games over the defending champion Houston Astros the team paraded through the city and into The Battery where Truist Park the Braves’ home stadium is located.

After 26 years without a World Series title Braves fans were desperate for another celebration. With mounting anticipation in the days leading to the parade s districts in Dekalb Cobb and Fulton counties cancelled class on Friday so students could watch their team parade through the city. Many Atlanta businesses closed for the day as well.

The hype met expectations for those at The Battery but was a let down for some who felt the parade through the heart of the city was too fast.

For many partying started before the sun rose. Fans packed the plaza and bars at The Battery and by 10 a.m. the lines for the team store and entry to the park were wrapped around the block. Streets downtown were closed off early in the morning so fans could line the parade route.

The parade started in Midtown at noon and traveled north up Peachtree Street. Players were either on top of double-decker buses or sitting on the back of pickup trucks so fans could see them. Fan-favorite outfielder Joc Pederson tossed out pearl necklaces to fans as the beads became a good luck charm for the team and part of his identity. Fans threw beers at the players for them to chug nearly knocking the Commissioner’s Trophy out of the players’ hands.

For some players being in the vehicle was too far away from being with the fans. Relief pitcher Tyler Matzek got off the bus and high-fived fans along the street. At one point Atlanta police tried to arrest him because they thought he wasn’t a player. After some confusion Matzek was able to continue partying with the fans.

The downtown parade flew through the streets before the buses headed up into Cobb County for the second leg of the parade. The buses at times were going nearly 25 mph through the streets giving fans only a glimpse of the team. In 2017 the Braves moved from Turner Field in downtown Atlanta to Truist Park up in Cobb County. The fast driving buses were met with anger by some fans who felt the team was not taking its time to pay homage to the city of Atlanta.

After the buses exited I-75 by The Battery the parade continued on Cobb Parkway. Fans greeted the players as they eventually reached the ballpark where a ceremony and concert took place alongside their World Series trophy.

Each player and coach was individually introduced as they walked from center field towards the makeshift stage constructed at second base. Pitcher Charlie Morton who fractured his fibula in Game 1 of the series was greeted with rounds of applause as he crutched his way up to the stage.

Speakers at the celebration included team executives and players who thanked the fans for their support. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also took the stage although she was met with boo’s from the crowd who criticized her support for the MLB’s decision to move the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta following a restrictive state voting law that passed earlier this year.

Hank Aaron’s widow Billye Aaron also took the stage to honor the team where she was met with a standing ovation from the crowd. Braves legend Hank Aaron passed away this past January at the age of 87. With Aaron’s No. 44 etched into the outfield grass all season long the Braves were thinking about his legacy all season long. Prior to the All-Star break the Braves won 44 games and after the All-Star break also won exactly 44 games. Their World Series victory also happened to be on the 44th week of the year.

“The spirit of Hank Aaron pervades the space” Billye Aaron said. “He is here with us. He loved the Atlanta Braves and I am so very very happy to see these young men who have picked up the mantle and who have carried it on.”

Following manager Brian Snitker’s remarks the first Braves player to speak to the fans was first baseman and the longest-tenured player on the team Freddie Freeman. Freeman won his first World Series after 15 years with the team and thanked the fans for supporting the ball club during the roughest points of the season.

“It’s not [the players]… We did it because [the fans] are the reason we’re standing on this stage” Freeman said.

Freeman’s contract expired after the season ended meaning there’s a chance he’s no longer an Atlanta Brave. Fans chanted “resign Freddie” all afternoon and while they are not supposed to talk about other players’ contracts some of his teammates joined in as well.

“It might get me in trouble but resign Freddie” shortstop Dansby Swanson said right before he dropped the microphone on stage.

Starting pitcher Max Fried catcher Travis d’Arnaud and second baseman Ozzie Albies each emphasized Swanson’s message to resign arguably the team’s most valuable player.

The most memorable quote of the day came from Pederson who held a lit cigar in his hands at all times.

“Guess what? We are those motherf—–s” Pederson said.

Before exiting the stage red white and blue confetti was shot up into the air which spurred the players to dance and celebrate. Many including Freeman hoisted the trophy one more time as the confetti fell from the sky.

Following the players’ ceremony the party continued for close to an hour as Atlanta rappers Ludacris and Big Boi performed for the sold out crowd of 40000. Zac Brown and Killer Mike also made surprise appearances before Queen’s infamous song “We Are The Champions

played through the stadium’s speakers.

The Braves finally broke the curse and were able to party again like it was 1995 the last time they won the World Series.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIvYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMvZm9vdGFnZS1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtYWNjaWRlbnRhbGx5LWhpdHRpbmctY2hpbGQtaGVhZC1iYXNlYmFsbC13b3JsZC1zZXJpZXMvODUtYjczYTc2MWUtZTA5MC00ZDRkLThjYmMtNTA3NzMxOGY1Y2Qz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donald Trump accidentally hits child with signed baseball,"Donald Trump made an appearance at Game 4 of the 2021 World Series.

ATLANTA — Donald Trump made an appearance at the 2021 World Series. Now footage of the former president accidentally hitting a child with a baseball on the head during his visit is making its way around the internet.

The Atlanta Braves faced off against the Houston Astros in their home Atlanta stadium Truist Park for Game 4 of the 2021 World Series. Former President Donald Trump's expected appearance made headlines ahead of the game. But one fan managed to walk away with something unexpected — a signed baseball from the 45th President of the United States.

Just below the former president's open-air suite within Truist Park one young baseball fan tried to get Trump's attention. In footage posted to TikTok the fan can be seen gesturing for the former president to sign his baseball.

Trump obliged with the child tossing his ball into the suite. Trump signed the ball before tossing it back. But the billionaire industrialist's aim was a little off. The signed baseball softly hit the fan on the head; no injuries were visibly endured during the video.

Footage of the World Series moment from the former president can be viewed below.

Tens of thousands of fans lined up in downtown Atlanta and along Cobb Parkway as the Braves’ caravan made its way to the ballpark.

For a moment the exuberance almost got the best of Cobb County’s finest as police surrounded a man whom they thought had wandered out from the crowd but who was actually Braves’ relief pitcher Tyler Matzek.

It was hard not to get caught up in cheering on a team that was devastated by injuries didn’t have a winning record until late in the season then knocked off teams predicted to beat them including last year’s champions the Los Angeles Dodgers in the playoffs.

As someone who grew up in metro Atlanta and whose family’s ties to the Braves go back to their days in Milwaukee this last week truly has been special for me.

My first game as a fan was as an eight-year-old in 1969 when the Braves won their first pennant in town.

In 1995 when the Braves won the World Series at the same venue I was a sportswriter at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. I don’t remember much about that decisive Game 6 on a Saturday night at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium as I was coming back from somewhere after covering a college football game.

So it was a real treat to savor the first sports team I had ever followed beat back all the obstacles. This year’s Braves are a testament to determination resilience teamwork and optimism qualities that take on special significance during these abnormal times of a pandemic.

The euphoria was bound to go overboard of course as these occasions sometimes do.

On Thursday in a commentary published in our local daily newspaper the headline referred to the late Tim Lee the former county commission chairman who brokered the stadium deal that brought the Braves to Cobb as the “angel in the outfield.”

Even more tellingly the narrative glossed over the dubious process by which Lee the Braves and local business insiders worked in secret for months until they could keep their secret no more.

The above commentary asserted several times that “Tim did the right thing.” But the glaring lack of transparency a bevy of investigations and ethics complaints and a rushed timeline without much of a chance to get meaningful feedback from the public are still gnawing.

This coming Thursday will mark the eighth anniversary that Lee announced a proposed 30-year memorandum of understanding with the Atlanta Braves to help construct a stadium in the Cumberland area.

In that agreement Cobb would commit to a $300 million subsidy—taxpayer money—to help finance the ballpark as well as to regular capital maintenance public safety and other costs.

The four district members of the Cobb Board of Commissioners had exactly two weeks to digest a complicated long-term deal. The public had an even smaller window to ask questions of their elected officials at hastily arranged town hall meetings.

I covered these proceedings during my time at Patch a hyperlocal network founded by AOL a little more than a decade ago.

Bob Ott the former Cobb commissioner whose District 2 included the area along Windy Ridge Parkway and I-75 where the stadium would be built was thrust into a sudden and very glaring spotlight.

Always accessible Ott prided himself on holding informative town halls all over his Cumberland-East Cobb district.

But he made himself scarce for most of those two weeks inundated with messages and calls from constituents and the media like no other issue in his then-two terms in office.

On the night before the vote Ott held a town hall meeting not in his district but in the commissioners’ meeting room off the Square in Marietta.

I found that odd and asked him after it was over if he had made up his mind. He said he would do so when he pushed the button to vote.

Like the other town hall meetings I attended during that intense fortnight I realized that the Braves stadium deal was a done deal.

Twenty-four hours later in a cramped board room dominated by pro-stadium forces the commissioners approved the MOU with a 4-1 vote with Lisa Cupid now the chairwoman voting against.

Like many people who raised questions about the deal Cupid wasn’t opposed to the Braves coming to Cobb County or even having a partially publicly financed stadium built.

Like many of those same people I also wondered about the rushed secretive proceedings. Citizens groups as disparate as the Tea Party and Common Cause tried to get some answers but community scrutiny wasn’t well organized.

Lee defended the timeline and process by asserting that if Cobb didn’t act then the Braves would go elsewhere.

But as longtime Braves executive John Schuerholz admitted not long after the Cobb vote the team didn’t have another venue in mind after wanting to leave the city of Atlanta after nearly 50 years.

In other words the Braves played Cobb like Max Fried toyed with the Astros’ lineup on Tuesday setting down the commissioners in almost perfect order.

The timing of all this is important to remember as Cobb and much of the nation were starting to come out of the recession.

Commissioners JoAnn Birrell and Helen Goreham were doing verbal cartwheels from the moment the proposed stadium deal was announced smitten by the catnip of economic development that has tempted elected officials everywhere.

You can love the Braves as I have for most of my life and still hate the way that stadium deal came down.

You can be excited about the dining and entertainment options at The Battery Atlanta which the Braves have financed to the tune of nearly $400 million and wonder why the franchise still needed the public’s “help” to build a ball park.

The process stunk to high heaven lacked even a modicum of transparency gave no thought to a referendum and was followed by lame excuse-making.

Lee paid the ultimate political price when he was ousted in the 2016 Republican primary by Mike Boyce and didn’t get to enjoy the ultimate payoff of his stadium efforts. He died two years ago of cancer at the age of 62.

After the stadium opened in 2017 the Cobb Chamber of Commerce commissioned an economic impact study proclaiming a nearly $19 million annual benefit to the county.

One of the more vocal critics of such claims Kennesaw State University economics professor J.C. Bradbury noted in an op-ed during the World Series that one can cheer for the Braves and not get caught up in such runaway economic development fever.

Not wanting to rain on a parade but I feel the same way. The economic “home run” that was promised Cobb citizens still hasn’t been realized and shouldn’t be conflated with success on the baseball field.

When a public official is hailed for doing something “right” without that individual being examined for how he/she conducted public business that’s more than blind cheerleading.

The ends never justify the means especially public officials spending tax dollars and not giving the citizens much of a say.

Holding elected officials—or the legacies of those who are no longer with us or who are out office—to account isn’t just about determining if what they did was the right (or wrong) thing to do.

It’s also scrutinizing how they do it that should matter.

A clip from that evening that was shared on TikTok by someone with the username @loupastore27 shows a young fan tossing his baseball to Trump in hopes of getting it signed.

The former president catches the ball and asks a nearby agent for a pen. After signing the baseball Trump throws it back to the fan.

The video shows that when he tossed the ball back he pinged another youngster on the head.

According to TMZ the boy wasn't injured.

The young fan might make some money from the signed ball should he choose to sell it. TMZ Sports said in May 2020 that Trump-signed baseballs had sold for $2000 to $3000.

Trump has previously boasted about his baseball prowess. ""I was supposed to be a pro baseball player"" he wrote in a passage for a book in 2004 according to Slate. ""At the New York Military Academy I was captain of the baseball team. I worked hard like everyone else but I had good talent.""

In 2013 the Slate report said he tweeted that he was ""said to be the best bball player in N.Y. State.""

Hennepin Technical College has around 150 veterans on campus and 70 of those veterans use benefits earned while serving. To help students utilize those benefits Hennepin Tech offers one-on-one help to help navigate resources.

“We have all the services offered for them” said Tara Clinkscales veteran certifying official at Hennepin Tech. “We are there for them for that paperwork piece. We have a veterans resource center open during college campus hours and are just being able to show them that support.”

This year for Veterans Day the college is encouraging veterans to use the benefits they have earned. Some of those benefits could also include tuition books fees and even housing expenses.

An example of that assistance can be seen in Clinkscales helping a new veteran named Tyler Herbruck who has been a civilian for about six months.

“I helped Tyler figuring out veterans benefits” explained Clinkscales. “He needed assistance with where do I start? He’s in that big room once they get discharged and they tell him he has all these benefits and doesn’t know what to do with them.”

Herbruck calls the transition between the military and civilian life “flawless” only because of the systems in place both in the military and at the college.

“Because you are looking at all these options seeing where to go so having that person in the background to help you out big changer to the game when you are out there and actually starting to go to college” said Herbruck.

Herbruck served in the Marines for six years and is now looking forward to a career in fluid power.

“Being in the military I knew I wanted to do hands on. It’s where I’ve always excelled” said Herbruck. “Just being able to see a physical process turn into something that I’ve created has been rewarding for me.”

Stenciled on one of the T-shirts was in all caps BIG CHEETAH 24 — the Tech linebacker's nickname and uniform number. The other fan's T-shirt bore a large facial image of Morgenstern what an artist might sketch from a head shot of the big senior from New York.

To the extent a viewer might have given it any thought he probably didn't think of this: Morgenstern gets a small commission from sales of those shirts ones produced and marketed by an Austin-based company with whom Morgenstern connected once state legislatures and the NCAA gave their OK this summer for college athletes to profit off their name image and likeness.

Before he transferred last year to Tech Morgenstern used to choose that very subject for some of his class assignments.

""I wrote a few papers about it when I was an undergrad at Duke University"" he said ""so I definitely had strong feelings for it. I'm glad that student-athletes are able to finally profit off their name image and likeness because they do bring so much value. I felt like they were unduly impeded from accessing the market being able to capitalize on their NIL. So I think it's really great that they're able to do that.""

On July 1 college sports entered a new era with its athletes able to make money off endorsements autographs public appearances giving lessons and creating content among other endeavors. Newly enacted laws in about half the states paved the way and the NCAA opted to stand down rather than try to punish players engaging in NIL activity.

Athletes may reach out to businesses and vice versa. A university's athletics department may not broker deals but an athlete is required to disclose to the school NIL-related opportunities he or she is considering.

Texas Tech's numbers

Tech senior associate athletics director Amy Heard said recently her office had received about 140 such disclosures from about 80 Tech athletes at least one from 11 of its teams. Most have come from football men's basketball baseball and soccer players.

Of the 80 athletes Heard said 35 are football players. The number of NIL opportunities presented to Tech athletes and the number of athletes receiving such opportunities she said is higher because not all athletes are taking deals they're offered.

Colin Schooler signed in early August with the Radegen sports and entertainment agency less for what it can do for him now than in the future.

""I'm not necessarily using it as a way to make a quick buck here and there"" the Red Raiders' linebacker said. ""I'm more using it as a building block to start a foundation of what can come.

""As a team we've kind of come to a consensus that winning is the most important thing here and the more you win the more opportunities there will be for NIL.

More:Tech enhances NIL profile with group licensing deal

""And it's a gift and a curse the way you look at it. Players can get more caught up in the NIL than football so I feel like especially when we have 18-year-old kids living by themselves for the first time it can be tempting to only focus on that.""

Schooler says he's ""kind of waiting"" before jumping into an NIL deal.

""More building a foundation building connections and learning the way how it goes"" he said ""rather than going out and signing something quick that I don't know much about.""

Rustic Furniture Warehouse in Lubbock has run commercials on local television throughout this season featuring the Red Raiders' Erik Ezukanma who went into this weekend third in the Big 12 in catches and second in receiving yards.

During a session with the media this past week Ezukanma wore a stocking cap bearing his personal logo: his EE initials offset in stairstep fashion and separated by a lightning bolt. A marketing company helped the Tech wide receiver with the branding and authorization completing the process in the past couple of weeks.

There's now a website up and running erikezukanma.co that advertises T-shirts jerseys sweaters hoodies caps beanies joggers and shorts bearing his logo. As is the case with the apparel that bears Morgenstern's likenesses Ezukanma can legally earn a commission from sales off his website.

Senior cornerback Adrian Frye said before the season started he wouldn't mind doing what he could to help out a small business but he had not spent much time pursuing NIL opportunities.

""I just feel like if the time comes where somebody wants to use me to promote their brand and things like that then I'll respond. I'll accept it"" Frye said. ""I haven't really been reaching out very much. I reached out to one or two companies but they're mainly like my friends' companies.""

Tech quarterback Tyler Shough has missed the past five games with a broken collarbone but the transfer from Oregon was one of the first Red Raiders given multiple NIL offers to sort through. His appeal for promotional purposes was plain to see: He arrived at Tech this spring having already been a power-five conference starter for Oregon not to mention being 6-foot-5 and with pro potential.

More:Will athletes' new college cash flow impact team chemistry?

Shough said in August he has done NIL activity locally with 1000 Degrees Pizza and Cardinal's Sport Center also with the Raising Cane's chicken fingers chain restaurant and ""some trading-card stuff nationally."" He also looped in his offensive linemen to be able to receive complementary meals on another agreement.

Like Schooler Shough said he believes more in what he can earn in the future than in the short-term.

""Also within the locker room I've been doing everything I can to spread the wealth"" Shough said before the season. ""And I really haven't been doing that much compared to a lot of other quarterbacks around the nation who have signed marketing agents.""

Heard said disclosed compensation to Tech athletes with NIL agreements indicates merchandise discounts codes and traditional cash compensation.

A little less than 38% of the disclosures involve social media with nearly 20% being disclosed as an endorsement.

""It'll be interesting"" Heard said. ""I think it's going to continue to keep growing. I think students are going to get more active. Businesses are going to continue to get engaged.""

Unintended consequences

Those opposed to college athletes profiting from NIL suggest it will lead to dissension and jealousy in the locker room. Tech players had mixed opinions on that.

""Everyone understands they're not going to get the same opportunities"" center Dawson Deaton said. ""Like me as a center I'm not going to get the same deals as Tyler our quarterback and Henry (Colombi) and those guys. I understand that and I think everyone on the team has done a good job of being together in that aspect.""

Early on Deaton agreed to do social-media promotions for The WagBar an American Wagyu beef snack and for Roundhill Investments a New York-based firm.

Frye said the potential for locker-room issues is present ""but I feel like that's for guys that don't really have that bond and really aren't close with each other.

""I mean Tyler Shough just got here and he has name image likeness opportunities where I'm not jealous of him. I'm really happy for him because that gives him a chance to promote his brand make his name have a statement and then on top of that he gets to help companies benefit as well.

""I'm not a guy to hate on somebody's else's upbringing and stuff like that. You've got to be a negative person to let that affect you.""

Morgenstern said he can understand the contention among those opposed to NIL ""but at the end of the day"" he said ""I believe you're worth your market value.

""And if you're going to say that about football specifically then you can say that in the work environment. Why are people paid differently? It's what's your value what do you bring what do companies want to get from you and what value can you extract from them?""

One player's experience

Jacob Morgenstern and a classmate during his days at Duke once did a 20-page paper single-spaced on the NCAA. They researched the concept of amateurism and how the NCAA adhered to it especially under Walter Byers the sanctioning body's first executive director who served from 1951 to 1988.

""It seemed wrong to me that student-athletes were able to be stripped of their intellectual property rights and to be able to make a living simply because the NCAA said so"" Morgenstern said. ""They were making something that was not illegal illegal to student-athletes specifically.

""If you apply that to any other market you can't do that. You can't tell an amateur actor that they can't go and give acting lessons to make some money but for some reason student-athletes had those right stripped from them. So I was very passionate about that.""

Lo and behold the loosening of the restrictions took place before Morgenstern's college career ended.

The T-shirts bearing Morgenstern's nickname and likeness are done by Last Stand Hats based in Austin. He's one of 17 athletes — others are from Texas Stephen F. Austin and Texas State — whose apparel with catchy designs is advertised on the company's website.

Morgenstern had two NIL opportunities rejected. Both were from beverage companies with whom he could not engage because their products would be considered competitors and in conflict with Texas Tech's contract with Coca-Cola.

""I think we're still working through a lot of the kinks"" Morgenstern said. ""Some offers that I've had have been rejected through compliance because of nuances and technical (considerations) I guess things with the state of Texas and whatnot.

""Hopefully we'll be able to have greater access to a full market in the near future. But I do ultimately think it's a good thing that the ball got rolling and student-athletes can access the market.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwtc3BvcnRzLWdlb3JnaWEtbWlhbWktaHVycmljYW5lcy1mb290YmFsbC1qZWZmLXNpbXMtZjJkODk4NWZmOGMzMmNiMGZkZTUxMGZjMTNiMDAxZDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another close one: Miami rallies beats Georgia Tech 33-30,"MIAMI GARDENS Fla. (AP) — Another week another close game for Miami.

To the Hurricanes another win was all that mattered.

Tyler Van Dyke threw three touchdown passes Charleston Rambo had 210 receiving yards to nearly break the Miami single-game record and the Hurricanes continued their second-half surge with a 33-30 win over Georgia Tech on Saturday.

Van Dyke completed 22 of 34 passes for 389 yards becoming the first Miami quarterback since Bernie Kosar in 1984 with three consecutive games of at least 325 yards through the air. And they’ve come in three consecutive wins as Miami continues trying to shake off a 2-4 start.

“What they’ve learned is they can manage any situation” said Miami coach Manny Diaz whose team has played five consecutive games decided by four points or less the first such streak in school history.

Jaylan Knighton ran for a career-best 162 yards and a score for Miami (5-4 3-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) which visits rival Florida State next week with a chance to secure bowl-eligibility and improve its hopes in the ACC’s Coastal race.

Diaz said he allowed players a whole minute or two postgame to enjoy the win before making the annual announcement: “It’s Florida State week” he said immediately turning the page.

Rambo had seven catches falling just 10 yards shy of matching the Miami record of 220 yards set by Eddie Brown in 1984 and raved about both Knighton and Van Dyke afterward.

“TVD. TV Dinner. That boy is going to make plays” Rambo said.

Keyshawn Smith’s touchdown catch with 10:27 left put Miami ahead for good and Mike Harley also had a scoring grab for the Hurricanes — who have played a FBS-leading six games decided by four points or less this season going 4-2 in those contests.

Jeff Sims threw for 194 yards and a touchdown for Georgia Tech (3-6 2-5). Jordan Mason had a 71-yard rushing score for the Yellow Jackets while Jahmyr Gibbs had a 50-yard TD catch and Jaylon King had a fumble return for another touchdown for Georgia Tech.

It was the fifth loss by nine points or less this season for Georgia Tech the third by six points or less.

“Guys battled” Yellow Jackets coach Geoff Collins said “They fought all the way until the end. It hurts. But we have to get over the hump of these one-score games.”

Miami got touchdowns out of its first two possessions for the second straight week going up 14-0 midway through the opening quarter on scoring throws from Van Dyke to Harley (8 yards) and Rambo (35 yards).

That’s when slippery ball syndrome started for the Hurricanes. Miami got only three points from its next six possessions fumbling the ball away three times getting one field goal missing another and punting once.

And it nearly cost them with Georgia Tech leading 21-17 at the half and holding a 28-24 edge going into the fourth.

“We never got down on ourselves and I think that really helped us” Van Dyke said.

The Yellow Jackets were down 33-28 after Smith’s touchdown but got a safety out of Miami’s conversion try when Juanyeh Thomas intercepted Van Dyke’s throw and returned it 100 yards for two points — the first such play by a Georgia Tech player since Ken Swilling did it against Duke Oct. 28 1989.

“Quite an extraordinary game” Diaz said.

THE TAKEAWAY

Georgia Tech: Gibbs is on an amazing big-play roll. He’s had a play of at least 50 yards now in five consecutive games — a 71-yard catch vs. Pitt on Oct. 2 a 77-yard catch vs. Duke on Oct. 9 a 71-yard rush vs. Virginia on Oct. 23 a 61-yard rush vs. Virginia Tech last week and the 50-yard touchdown reception early in the third quarter Saturday.

Miami: The Hurricanes’ three first-half fumbles lost were the most by an ACC team in a game this season and tied for the most by any team nationally so far this season in a first half. The last time an ACC team lost more fumbles in any half of a conference game was Nov. 12 2016 when Virginia lost four second-half fumbles against Miami.

THE SERIES

Miami’s win knotted the all-time series between the teams 13-13.

The Canes were up 14-0 and it appeared they were on track to an easy and blowout win. But a few speed bumps came into play when the Canes’ ball security became a real issue in the first half. The Canes had three first-half fumbles by Charleston Rambo Elijah Arroyo and Jaylan Knighton. Jeff Simms’ poor passes for most of the game (he only 73 yards passing in the first half) fumbles by the Canes and poor tackling became the difference between a sizable lead and a tight ball game.

One of those fumbles was even returned for a touchdown by Georgia Tech. The game remained close deep into the 4th quarter and also included a disastrous 2-pt conversion interception by Georgia Tech which was returned to the house. In the end the defense made the play with 3 minutes left in the 4th quarter. Zach McCLoud got there for a sack on 3rd down to give Miami the ball back. The Canes offense then went three-and-out but the Canes defense stood tall again (thanks to a Jeff Sims’ knee on the grass). After four lead changes in the game the Canes finally pulled out the 33-30 win.

Here are the three stars from the wildly competitive win over Georgia Tech that helped lead to Miami’s first win over the Yellow Jackets since 2017.

Third Star: Jaylan Knighton and Avantae Williams

I could’ve easily picked Knighton solo here who had a day behind great blocks from Jarrid Williams and the rest of the offensive line. But Avantae Williams really had a remarkable interception on a 3rd and 15 play by the Yellow Jackets. He went right through the WR and high-pointed the ball to make an insane pick. He also had a 31-yard interception return on the play and made a key tackle on at punt return by GT with 50 seconds left in the game.

Avantae Williams first career interception pic.twitter.com/gHA4k9bBe2 — Grantlong (@Grantlonggg) November 6 2021

Now on to Knighton who continued his successful stretch of games. He finished with 32 rushes for 162 yards and 1 touchdown. It was his 100-yard running game of the season. We just have to stop rushing him short-yardage and 4th down plays (please).

Second Star: Charleston Rambo

Charleston Rambo almost eclipsed 200 yards by the middle of the third quarter. That’s the kind of day he had. The guy is pure electric with the ball in his hands (as long as he doesn’t fumble) and a true playmaker. He got into the end zone in the first quarter on a busted coverage down the right sideline by Georgia Tech. And it was his 60-yard catch off a flea flicker play on the first play of the second half which sparked the Canes’ second half comeback.

First Star: Tyler Van Dyke

Tyler Van Dyke’s first drive of the game started within the 10 yard line and ended with a one-handed TD grab by Mike Harley. On the next possession he hit Charleston Rambo on the right sideline for a 35-yard TD on third down. He came out dealing today. He now has 10 TD passes in his first 9 starts. He finished the first half with 13 of 23 for 238 yards and 2 touchdowns. His final stats were 22 for 34 for 389 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also showed some guts today and even scampered for a few key first downs with this legs.

Kansas News Service

GARDEN CITY — Outside an old white two-story house in downtown Garden City dozens of people stand in a loose row that spills out of the driveway and onto the sidewalk.

Many of them show up here at Emmaus House — the largest food pantry in southwest Kansas — every Wednesday and Friday. And they walk away with free boxes filled with everything from frozen bacon to salad kits to frosted cakes that sustain their families for another week.

Much of the food in those boxes was donated by the area’s largest employer Tyson Foods. Its meatpacking plant has lifted Garden City to new heights of prosperity in the four decades since it opened on the outskirts of town.

But for many of the workers who hold down the tough jobs in that giant slaughterhouse the reality isn’t always so rosy.

Nearly half of the people who stand in line at this food pantry on a given week come from families employed at Tyson’s meatpacking plant.

Garden City going through growing pains

The scene at Emmaus House illustrates the ongoing growing pains Garden City has faced during its transformation from a small farming community to a meatpacking boom town. In the decades since Tyson’s plant opened the number of jobs in Garden City has skyrocketed but the per capita incomes in town have lost pace with the rest of Kansas.

And the number of people living in poverty and seeking food assistance has soared.

“A lot of people think ‘Well you're working at Tyson so you're making really good money’ said Robin Marsh Emmaus House’s executive director. “By the time you pay your rent by the time you pay your utilities … they don't have enough for food.”

Tyson recently raised starting pay at this plant to $20 per hour but many workers' families still meet the poverty income guidelines that qualify them for food assistance from Emmaus House.

And that group keeps growing.

Meals served by nonprofit almost quadruple in 10 years

The number of meals Emmaus House served nearly quadrupled between 2000 and 2010. On a single day roughly 160 families pick up grocery boxes from the food bank. When demand peaked earlier in the pandemic that number jumped to 400.

And Tyson — which directly provides roughly one of every five jobs in the county — sits at the center of what’s both wildly prosperous and persistently challenging about life in modern Garden City. Without the massive beef processing operation this small city would likely be withering like so many other Great Plains communities.

But when many workers at the area’s largest employer can’t afford their families’ basic needs the question of whether or not Garden City has found success grows more complicated.

“It's always positive when you see growth” Marsh said. “But if you look behind the camera there are issues.”

Thousands of new workers followed plant's opening

When what was then the world’s largest meatpacking plant opened here in 1980 Garden City had a problem: It needed thousands of new workers.

At the time the town had roughly 18000 residents and virtually no unemployment. So it opened its doors to immigrants and refugees with an assist from the company that originally ran the giant slaughterhouse IBP.

IBP recruited many of the 2000 south Asian refugees who migrated to Garden City around that time. It even broadcast help wanted ads on border town radio stations to reach potential workers in Mexico.

“They followed the theory from the movie ‘Field of Dreams’: ‘Build it and they will come’” said Don Stull a former University of Kansas professor. “And they did come.”

Workforce grew faster than housing market social services

Stull studied the meatpacking industry’s impact on Garden City for three decades as an anthropology professor and author. He said the plant’s workforce grew faster than the town’s housing market and social service systems could handle.

“Jobs come with costs” Stull said. “And they don't talk about the costs.”

And because the meatpacking jobs had an annual turnover rate of nearly 100% the company had to keep recruiting new waves of workers. Over and over again.

In the plant’s first five years Garden City pulled in 6000 new residents. But the town didn’t have anywhere to put them.

The situation became so dire that city leaders held a press conference imploring residents to open their homes to workers who had nowhere else to sleep. A year after opening the plant surveyed its employees and found that one-third were paying excessive rent and one out of 20 workers was living in a car or motel.

Hundreds of mobile homes line Garden City's east side

For the immigrants and refugees who come to town to join the meatpacking plant’s 3000-plus workforce today the outlook hasn’t gotten much sunnier.

“Once they get here they’re like ‘Where are we going to live? Crap we can't afford a $900 house payment’” said Marsh of Emmaus House. “Those are the struggles that we still deal with and always have. … And if you don't believe me drive out to IBP trailers.”

That’s a plot with hundreds of mobile homes lined up in long rows on the east side of town. IBP pushed the city to rezone the land in the 1980s specifically to house some of the plant’s early employees.

And it’s still there today. Marsh says it's common for a home there to have a hole in the floor. Or no windows.

But residents often can’t afford to move to a better place — if they could even find one.

City manager Matt Allen said the area continues to be about 600 to 700 housing units short of demand. And that need grows by around 10% each year.

“The answer is pretty simple. … We need more houses” Allen said. “It's the ‘How do you get those?’ That's the difficulty.”

Community members fill in gaps of safety net

Housing is far from the only growing pain that continues to strain Garden City in the wake of the meatpacking plant’s arrival.

Law enforcement hospitals and schools have had to bridge language gaps between critical services and the dozens of languages residents speak.

In 2000 half the students in Garden City’s public school system received free or reduced lunch because of their families’ low incomes. Today that number’s up to two-thirds.

The Garden City area also ranks as among the state’s lowest for quality of life and health outcomes — and the social and economic factors that drive them. For example adults in Finney County are about twice as likely to lack a primary care doctor and 50% more likely to be in poor health compared to the state average.

And without the same resources that big cities have the extra work to make sure people don’t fall through the cracks often falls to regular folks who choose to step in and help.

People like Dominican Sister Janice Thome.

“We don’t have to ever worry about having enough to do” she said. “There’s always going to be plenty.”

In Garden City 'The world grows here'

Most every week for the past 25 years she has pulled her compact car up to Emmaus House and filled it with boxes of groceries. Then she starts her route delivering the food to a rotating cast of families scattered across Garden City who can’t afford it and aren’t able to come to the food bank.

Just about the only time she doesn’t do this is when she’s busy lending a hand to one of the community’s other many needs. The previous week she drove someone to Kansas City to meet with an immigration lawyer.

“It’s worth the effort to do all of this” she said “because look how we can sustain people’s lives better people's lives.”

Forty years after the town debated whether or not to welcome the meatpacking plant and its thousands of immigrant and refugee workers Thome said it’s hard to find someone who doesn’t think pushing for the plant was the right decision.

Pretty much everyone she knows in Garden City today values how the steady stream of new arrivals keeps the town alive — not just economically but also with a cultural vibrancy that has made the town a richer place for everyone.

For Thome it’s all part of living in a city that boasts the slogan: “The world grows here.”

“We're living it” she said. “And I think it's wonderful.”

But as Garden City keeps growing the patchwork of support that takes care of so many of its vulnerable residents will continue to face strains.

Across the street from the mobile home park IBP built for example another food conglomerate is building a new ground beef plant that will add a couple hundred more jobs to the city’s meat workforce over the next two years.

Boom problems still beat depopulation

But as rural towns across the U.S. lose residents having to find ways to deal with the growing pains still beats depopulation and a shrinking economy.

“Whatever challenges exist I found that in the vast majority of these smaller locations refugees — and immigrants more broadly — were an absolute lifeline” said Pablo Bose who teaches about the geography of race at the University of Vermont. “I actually heard that particular statement like ‘These newcomers are a lifeline.’”

Bose has researched refugee resettlement in America for the past decade. His research shows that community-based systems for supporting new immigrants in small towns can be highly effective because they get more people to buy in.

But the downside is that big cities with a longer history of immigration tend to have more systems in place to support newcomers. In rural areas makeshift community safety nets can fray if they’re missing just one key person. Someone like sister Janice.

“When that individual gets burnt out or retires … you have to go through a whole process of getting somebody up to speed” Bose said. “It makes it precarious.”

Community reliant on Tyson Foods decisions

Tyson Foods said in a statement that its southwest Kansas employees are ""critical to (the company's) success"" and touted the plant's recent initiatives aimed at boosting worker satisfaction such as increased pay and flexible scheduling.

But when so much of Garden City’s fortunes ride the whims of a multinational conglomerate headquartered in another state it puts a lot of what the community has gained at risk.

The city has tried to bring in different industries but city manager Matt Allen said that meatpacking remains the backbone of the local economy.

“We’re still largely dependent on Tyson not only being in operation but being in operation near full capacity” he said. “Everything else sort of depends on that.”

And at any point Tyson could choose to close or relocate this plant entirely if it makes sense for its business.

That’s not some far-fetched hypothetical for Garden City — the town has actually been through that before.

ConAgra fire left 2300 out of work

There used to be a second meatpacking plant here run by another giant food company ConAgra. That one suddenly shut down on Christmas Day in 2000 after a fire put 2300 people out of work overnight and sent local social services agencies scrambling.

When Garden City’s leaders traveled to ConAgra headquarters the following spring to essentially beg the company to come back its executives refused to meet with them. The plant never reopened.

“They didn't really give a damn about Garden City” said Stull the KU professor “and I think that's true of these multinational corporations in general.”

So whether it’s shoring up the city’s economic future or caring for the needs of its residents Stull said Garden City and other meatpacking towns can’t look to the companies that run the plants to save the day.

“They’re not in the business of providing housing or health care” he said. “They're in the business of making meat.”

Tyson’s Berryville plant cooks 716000 pounds of poultry products daily. Its pre-treatment operation handles about 750000 gallons of wastewater daily. This wastewater includes food ingredients cooking oil animal fat marinades and cleaning chemicals from daily sanitation. Despite this the pre-treatment facility discharges water well below the permit limits established by its public wastewater treatment facility.

According to Tyson's application for the award the pre-treatment facility must handle both soluble and insoluble contaminants. This means the facility must rely heavily on the biological removal of soluble contaminants to meet its permit requirements.

Insoluble contaminants are removed prior to the biological treatment process with a dissolved air floatation (DAF) process along with polymers. Soluble contaminants are removed in the 1.3 million gallon aeration basin. Solids generated from this process are removed in a second DAF and polymer treatment.

The plant is also working on upgrades that would enhance its performance including a new aeration basin and larger equalization tanks. These improvements are planned Tyson’s fiscal 2022. It may also add a screw press to reduce the amount of land applied sludge coming from the plant.

Handling oil and marinade

Berryville takes extra steps to capture harder-to-treat substances like marinades and oil.

The cooking process uses marinades glazes breading and batter. The facility trains workers to minimize the amount of these ingredients finding their way into wastewater collection. Because of this about 100000 to 150000 pounds of these products are diverted from the wastewater stream weekly.

Cooking oil is inherently tough to filter in a fast-paced production environment. Ineffective filtration results in oil prone to scorching – because some degree of solids remain in the oil – and filtered solids which contain too much oil to be disposed of in a landfill.

In 2020 it began using a Micron-Pro Filtration Automation Inc. oil filter to replace older inefficient filters. These units further decreased scorching issues allowing the facility to reuse oil and reduce new oil purchases. Filter cake produced by this new process is used as an animal feed ingredient.

Police responded after 6:00 AM to the plant at 501 N. Elk Run Road.

Company officials say police searched the plant and gave the all clear. Operations then resumed as normal.

Tyson released the following statement to TV9:

“Earlier today we investigated an alleged bomb threat at our Waterloo Iowa facility. The safety of our team members is always our top priority and we take these threats very seriously. All team members were immediately evacuated as a precaution. We want to thank the Waterloo Police Department for their quick response.”

An election takes place they examine the results and suddenly lament their poor showing with rural voters. It has happened time and again and yet the party has neither a solution to the problem nor it seems a commitment to solving it.

The concerns have arisen again after Tuesday’s elections in Virginia. Democrat Terry McAuliffe got wiped out in rural areas of the state as Republican Glenn Youngkin rolled up margins and turnout in the gubernatorial race that approached or eclipsed those of President Donald Trump in 2020. Rural Virginia was not the only reason McAuliffe lost but his performance in those counties highlighted the party’s continuing weakness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vcGptZWRpYS5jb20vcmljay1tb3Jhbi8yMDIxLzExLzA3L3doeS10aGUtdmFjY2luZS1tYW5kYXRlLWlzLWlsbGVnYWwtYW5kLXdoeS1pdC13aWxsLXN0aWxsLWJlLWltcG9zZWQtbjE1MzA0NDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the Vaccine Mandate Is Illegal and Why It Will Still Be Imposed,"Yesterday’s ruling in a federal appeals court in New Orleans granting a temporary injunction against the vaccine mandate was encouraging to those who oppose the federal overreach it represents.

But despite solid arguments against the mandate’s legality it will likely go forward anyway. The injunction imposed by the appeals court yesterday was temporary. At some point an appeals court will rule that the requirements of the mandate can go forward while the OSHA rule is litigated.

That’s going to take a while. In fact the delay between cause and effect is part of the Biden administration’s strategy. By the time the issue is decided by the Supreme Court—almost certainly in favor of the states suing the administration—it may well be next fall. The suing states could ask for an expedited Supreme Court hearing but that’s almost never granted.

By then the “temporary” legality of the mandate will have resulted in millions of people being forced to get jabbed or lose their jobs. Biden will have accomplished his mission employers will be relieved of the burden of having to enforce an unpopular rule and we can all go back to living our normal lives just like we did before the pandemic began right?

That’s the plan anyway.

The mandate is illegal because the OSHA standard it’s based on is not being met. The federal government assumes the authority to impose the mandate based on the “general welfare” clause of the Constitution and its clearly defined power to regulate interstate commerce. But the administrative law under which OSHA operates only justifies federal action in the workplace such as a vaccine mandate under certain specific conditions.

And the epidemic doesn’t meet them.

The Federalist:

“Courts are skeptical because the law demands it” the attorneys general wrote in a letter to Biden in September. “To justify an emergency temporary standard OSHA must determine that ‘employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards…’ and it must conclude that ‘such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.’ You cannot plausibly meet the high burden of showing that employees in general are in grave danger.” Although the Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda said the Labor Department was “confident in its legal authority” to issue the OSHA-enforced vaccine mandate Republican-led groups have been questioning and denying its legality since it was implemented on Nov. 4.

“The federal government can’t just unilaterally impose medical policy under the guise of workplace regulation” Governor DeSantis said on Thursday.

The Washington Post points out that vaccine mandates increase vaccination rates. Does that mean they should be legal?

Mandates appear to have helped drive an increase in vaccinations. United Airlines which had one of the strictest mandates for a major air carrier said its employee vaccination rate increased to more than 99 percent. Delta which used financial penalties and testing requirements saw the employee vaccination rate jump to 90 percent from 75 percent. Tyson Foods said recently that at least 96 percent of its employees were vaccinated in advance of its Nov. 1 deadline — up from under 50 percent before it announced the mandate in August. Many hospitals in New York saw vaccination rates increase to more than 95 percent by the deadline of the state’s mandate for health-care workers up from the 70 percent to 80 percent range before the rule was announced. In California major hospitals saw vaccination rates increase to about 90 percent after a similar albeit slightly less stringent mandate.

“The requirement is supported by a majority of the American public according to public opinion surveys and is a critical step to increasing vaccination rates and getting the pandemic under more firm control according to public health experts” writes the Post. Are we to surrender our judgment and liberties to the whims of public opinion or the opinion of “experts”?

The Biden administration’s cynical strategy to impose a mandate they know won’t pass constitutional muster with the Supreme Court may indeed work. But considering what we’re losing bin the process it seems a ghastly price to pay for “normalcy.”"

Rather it is their current stadium that was known as “Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards” before becoming PSINet Stadium and then eventually M&T Bank Stadium. My apologies for the error.

Original story follows.

It’s time for our weekly look at the history between the Minnesota Vikings and their opponents for this week. On Sunday the purple will head to the east coast to take on the other purple team in the NFL as they battle the Baltimore Ravens and the history between these two teams is relatively short.

When the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore in 1996 they left all of the team’s previous records in Cleveland and started from scratch with a brand new history. Because of that these two franchises have only met six times. Four of those games have taken place in Baltimore where they will meet on Sunday.

As always the numbers for this piece are brought to you by the good folks at Pro Football Reference.

It’s been a while since the Vikings managed a victory in Baltimore as you can see from the numbers above.

The last two times these teams got together was in October of 2017 at U.S. Bank Stadium. It was a battle of field goals in the first half as Kai Forbath and Justin Tucker took turns putting the football through the uprights when their teams couldn’t get into the end zone. Forbath came out ahead in the first half with the Vikings taking a 9-6 lead into the locker room. Forbath would wind up with six field goals on the afternoon with Minnesota’s lone touchdown coming on a 29-yard run from Latavius Murray in the third quarter (after which Forbath oddly enough missed the extra point). The Ravens didn’t manage a touchdown until the final play of the game and it wasn’t enough as the Vikings walked away with a 24-16 victory.

Everyone remembers the last time these two teams got together in Baltimore. It was a snowy Sunday afternoon and for much of the game the biggest story for either team was Adrian Peterson leaving with an injury in the first quarter. The offense was pretty limited for both teams as the Vikings took a 12-7 lead early in the fourth quarter on an 8-yard pass from Matt Cassel to Jerome Simpson. Then with two minutes to go everything went crazy.

Joe Flacco 1-yard touchdown pass to Dennis Pitta

Toby Gerhart 41-yard touchdown run

Jacoby Jones 77-yard kickoff return for a touchdown

Matt Cassel 79-yard touchdown pass to Cordarrelle Patterson

Joe Flacco 9-yard touchdown pass to Marlon Brown

With that a game that had gone into the final two minutes as a 12-7 Minnesota lead turned into a 29-26 Baltimore victory. As the video says it may have been the craziest final two minutes of any NFL game ever and it’s certainly up there on the list of games that I’ve ever watched.

The Vikings’ only victory in Baltimore since the Ravens moved from Cleveland came back in the team’s incredible 1998 season. It was the second-to-last game of the regular season as Dennis Green brought the 13-1 Vikings into Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards. . . yes the Ravens originally played home games at the Orioles’ stadium (see correction at the top of the piece). . .to take on Ted Marchibroda’s 5-9 squad. Both teams lit up the scoreboard early including a first quarter that featured back-to-back kickoff returns for touchdowns. Patrick Johnson went 97 yards for the Ravens which was immediately followed by David Palmer going 88 yards for Minnesota. That made it 14-12 at the end of the first quarter but the Vikings’ offense then ran off the next 23 points including a touchdown reception each for Randy Moss and Cris Carter. By the time that Baltimore got on the scoreboard again they were down 35-20 and the Vikings held on to take the victory by a final score of 38-28.

That’s a quick look at the history between the Vikings and the Ravens heading into this weekend’s contest folks. We’ll see if the Vikings can’t get themselves to above .500 against the Ravens on Sunday afternoon."

Martinez got out of the car and threatened to call 911. She and the passenger had a hard time communicating because she doesn't know English.

Martinez believes that's what seemed to set him off. He punched her in the face and ran off she said.

An Uber executive has lobbied Taxi & Limousine Commission chief Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk on the idea’s “potential” according to a September city lobbying disclosure.

The executive Josh Gold is an ally of Mayor de Blasio and a former lobbyist for the well-connected Hotel Trades Council.

No details of his discussion with Jarmoszuk were provided in the filing. Gold a public policy and communications director at Uber declined to comment.

New Yorkers took about half a million yellow taxi rides per day until 2014 when Uber and Lyft started to eat their lunch. Now New Yorkers take slightly under 100000 each day.

Through the TLC’s “E-Hail” program app users could potentially see yellow cabs as another option alongside the basic “UberX.”

On a quarterly earnings call Thursday with Wall Street analysts Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company as it grows would always have a need to recruit more drivers.

“I don’t think we’re ever going to have enough drivers” he said.

New York Taxi Workers Alliance leader Bhairavi Desai told The Post her 25000-member union which includes Uber and Lyft drivers would “remain open-minded.” Natan Dvir for NY Post

Uber and Lyft daily ridership in the city is down double digits over the past few months according to TLC data likely because of driver shortages. Low supply and high demand mean skyrocketing fares — and thousands of daily riders ditched the apps for yellow cabs according to the TLC data.

For instance New Yorkers taking Uber or Lyft to JFK Airport have griped at fares well above $100. Yellow taxis have a fixed rate of $52 to or from Manhattan and JFK. Intra-borough rides on the meter are sometimes just half of an Uber or Lyft ride when prices for the app-based rides “surge.”

New York Taxi Workers Alliance leader Bhairavi Desai told The Post her 25000-member union which includes Uber and Lyft drivers would “remain open-minded” to the idea of Uber-mediated hack hails.

The financials of the potential arrangement are unknown including whether the app would get a cut of cab rides it dispatches. Desai said Uber’s usual 25 percent commission for drivers wouldn’t work given the costs of operating a traditional taxi.

“I think they want to replace their volume” she said. “Especially in a moment when a lot of the drivers are not going back.”

New Yorkers could arrange yellow-taxi rides through Uber formerly known as Ubercab back in 2013. Desai believes Uber dropped yellow cabs once enough of its cars were on the road.

“Our thing is you have to protect full-time work. Whether it’s yellow-cab drivers or Uber and Lyft drivers we want to see standards lifted for all the drivers” she told The Post on Wednesday night outside City Hall where a cabbie hunger strike had just ended.

Uber is entertaining the idea of dispatching yellow cabs per a city lobbying disclosure.

New York City app users could potentially see taxi cabs as another option alongside ""UberX.""

It comes at a time when driver shortages plague the US economy amid an ongoing labor crisis.

Uber is looking into the possibility of dispatching New York City's famous yellow cabs from its app in addition to its usual private hire options.

A September city lobbying disclosure lists Uber executive Josh Gold as having a discussion with Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) chief Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk on ""the potential for a yellow taxi dispatch."" There are no further details given.

Per The New York Post Uber app users could potentially see yellow cabs as another option alongside ""UberX"" facilitated through the TLC's ""E-Hail"" program.

""As a regulatory agency the TLC meets frequently with all its Licensees to discuss ideas individually and including during our monthly Taxi Working Group convening"" a TLC spokesperson told The Post.

Uber and TLC did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Whether New York's cab drivers feel any appetite to pair up with Uber remains to be seen given they felt the app decimated their business in its first few years of operation.

It also comes at a time when ride-hailing apps struggle with a depleting labor pool fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I think they want to replace their volume"" New York Taxi Workers Alliance leader Bhairavi Desai told The Post. ""Especially in a moment when a lot of the drivers are not going back.""

Industries in all corners of the US economy from construction to hospitality have been hit hard by a crippling labor shortage. Insider had conversations with 22 current and former Uber and Lyft drivers across the US who revealed the reasons for not wanting to return to the apps.

Some drivers said they're simply waiting for more of the public to get vaccinated while others said they're holding out for better pay.

But as cities get moving again demand for cabs is growing. This combined with the shortage has led to price hikes.

In April Uber spent $250 million on ""boosted incentives and guarantees"" to persuade drivers to get back on the road Insider reported. In its third-quarter financial report released this week Uber reported a $2.4 billion loss mainly thanks to its investment in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. However its earnings were otherwise fairly positive with the firm reporting a 72% jump in revenue to $4.8 billion.







""Our early and decisive investments in driver growth are still paying dividends with drivers steadily returning to the platform leading to further improvement in the consumer experience"" said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi at the time.""

It is not yet known whether Uber would get a cut of taxi cab rides it dispatches but according to Desai the company's usual 25% commission would not work given the costs that come with operating a traditional taxi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vaG93LXRvL3RoZS1iZXN0LWFtYXpvbi1lY2hvLWFsZXhhLXNraWxscy1hbmQtaG93LXRvLWluc3RhbGwtdGhlbS810gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best Alexa Skills and commands 2021: the ultimate in Amazon Echo tips and tricks,"The Amazon Echo can make planning holidays or even the commute to work quick and easy. Here are the best Amazon Alexa skills for organizing your travels.

Uber Alexa skills

If you live somewhere with Uber coverage then you can use the Alexa Uber skill to quickly and easily arrange for a car to drive to your location and pick you up.

To start you'll need to install the Uber Alexa skill on your Amazon Echo (or similar Alexa-enabled device) and also use the Alexa app to set the location of your Amazon Echo (so the Uber driver knows where to pick you up from).

Once configured you can say ""Alexa ask Uber to request a ride"" and a car will be sent to your home. If it's taking its time say ""Alexa ask Uber where's my ride?"" to find out what the delay is.

Uber in action

Lyft Alexa skills

Lyft is another service that lets you call up drivers to pick you up and drop you off and just like Uber it has an Alexa skill as well.

With this skill up and running installed you can say ""Alexa ask Lyft to call a ride"" to request a driver. Other things you can ask include ""Alexa ask Lyft how much a ride to work will cost” ""Alexa ask Lyft where my ride is"" and ""Alexa ask Lyft to tip my driver 3 dollars.""

Kayak Alexa Skills

The Kayak Alexa app for the Amazon Echo allows you to use Alexa to help you plan a trip.

This skill can track flights (for example: ""Alexa ask Kayak when the flight from New York to Las Vegas lands"") and check prices – so ""Alexa ask Kayak how much it costs to fly from New York to Las Vegas"" maybe if you're in the mood for some gambling.

If you want some inspiration and are on a budget try ""Alexa ask Kayak where can I go for $500 dollars"".

Tube Status Alexa skill

The Tube Status Amazon Echo Skill is essential for London commuters enabling you to ask Alexa to check the status of underground train services in the UK capital.

UNP,Union Pacific Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd2FzaGluZ3Rvbm1vbnRobHkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMDcvYW10cmFrLWpvZS12cy10aGUtbW9kZXJuLXJvYmJlci1iYXJvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amtrak Joe vs. the Modern Robber Barons,"As expected when a chief executive nicknamed “Amtrak Joe” put together his signature infrastructure bill it contained an unprecedented sum for expanding rail service across the country: $60 billion over 10 years. Perhaps more surprisingly it attracted enough support from Republicans to pass the Senate in August. Though as of this writing Democrats in the House are divided over how and whether to tie the bill to other agendas it seems likely that Biden will eventually realize his ambition to tilt far more transportation dollars toward rail.

It’s a worthy goal. The bill promises to furnish a more convenient and environmentally friendly mode of travel between destinations that are far enough apart to make driving tedious but close enough together to make flying impossible or at best impractical. You might never use these new trains yourself but those who do will benefit you by creating less traffic congestion cleaner air and a cooler planet. Removing more freight from pavement-pounding long-haul semitrucks onto super-fuel-efficient trains will make driving safer and more pleasant and would yield huge reductions in carbon emissions.

But for any of this to happen on any meaningful scale the Biden administration will need to do more than just invest more public money in train travel. It will also need to reverse decades of deregulation lax antitrust enforcement and other policy blunders that have left modern-day robber barons in control of nearly all the nation’s highly monopolized railroad infrastructure just as they were in the worst days of the Gilded Age. Only this time the financiers aren’t presiding over an expanding rail system; they’re selling it off and permanently liquidating its assets for short-term economic gain.

Unless Biden takes on the financiers even maintaining Amtrak service let alone expanding it will become ridiculously expensive. Here’s an example that shows why.

Amtrak for decades offered train service along the Gulf Coast corridor between New Orleans and Mobile Alabama. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina badly damaged the tracks. The two giant corporate rail systems that own the line Norfolk Southern and CSX made the necessary repairs and within a year resumed running their own freight trains. But Amtrak service has never returned.

It is not that people in the region don’t want their Amtrak trains back. A broad coalition of civic and business leaders including Mississippi Republican Senator Roger Wicker has been trying for years to persuade the railroads to let Amtrak resume operating. They point to a study by the Trent Lott National Center at the University of Southern Mississippi that says restoring Amtrak service will boost tourism significantly greatly benefiting Mississippi’s beaches and casinos. They point to the report of a special Gulf Coast Working Group created by Congress that estimates the cost of resuming Gulf Coast passenger service at $5.4 million. They point to the fact that the Biden administration Amtrak and the state governments of Louisiana and Mississippi are all committed to furnishing the necessary operating funds.

But after five years of negotiations you still can’t take the train to Gulfport Biloxi Pascagoula or anywhere else along the Gulf Coast. CSX which controls most of the track along the route insists that restoring Amtrak service would interfere with the six to eight freight trains it runs daily along the coast. It’s an argument that rail corporations often deploy against passenger service.

The objection is absurd on its face. During World War II when troop and military freight trains crowded this route along with civilian freight traffic long since lost to trucks dispatchers still managed to move 11 scheduled passenger trains per day between Mobile and New Orleans. These included the storied “Pan American” of country music fame. And they did it using telegraphs and hand-operated semaphores not the efficient GPS technology available today.

CSX’s recalcitrance is a negotiating strategy to get Amtrak to either go away or pony up for huge infrastructure investments that would mostly benefit CSX itself. The railroad says restoring two Amtrak trains requires a second main track new sidings siding extensions yard bypasses and modernization of drawbridges. At one point CSX put the price tag at $2 billion—orders of magnitude more than estimates provided by the Federal Railway Administration and other independent experts.

Such maneuverings reflect the growing power of hedge funds and other “activist investors” over the railroad industry. In 2017 the financier Paul Hilal used his activist fund Mantle Ridge to buy a nearly $2 billion stake in CSX and win control of its board. Hilal used this power to depose CSX’s long-standing management and replace it with a team of downsizing specialists committed to boosting short-term profits by shrinking the railroad’s physical assets labor force and other expenses. The new focus on cost cutting and downsizing has seriously degraded CSX freight operations while also causing the company to take an impossibly hard line with Amtrak.

Exasperated by the railroads’ refusal to negotiate in good faith over the restoration of Gulf Coast service Amtrak has recently appealed to an independent federal agency the Surface Transportation Board. But deregulation has left the federal government with very limited control over railroad infrastructure. When Congress and the Nixon administration created Amtrak in 1970 they relieved railroad owners of their previous obligation to provide passenger service at their own expense. Half a century later the federal government has no clear legal standard to decide when freight railroads must grant Amtrak access to their track or what the terms of service will be. And since Amtrak owns track only between Boston and Washington and a few other places dependence on freight railroads is a huge obstacle to improving or expanding passenger rail service.

For example more than 10 years of studying and lobbying have been dedicated to the question of whether Amtrak will be permitted to run more than one round-trip train per day between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. Public policy makers must wrestle with many knotty problems; this shouldn’t be one of them. There’s plenty of track capacity. Amtrak ran two round-trip trains along the mostly three-track mainline as recently as 2004. But Norfolk Southern says today that bringing back that second train would create unworkable disruptions to its freight service. The railroad’s latest maneuver was to demand that the state of Pennsylvania pay for a study to calculate how much the public must pay Norfolk Southern for the necessary capital improvements such as a possible fourth track.

Another example is the drawn-out battle Amtrak and the public had to wage to restore passenger service between Boston and Portland Maine. By the time Amtrak came into being passenger service on the route had already been discontinued. To get it started again Amtrak as well as state and local governments had to agree to pay the railroad that owns the tracks tens of millions of dollars for capital improvements. It took another two years of litigation before the railroad now known as Pan Am would allow Amtrak to run its trains fast enough so people would want to ride them. A pending mergerbetween Pan Am and CSX now threatens the public’s considerable investment in that passenger route and any prospect of expanding Amtrak service elsewhere in New England.

Biden recently signed an executive order that commanded the Surface Transportation Board to put more pressure on railroads to stop their habitual practice of delaying Amtrak trains by making them wait for passing freight trains. That’s helpful. But the order failed to clarify what rights Amtrak possesses to expand service and what price it and other public entities must pay railroad owners for capital improvements. Because there’s no clear statutory authority some industry insiders predict that Amtrak’s legal fight to restore Gulf Coast passenger service will go all the way to the Supreme Court which could take years. State and local governments seeking to establish commuter rail service have even less legal leverage than Amtrak in negotiating terms with private railroad owners.

It’s much the same story when you consider the prospects for expanding freight rail service in the U.S. Don’t expect much progress unless we claw back Wall Street control.

There’s an overwhelming societal need to divert more freight from trucks to trains. Freight trains are three to five timesmore fuel efficient than trucks and produce far less emissions. Indeed when electrically powered by overhead wires trains can be emissions free and without the environmental and financial costs of battery disposal that plague electric trucks. According to one study a modest investment in electrifying freight railroads could reduce carbon emissions by 39 percent and by 2030 remove an estimated 83 percent of long-haul trucks from the road.

Moving more freight by rail would also reduce the number of Americans who are killed or injured by collisions with large trucks a casualty rate that reached 156000 in 2018. In addition it would reduce dramatically the damage done to America’s roads and highways by large trucks—each of which causes the same wear and tear as 9600 passenger cars.

Yet hedge funds private equity firms and other financiers are using their control of highly monopolized underregulated railroads not to expand rail freight but to sell off rail assets and hand over all but the highest-margin business to trucks.

Some of this downsizing is justified by the decline of the railroads’ thermal coal business as electric utilities convert to natural gas. But most of the downsizing results simply from financiers forcing railroads to shed all but their most lucrative lines of business. Such practices threaten to shrink the nation’s rail network to the point of nonviability but so long as rail expenses fall faster than rail revenues the short-term return on assets increases. That’s all Wall Street cares about.

The scale of the downsizing is dramatic. One measure is the rapid disappearance of boxcars. During the 10 years leading up to 2019 even as GDP increased by nearly 50 percent the railroad boxcar fleet shrank by one-third. Between 2000 and 2019 the trade journalist Bill Stephens reported the equivalent of 16132 merchandise freight trains each with 75 cars vanished from the tracks of CSX and Norfolk Southern. The main driver of this decline was an industry trend known as “demarketing” in which railroads actively turn away profitable but low-margin business—for example hauling grain or consumer appliances—if the move doesn’t involve huge volumes or requires boxcars to be hauled back empty. As a consequence many farmers now have to use expensive trucks to get their crops to market while many kinds of manufacturing become far more difficult if not impossible in the rapidly expanding number of towns and cities where the railroads will no longer do business.

Railroads are also making it more expensive and cumbersome for shippers to realize any advantage from combining shipment by truck with shipment by rail. Especially for trips over about 500 miles moving containers by both truck and train is much more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly than using trucks for the entire journey. During the 1980s and ’90s railroads won substantial market share back from trucks in some lanes by offering such intermodal service. But that was before Wall Street started demanding that railroads limit themselves to the highest-margin business.

Bowing to such pressure in 2018 Union Pacific and CSX discontinued their partnered service on 197 of 301 cross-country container train routes. As a consequence even shippers who still use railroads to ship containers wind up making much greater use of trucks. For example if a shipper wants to move a container from any number of western cities to Baltimore using Union Pacific and CSX CSX will no longer move the container the full distance. Rather CSX will only take it as far as Chambersburg Pennsylvania and then make the shipper hire a trucker to haul it the remaining 100 miles to Baltimore.

Railroads have also been stripping out terminal capacity. Wonder why it took so long to get that new car you ordered? The shortage of rail terminal space is a major reason for the widespread logistical bottlenecks since the economy began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July Union Pacific suspended container freight service from West Coast ports to Chicago for a week because it lacked the capacity to sort and redirect the boxes piling up there. The embargo immediately meant that still more boxes coming from Asia with everything from auto parts to transistors piled up on docks as West Coast ports waited for canceled trains. As the chain reaction continued the steamship line HMM warned customers to expect more delays and announced restrictions on loading containers bound for Chicago. The rail expert Larry Gross calculated that it would take 50 double-stack trains each carrying 800 20-foot containers to haul away the pileup caused by just one week of suspended rail service.

Why did this bottleneck occur? In large part because to appease Wall Street’s demands for higher margins Union Pacific had previously closed a major handling facility in Chicago known as Global III that it now desperately needed to keep the supply chain moving.

Wall Street has also pressured railroads into cutting expenses by reducing the frequency of freight service. If you live near railroad tracks or if you drive regularly over grade crossings you may have noticed that railroads run freight trains much less frequently nowadays and that the trains they do run can stretch as long as three miles. The industry refers to this as “PSR” or precision scheduled railroading. In practice PSR has nothing to do making trains run on precise schedules. The term was coined by the late E. Hunter Harrison a railroad executive who starting in the 1990s boosted railroad stock prices through radical downsizing. This made him the darling of hedge funds like Pershing Square Capital Management and Mantle Ridge.

PSR mostly just involves running fewer trains to fewer places using fewer employees while imposing all kinds of new fees on shippers. After Harrison implemented PSR at CSX Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific and other railroads imitated him and freight rail operations deteriorated nationwide. In 2019 Congress held hearings in which shippers relayed example after example of paying more for worse service. Since then CSX and other railroads have taken PSR still further by ripping out yards and laying off hard-to-replace employees such as locomotive mechanics and engineers. Between 2014 and 2019 before COVID had any impact the four largest railroads laid off 30000 mostly unionized workers.

The downsizing was so great that railroads can’t meet the post-pandemic surge of freight shipments. As a consequence still more freight will crowd onto the nation’s highways. “We can’t let hedge fund managers write the rules of railroading” complained Oregon Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio chairman of the House Transportation Committee in May as he called for an investigation into the way PSR has degraded railroad freight service.

Deregulation and a retreat from antitrust enforcement also feeds the financiers’ control over railroads. Since 1980 the number of major or Class I railroads has shrunk from 33 to seven—a number that will drop to six if a proposed merger between Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern wins regulatory approval. The result is that more shippers are served by only a single railroad. There are always trucks of course but some commodities (grain and chemicals for instance) are too heavy and bulky to move economically by truck for more than short distances.

Captive shippers once could depend on the Interstate Commerce Commission to protect them from predatory pricing but in 1980 the Carter administration and Congress stripped the government of almost all its practical ability to do so. The combination of deregulation and lax antitrust enforcement leaves railroads free to hike prices or degrade service standards.

The shippers’ loss has been the railroad stockholders’ gain. Less than three years after Mantle Ridge brought in Harrison to run CSX the railroad’s stock price doubled. Today its new CEO says he’s committed to growing the business—but that isn’t necessarily the railroad business. On his watch CSX bought a trucking company and used a $5 billion stock buyback program to raise the company’s stock price and fatten his own $15 million compensation package. The stock prices of other Class I railroads have also surged thanks to cost cutting that now allows railroads to spend less than 60 cents for every dollarthey take in as revenue.

This is the industry on which Congress and Biden propose to bestow $66 billion. To protect that investment we’ll need to do a lot more.

Government played an oversized role in building the nation’s railroads. Historically railroads operated under charters granted by state and local governments that required them to serve the public good. CSX’s tracks along the Gulf Coast for example were originally laid by a corporation created by an act of Alabama’s state legislature in 1866. The legislature gave this corporation government-like powers including eminent domain to acquire rights of way across the state. But in return the legislature stipulated that the line must be built and managed in a manner “best adapted to and for the public accommodation.”

This basic relationship between railroads and the public was codified into federal law in the late 19th century and lasted until the end of the 1970s. America’s early railroads received vast grants of public land and other direct subsidies that turned them into local or regional monopolies. In return American law treated them as quasi-public utilities subject to strict price regulation and the principle known as “common carriage” which prohibited them from turning away some customers or classes of business while favoring others.

As Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote for the majority in the 1898 case of Smyth v. Ames

A railroad is a public highway and nonetheless so because constructed and maintained through the agency of a corporation deriving its existence and powers from the state. Such a corporation was created for public purposes. It performs a function of the state. Its authority to exercise the right of eminent domain and to charge tolls was given primarily for the benefit of the public.

This led to railroads being heavily regulated first by state railroad commissions and then after 1887 by the Interstate Commerce Commission the first federal regulatory agency. The ICC came to wield enormous influence over industrial development by barring railroads from favoring one shipper industry city or region over another. The agency also compelled railroads to provide certain low-margin or even money-losing lines of business such as branch lines necessary to connect smaller cities and villages to the political and economic life of the nation. By controlling rates and terms of service the ICC also prevented price wars and other ruinous competition among railroads and gave them a legal vehicle to coordinate operating plans so freight and passengers could travel efficiently across more than one railroad.

Because of the ICC and the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 railroads in that era were subject to far more regulation and antitrust enforcement than railroads face today. That’s one big reason why late-19th- and early-20th-century rail tycoons like James Hill or E. H. Harriman concentrated on building and improving railroads rather than on predatory pricing and demarketing like today’s financiers.

This regulatory regime worked reasonably well until the mid-20th century. As the political scientist Samuel Huntingtonwould write in 1952 “During its sixty-five years of existence the Commission developed an enviable reputation for honesty impartiality and expertness.” But then it began falling apart. As advancing technology expanded transportation by automobile truck and air policy makers should have adjusted transportation policy to take advantage of potential synergies. They could have encouraged for example combining trains and trucks to move long-haul freight or trains and planes to reach out-of-the-way places. Instead funding was lavished on highway and airport construction.

A telling symbol of this imbalance is Washington’s monumental Union Station built by a consortium of railroads in the beginning of the 20th century. By the early 1960s the railroads were paying property taxes on the station of $350000 a year and an annual maintenance bill of more than $1 million even as they lost money on passenger train service mandated by the ICC. Meanwhile across the Potomac airlines availed themselves of the federally owned and operated National Airport—built expanded and operated by a tangle of federal agencies that included the Civil Aeronautics Board the Army Corps of Engineers and even the National Park Service.

This imbalance led to massive railroad bankruptcies in the 1970s. Washington at that point might have nationalized the railroads as nearly every other industrialized nation had done long before. Instead it bailed out railroad stockholders by allowing railroads to shed public responsibilities such as operating passenger trains and branch lines while allowing them to engage in a mad merger frenzy.

The strategy saved much of the industry from insolvency but at a tremendous cost to the public good. Since 1980 the nation has lost more than 40 percent of its rail mileage as many lines were ripped out that would be invaluable today as we struggle to decarbonize the economy and rationalize our transportation system. And once financiers twigged that Congress had turned railroads into unregulated monopolies answerable only to shareholders they swooped in and pressured rail management to adopt policies like PSR to further downsize and squeeze out the last drops of monopoly profit.

One solution to this mess would be to nationalize the railroads. The U.S. actually did this temporarily during World War I with many impressive results. Or we could nationalize only rail infrastructure leaving private companies to operate trains. This “open access” approach has shown promising results in Europe and it’s not all that different from how the Interstate Highway System works.

Alternatively we could take a “back to the future” approach once again treating railroads as utilities but paying better attention this time to coordinating regulation and subsidies among all transportation modes including new ones like drones and self-driving cars.

The one thing we shouldn’t do however if we want to preserve planet Earth and build back a transportation network that suits our needs is give the railroad industry more money without demanding that it serve the public interest. The looting has gone on long enough.

New data from labor-market analytics firm EMSI Burning Glass and the Conference Board a private research group suggest that 1.4 million jobs will open to people without college degrees in the next five years if employers continue to lower educational requirements at the current rate. In January 2019 42% of employment ads for insurance sales agents called for a bachelor’s degree the data show. In September 2021 26% did.

Darden Restaurants Inc. the parent of Olive Garden rolled out a new tool this year to allow people to apply for a job and schedule an interview at its restaurants within five minutes.

Waste Management Inc. this year retooled job applications for truck drivers and others that takes three minutes to fill out instead of as long as an hour. The goal is to prevent potential hires from walking away.

Southwest Airlines Co. is making some on-the-spot offers for ramp workers and other positions. Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on a call with analysts last month that the company had turned to new hiring techniques. Southwest aims to hire 5300 people this fall and 8000 next year.

A two-week hiring process for seasonal UPS workers now takes less than 30 minutes in certain cases. For some jobs such as driver helper there is no interview at all. Applicants answer online questions and can get a conditional job offer in as little as 10 minutes.

UPS eliminated job-application questions and hiring steps unless they were required for payroll purposes and government audits said Matt Lavery the company’s global director of sourcing and recruiting.

“In the market that we’re in if you don’t make a job offer to someone somewhat quickly someone else will” Mr. Lavery said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50d2luY2l0aWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzA3L2J1c2luZXNzLXBlb3BsZS11LXMtbmF2eS12ZXRlcmFuLWRyLWFsdGEtZGVyb28tbmFtZWQtY2hpZWYtbWVkaWNhbC1vZmZpY2VyLWF0LWhhemVsZGVuLWJldHR5LWZvcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business People: U.S Navy veteran Dr. Alta DeRoo named chief medical officer at Hazelden Betty Ford,"To place an obituary please include the information from the obituary checklist below in an email to obits@pioneerpress.com.

The conviction stems from an October 2020 incident; the trial was moved to Verona since she is an elected official in Belleville and lasted about four hours in late October.

Perjurious testimony

Jacho in an unusual move took the stand in her own defense — and in doing so quickly perjured herself by proffering false information about how this newspaper covered her 2020 arrest. Jacho testified under oath under the punishment of perjury The Observer within six hours of her arrest had her story on its front page.

Not possible.

https://www.theobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacho-observer.m4a Above: Audio of Jacho’s perjured testimony

Jacho was arrested Oct. 21 2020 — a Wednesday.

That edition of this once-a-week newspaper went to print/bed Monday Oct. 19 2020.

In reality The Observer published the story of her arrest on the front page of the Nov. 4 2020 edition two weeks — 336 hours not six hours — after she was arrested. She also lied on the stand by claiming under oath The Observer published a YouTube video of her arrest the same day she was arrested.

And while The Observer did indeed publish said video it was not until Wednesday Oct. 28 2020 — about 168 hours after she was arrested.

Her testimony also revealed she’s not particularly in tune with the newspapers that cover her township.

“I mean The Observer is not even my county” Jacho said of The Observer that has covered Belleville for more than 40 years.

It is not clear whether the prosecutor or judge are aware of Jacho’s perjury.

Meanwhile when she initially took the stand Jacho claimed she was barred by police from removing her high heels — and thus was unable to properly perform field-sobriety tests the police ordered facts disputed by testifying officers.

“I could not do it” she said.

She told the court she did not refuse to take the tests despite contrary testimony from several police officer. A few officers from Belleville and one an off-duty Kearny officer who had been inside the pub Michael’s Roscommon House 531 Joralemon St. in front of which the arrest took place were at the scene.

In attempt to explain her alleged “drunkenness” Jacho told a story about overusing hand sanitizer. That day she said she was going round town to deliver campaign signs. And after each interaction she would rub alcohol-based sanitizer on her hands since in October 2020 we were in the midst of the height of the pandemic.

Since she was putting her mask on and off that’s why there was an odor of alcohol surrounding her — not because she’d been drinking she claimed.

She also told a story about how she received alarming news from her son that he was dropping out of college in favor or working full-time at United Parcel Service not too long before she pulled the car over. She said the news from her son led her to park her vehicle because she was having a “panic attack” and was having difficulty breathing.

When police got to her car which was parked in front of a hydrant and sticking out into the street they were arriving to the results of said panic attack and subsequent pullover — not to a drunken driver she said.

Throughout the trial the public defender attempted to assert Jacho’s arrest was politically motivated something neither the judge nor the prosecutor bought. One way she tried to assert the conspiracy against her was to claim because there was an off-duty Kearny cop on-scene and the story appeared in The Observer it had to be a conspiracy.

Nothing of the sort ever happened. But the great concoction appears to stem from Jacho also not realizing The Observer has covered Belleville for more decades.

Clearly nonetheless the judge didn’t buy any of this testimony — and he was in fact fairly amazed Jacho didn’t face additional charges for resisting arrest etc.

“You are under oath ma’am … In order to respond to your objection (to dismiss — denied) there has to be some credible evidence. I mean there’s no assault charge in this case. We saw the video. We saw the video. I am shocked that there is not a criminal charge in this matter and I am shocked that those Belleville police officers stood outside that vehicle and had that soliloquy with your client. It shocks the conscience of the court they were so patient” Judge John A. Paparazzo the sitting Verona Municipal Court judge who heard the case said in the middle of Jacho’s testimony.

Jacho also claimed she was never asked to take an Alcotest in police headquarters and that she never claimed she didn’t speak English. That was an issue during her arrest where she could be heard on video saying she didn’t understand instructions police were giving to her in English.

Jacho speaks fluent English.

She said she ingested no alcoholic beverages or prescription medication the day she was arrested. Instead she said she learned on Oct. 22 she tested positive for COVID-19. It’s not clear whether that information was being used in her defense.

As soon as direct examination ended and Prosecutor Brian Mason offered his first inquiry on cross examination Jacho appeared to forget she was on a witness stand and had to answer his questions. Mason asked her what her highest level of education was — and Jacho took exception to it.

Paparazzo reminded Jacho) she must answer the question as he did before warning her this could happen by taking the stand — and though she eventually did answer she tried to weasel her way out of it.

Paparazzo also told Jacho if she didn’t answer she’d be held in contempt something he’d much prefer not to have to do.

She eventually answered by noting she had a bachelor’s degree from Seton Hall University.

Apparently her political detractors have often questioned whether she has such a degree.

Further on in cross Jacho claimed she was a political target because one police officer told her “he had to do his job just like she had to do her job.”

That line she said was enough to prove her arrest was politically motivated.

“If he didn’t know me how did he know I had a job and was a teacher?” she barked back.

The judge’s verdict

Paparazzo in rendering his verdict said he found all of prosecution’s witnesses — all of the officers involved in the arrest including the off-duty Kearny cop — to be credible. The witnesses he said “were consistent” and didn’t change their stories.

He also said the video of the arrest told the story and facts of what happened back in 2020 valuably. It proved her defense was invalid he said. It also proved he said the police officers who were sent to the scene acted professionally and properly.

“She was a person who was extremely intoxicated and that was clear from the video” Paparazzo said. “I find her credibility to be totally incredible. I find her statements that there is a concerted effort to target her … there is not one iota of evidence in this case to indicate that she was targeted.

“…She was not going to do anything (they said) that day. If they told her to go home I don’t think she would have left. She was not going to listen to anybody.”

Jacho was “uncooperative from the get-go” Paparazzo said. “She would not open the door she would not get out.”

Paparazzo also said that even if there wasn’t a single piece of testimony from the officers on the scene the video of the arrest alone was enough to prove her guilt.

“It is so obvious to a third party a judge or anyone who looked at that video they’d say this person is either highly intoxicated or is mentally ill” Paparazzo said. “It’s that bad. “This video should be used to train new recruits as to how police officers should just back off if you get into a situation.”

Paparazzo also concluded officers clearly smelled alcohol — and not hand sanitizer — on her breath.

In all she was found guilty of drunken driving refusal to submit to an Alcotest and failure to exhibit her documents (driver’s license registration and insurance.) Failure to exhibit carries a $157 fine and $30 court costs. Drunken driving carries a $407 fine and $33 court costs. A $225 DWI surcharge was also assessed as was a $50 violent-crimes fee. Her driver’s license was suspended indefinitely until she can prove she installed an ignition-interlocking device on her vehicle which must remain in place for 15 months.

The refusal carries a $507 fine and $33 court costs and an additional $100 surcharge.

Less than a year in administration leaders have rescinded previous antitrust guidelines sometimes without explicit replacement and stopped pending mergers dead in their tracks. It is difficult to cast judgment on so broad a policy shift but in at least one recent case antitrust’s new powerful backers seem to be fighting on the side of common sense.

The case in question involves the $13 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare by Optum the fast-growing subsidiary of the healthcare and insurance monolith UnitedHealth Group. According to Citi Change provides bill and payment processing services to more than 2000 payers and 1 million providers making it the biggest independent provider of health IT services for insurance reimbursement and revenue cycle management.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) threw up a roadblock in March concerned about the potential anticompetitive nature of the merger and put in a data request which the parties have just complied with agreeing to a 120-day delay. For the parties involved the rationale for the combination is clear: Change’s data and analytics platform will bolster Optum’s own data analytics capabilities solidifying Optum’s dominance in that arena. The combined entity would be able to better serve providers and payers by enabling them to integrate key processes giving Optum a clear advantage in revenue cycle and payment management services over existing competition.

The companies say that Change brings to the table “key technologies connections and advanced clinical decision administrative and financial support capabilities” while Optum offers complementary “modern analytics comprehensive clinical expertise innovative technologies and extensive experience in improving operational and clinical performance.” The result of the combination in theory would result in “better health outcomes and experiences for everyone at lower cost.”

Like the DOJ competitors state attorneys general and other industry onlookers are understandably not so thrilled. An association representing 21000 independent pharmacies claimed the deal would “create an unfair competitive advantage for a company that is already dominant.” The American Hospital Association noted earlier that the deal would give UnitedHealth Group a greater ability to favor its own UnitedHealthcare plans over those of competitors an inclination to raise prices on patients and the ability to use Change’s sensitive data sets to squeeze competitors.

To be clear: Change’s customers are both payers and providers. In the process of providing billing and payment management services Change sees the rates that competing payers pay provider organizations and the premiums they charge to clients. That data and the software platforms that Change has developed would give UnitedHealthcare an upper hand over competing payers in negotiations with provider organizations and in competitive pricing for group and individual insurance policies.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Despite outward signs of cooperation if the DOJ brings a lawsuit to block the merger which wouldn’t surprise me they will be able to build a strong case against the new anticompetitive entity. This is after all the largest payer in the U.S. seeking to acquire the largest provider of billing and payment management services U.S. Far from reducing costs for consumers it’s hard to imagine that a reduction in competition for health IT and revenue cycle management services combined with increased leverage for UnitedHealthcare in contract negotiations with hospitals would do anything but cost consumers more money.

“The massive divestiture provision to which the parties have agreed” the AHA’s general counsel added “does not provide the pathway needed to remedy the transaction’s likely substantial illegalities; rather it strongly indicates that the deal cannot be ‘fixed.'”

Despite both parties saying they have “certified substantial compliance” with the DOJ the case against this merger is still strong enough to require serious consideration and maybe even an injunction. In a tightening antitrust environment Optum will probably need to settle for smaller acquisitions while growing any additional capabilities it wants organically.

Gavi’s 5.0 vision of leaving no one behind with immunisation by 2030 is inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and aligned to Immunisation Agenda 2030 (IA2030). Equity is the organising principle of the Gavi 2021-25 (Gavi 5.0) strategy and underpins the broader “leave no one behind” ambition of the global development agenda. The Immunisation Agenda (IA 2030) places priority and focus on reaching the most marginalised and vulnerable populations to ensure that all children receive all vaccines. Routine immunisation programmes especially in low- and middle-income countries strengthen access to and delivery of primary health care (PHC) as a pathway towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Immunisation also contributes to global health security and achieving 14 of 17 SDGs. Gavi 5.0 Strategy: “Leaving no-one behind with immunization” by reaching zero-dose and missed communities The equity goal: Health systems sustainably reach all zero-dose and under-immunised children and their communities with the full range of vaccines as the first step towards providing integrated Primary Health Care (PHC) services. High quality immunisation services are sustainably available to missed communities where and when they are needed

All vaccines in the national schedule along the life course are available to missed communities

Caregivers bring children to vaccination services

Continuous improvements of programmes in range and quality of services These commitments follow decades of progress made by governments with support from the global health community and build on the achievements of the Alliance’s “Coverage & Equity” agenda in Gavi 4.0. In 2000 just 47% of children in lower-income countries received basic (DTP3) vaccines. In Gavi-eligible countries coverage of key vaccines increased by 3 percentage points from 2015 to 2019 and the number of zero dose children reduced by 14% (Figure 1). In 2019 coverage for the same countries reached 82% before sliding back to 78% due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Immunisation now reaches more communities than most other routine health interventions though we are still far from the goal of leaving no one behind with immunisation. Communities not receiving immunisation services are likely not receiving any other essential health services. In 2020 approximately 16 million of the 72.9 million children targeted with Gavi support did not receive their third dose of DTP-containing vaccine. 78% of these children 12.4 million in total did not receive a single dose of DTP-containing vaccines and are defined as “zero-dose.” Pre-pandemic analyses suggest nearly 50% of vaccine preventable deaths occur among zero-dose children. Two-thirds of these children live in extremely poor households suffering from multiple deprivations including lack of access to reproductive health services water and sanitation. Figure 1: Progress in reaching zero-dose and under-immunised children in Gavi implementing countries (Gavi57 country data). The most vulnerable populations have been hardest hit by the pandemic. Therefore Gavi’s mission to save lives by strengthening routine immunisation services and reaching zero dose children and missed communities has become even more urgent along with supporting countries to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 related disruptions led to a 4 percentage point drop in coverage in 2020. The estimated decline in DTP3 coverage was almost entirely due to a nearly 30% increase in zero-dose children highlighting the importance of reaching children with a first dose of vaccine. After a successful reduction of 1.7 million zero-dose children over the previous four years 2020 saw an increase of 3.1 million zero-dose children and 3.0 million underimmunised children in Gavi68 countries compared to 2019. Available data suggests the largest disruptions were concentrated in Q2 2020 with the majority of countries restoring routine immunisation services in the second half of the year. Over three-quarters of under-immunised children are now zero dose heightening the risk of child deaths disease outbreaks and medical impoverishment. Improvements in routine immunisation coverage has contributed to a large reduction in child deaths and recent analysis of immunization coverage trends show the importance of centering approaches on equity and underserved communities in order to avoid a further plateau of coverage in the coming decade. It can also be the first step towards comprehensive primary healthcare – providing opportunities for multi-agency and cross-sector coalitions to drive broader social change including gender equality. This ambition reflects the central shift in the Gavi 5.0 strategy of reaching zero-dose children and missed communities with a full course of vaccines in conjunction with stronger PHC services and an increased focus on programmatic sustainability. Once children receive one dose of a vaccine most children go on to receive more vaccines. A recent study found that over two-thirds of children reached with at least one dose of a vaccine went on to become fully vaccinated with all four basic vaccines (BCG Polio DTP and MCV). Figure 2: Two-thirds of children reached with at least one dose of a vaccine go on to become fully vaccinated The importance of immunisation reaching all children is paramount and ensures all children to have an equal chance of being healthy and productive members of society. Vaccination because of its preventative nature averts illness and provides particularly significant benefits to zero-dose communities which may lack access to affordable quality curative care while being at higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. Immunised children are also more likely to grow up healthy and to enjoy their right to survival and development. Vaccinated children have higher cognitive abilities miss school less and are in school for longer and have better nutrition and education outcomes – all of which translates into better earning potential and productivity as an adult.

Who are zero-dose children and missed communities?

Missed communities are often deprived of other basic services and face other socio-economic and gender disparities. The lack of access to immunisation is closely linked to extreme poverty: nearly two-thirds of zero-dose children in Gavi-supported countries live in households surviving on less than US$ 1.90 per day – the international poverty line. Zero-dose children live in communities that suffer not just from high child mortality but also high maternal deaths. Mothers of children who miss out on basic vaccines are 47% less likely to receive antenatal care or skilled birth attendance. The Global Action Plan for Health Lives and Wellbeing for All - Progress Report recognizes zero-dose child as a marker of communities facing multiple deprivations. With low immunisation coverage these communities are vulnerable to recurrent vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks such as measles which can spread rapidly worsening health and development outcomes. One in eight children in Gavi-supported countries are zero-dose yet these children account for nearly half of all children dying from vaccine preventable diseases. Communities with zero-dose children also have a significant number of under-immunised children: data shows a high degree of overlap between subnational areas with high numbers of zero-dose and high numbers of under-immunised children. The underlying causes for a child to be zero-dose are wide-ranging and include socio-economic factors deeply entrenched barriers and vulnerabilities related to poverty conflict forced migration homelessness and religious or cultural marginalisation. There may be systemic gaps in delivering reliable primary healthcare services or in addressing vaccine hesitancy. Gender barriers to immunisation continue to be varied including mothers’ access to education household decision-making for healthcare gender-based violence child marriages and teenage pregnancies. Gavi’s Gender Policy aims to address these barriers through research investment and partnerships. Communities that face these barriers exist in many geographic settings. Approximately 45% of the 9.7 million zero-dose children live in urban/peri-urban remote rural or conflict settings while the remaining are in non-specific settings. The contextual challenges of these settings have been studied by the wider immunisation community including by the Equity Reference Group. Geographic contexts with high concentrations of zero-dose children Informal and peri-urban settlements are characterised by high population density high mobility and an uneven distribution of wealth and services. There is a high risk of disease transmission and outbreaks in large growing densely populated areas with mobile and transient populations. Residents of remote-rural areas face barriers including service access weaker infrastructure economic deprivation and limited access to high quality health services. Approximately 1/5 of zero-dose children in Gavi-supported countries live in conflict settings/ areas. Conflict destabilises countries disrupting essential infrastructure and resources needed to provide care and access to services. Source: WorldPop analysis of IHME subnational immunization coverage estimates This means that successfully reaching zero-dose and under-immunised communities will require highly differentiated targeted sub-national strategies and a strong learning agenda. Learnings from Gavi’s 4.0 agenda show a varied but often increased cost in reaching these communities with tailored services. As part of realising the vision of Gavi 5.0 Gavi will advocate to identify and reach zero-dose and under immunized children and provide targeted funding and technical assistance to accelerate further progress.

Investing to reach the zero-dose and missed communities

Reaching zero-dose and under-immunised children means reaching the missed communities they are part of and building the link to the healthcare system and essential services. Significant investments must be made to reach children with immunisation across complex low-coverage and difficult settings and build a recurring touchpoint with the health system. The investments in Gavi-supported countries aim to make progress towards the Immunisation Agenda 2030 goal of reducing the number of zero-dose children by 50% by 2030. Since 2001 Gavi has provided a breadth of support to eligible countries including support for health systems strengthening vaccine introduction grants technical assistance operational costs in campaigns cold chain support and private sector partnerships and innovations. All these streams of support offer a lever to achieve the vision of leaving no one behind and are in support of countries’ National Immunisation Plans and health sector strategies (Refer to Annex B). In addition to traditional support the Equity Accelerator Fund (EAF) - a new dedicated fund for accelerating the 5.0 equity agenda and investments in zero-dose communities - is now available for interventions aimed at reaching the most at-risk communities. Figure 3: Overview of EAF Funding Mechanism Part of the EAF will be allocated to a new multi-country initiative to reach zero-dose children and missed communities in fragile conflict and cross-border settings outside government reach with a new partnership approach. The geographic focus of this support will be to the Sahel region and Horn of Africa due to the high number of zero-dose children residing in these regions because of prolonged humanitarian crisis conflict and displacement.

The year was 1989 and the idea from that chairman former Senator David Pryor of Arkansas touched off a drive for government drug-price negotiations that has been embraced by two generations of Democrats and one Republican president Donald J. Trump — but now appears at risk of being left out of a sprawling domestic policy bill taking shape in Congress.

Senior Democrats insist that they have not given up the push to grant Medicare broad powers to negotiate lower drug prices as part of a once-ambitious climate change and social safety net bill that is slowly shrinking in scope. They know that the loss of the provision promoted by President Biden on the campaign trail and in the White House could be a particularly embarrassing defeat for the package since it has been central to Democratic congressional campaigns for nearly three decades.

Ms McDonald said the conversation about a united Ireland should start with the health services in both jurisdictions which are subjects of review – the Bengoa process in the North and Sláintecare in the Republic.

She said any conversation about an Irish NHS cannot be achieved without “political seriousness” and a willingness to “knuckle down” and create an integrated health service.

Health is the issue that is raised the most when it comes to discussions about a united Ireland “beyond flags and emblems” she told the Ireland’s Future conference in the Mansion House Dublin.

“The smart money would join those together and create a single-tier universal health service for people across the island” she added.

Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond said the Republic’s health service scores well internationally and that it ought to be possible to combine the best from both health systems.

He said any all-Ireland health service should be free at the point of entry as a matter of principle but there could still be room for access to private health care.

Mr Richmond said “now is the time” to talk about a united Ireland because “Brexit has changed everything ... we are going to be voting on this in a Border poll a lot sooner than we think.”

Mr Richmond added that being in favour of a united Ireland should not be an “incendiary opinion” and should never be seen as offensive to unionists.

Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan said it ought it to be recognised that Sláintecare is not “a million miles away” from the NHS.

He suggested health economists should prepare a paper to state what a health service for a united Ireland would look like.

“Politicians are not going to be able to identify that now. That is why the work will have to be done in health or the economy. A huge amount of work will have to be done” he said.

He described the pursuit of Irish unification as a “perfectly legitimate political objective” and there is nothing “sinister or subversive about it”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uLmFmcmljYS9rZW55YS9jb3VudGllcy9uYWlyb2JpL2NvdXJ0LWFsbG93cy1ubXMtdG8tZXZpY3QtbWl0dW1iYS10cmFkZXJzLWZyb20tZ2lrb21iYS1tYXJrZXQtMzYxMDQ0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Court allows NMS to evict mitumba traders from Gikomba market,"The Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) has received court's nod to evict a section of traders dealing with secondhand clothes within Gikomba open air market to pave way for expansion of the neighbouring Pumwani Majengo Health Centre.

Justice Oguttu Mboya said granting the traders' request for an order to stop the looming eviction and demolition of business structures would militate against the public good.

He said the injunction would otherwise forestall the realisation of the right to universal health care premised on the intended upgrade of the health Centre.

The judge noted that the traders' right to earn a living must not constitute a fetter to the NMS' rights to expand and upgrade the Health Center into Level Three Hospital.

The 174 traders operating at Gacucu Gikomba open air market wanted court to stop NMS from threatening or interfering with their occupation of the land pending hearing of their case.

Led by Mr Francis Kimathi Mutisya they informed the court that they have conducted the said business in the said market for over 40 years.

Business premises

He contended that the imminent demolition of their business premises would affect and destroy their lives and source of livelihoods.

But NMS opposed the case saying the market sits on public land and that the same ought to be used as such and for purposes of enhancing the public good.

Mr Stephen Mwangi the Deputy Director in Charge of lands in the NMS stated that the area in question covers and falls within the hospital and the area is necessary for purposes of the expansion of the said medical facility to accommodate the increased demand for health care.

He said the traders have since encroached onto and occupied a substantial chunk of the suit property.

As a result of the encroachment they have not only blocked access to the health facility but also the sewerage system that serves the hospital.

""As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a growing need for medical services and hence there has arisen the necessity to upgrade the medical facility to Level Three Hospital. Consequently the expansion is extremely necessary and so the recovery of vacant possession of the suite property is needed to facilitate the upgrade"" Mr Mwangi stated.

Public land

In its ruling the court said although the traders have a right to earn a living the right to do so does not confer upon them any entitlement to the public land in question.

""Whereas I affirm their rights to earn a living and livelihood it must however be noted that the petitioner's rights to do so are not absolute. In this regard it suffices to observe that the right to earn a living and carry on business is one which is subject to the Limitation under Article 25 of the Constitution"" said Justice Mboya.

He added that although the government is entitled to recover vacant possession for purposes of putting the same to the designated public use it is nevertheless obliged to issue and serve the traders with the requisite notices.

On traders' request that they will suffer irreparable loss the court noted that being an open-air market there are no Permanent structures and buildings that are erected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1a28uY28ua2Uva2VueWEvNDMyNTQ0LWdpa29tYmEtZXZpY3Rpb25zLWNvdXJ0LWFsbG93cy1ubXMtcmVtb3ZlLXNvbWUtdHJhZGVycy1jcmVhdGUtc3BhY2UtaG9zcGl0YWwtZXhwYW5zaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gikomba Evictions: Court Allows NMS to Remove Some Traders Create Space for Hospital Expansion - Tuko.co.ke,"The eviction is aimed at paving way for the expansion of the Pumwani Majengo Health Centre which neighbours the market

The traders led by Francis Kimathi as reported by Nation told the court that they had occupied the piece of land in the said market for over 40 years.

However NMS opposed the petition saying the market sits on public land which ought to be used for purposes of heightening the public good.

In his ruling Justice Oguttu Mboya said granting the traders' request to stop evictions would be against the public good.

He said the order would derail the fulfilment of the Universal Health Care which he said is premised in the intended expansion of the hospital.

Mboya argued that the traders' right to earn a living should not be an inconvenience to NMS's right to expand the health facility into a Level Three Hospital.

The judge asked NMS to serve the traders with requisite notices before evicting them.

In other news thousands of Kiambu residents and developers who were occupying a 120-acre piece of land owned by Kenyatta University are on the verge of being evicted.

This is after a court nullified the title deeds they were offered 21 years ago under a directive of the then-president the late Daniel arap Moi.

After 19 years of court battles Justice Loice Komingoi gave a green light to the learning institution to repossess its land which is located in Kamae Kahawa.

Komingoi declared the occupants including developers who bought plots on the disputed land and put up commercial buildings as trespassers.

El periodista Raúl Menchaca comenzó su entrevista con una pregunta que afecta de manera sensible a todos los cubanos.

¿Qué podemos hacer para resolver el problema de la carencia de la oferta en moneda nacional en nuestras tiendas en Cuba? ¿Qué está pasando? consultó.

El titular de Economía en la isla manifestó al medio que “están pasando varias cosas. Lo primero es que el país ha tenido una restricción fuerte de la liquidez por la afectaciones de los ingresos en divisa”.

En este sentido habló en primer lugar del “recrudecimiento del bloqueo que ha impedido el ingreso de divisas al país por varias vías incluida la de las remesas”.

“Esa fuente de ingreso importante para la isla” añade Gil. El segundo elemento al que se refirió fue a la crisis sanitaria “que nos paralizó el turismo entonces es claro que disponemos de menos recursos financieros para poder mantener un nivel estable de ofertas”.

Es en este contexto que el gobierno cubano introduce las llamadas tiendas MLC tan criticadas por la población como la Tarea Ordenamiento.

“Las tiendas en MLC son una alternativa en esa coyuntura para poder al menos captar una cantidad de divisa que estaban saliendo del país a través de la importación de personas naturales” dijo el Ministro.

Según el dirigente “eso nos permite al menos tener un nivel de ofertas no con la estabilidad que queríamos pero por lo menos un nivel de oferta mínimo en las condiciones actuales y redireccionar esos recursos para poder crear ofertas en pesos cubanos”.

De esta manera Gil Fernández señala que “lo primero que tienes que hacer con los ingresos que se captan por las tiendas MLC es reaprovisionar esos mercados en MLC si no lo pierdas en un periodo corto de tiempo”.

Aquí aseguro que “se toma un pequeño nivel de ese dinero para mantener las ofertas en moneda nacional”.

Según el Ministro de Economía “este año se han utilizado 300 millones de dólares de lo que se ha recaudado por las ventas en tiendas MLC para respaldar ofertas que se venden en pesos cubanos”.

Estas declaraciones ciertamente no van en sintonía con la de la mayoría de los cubanos que reclama constantemente ya no por la inestabilidad sino por la ausencia de productos en pesos cubanos.

Expresó Gil que en el diseño de la medida de las tiendas MLC “debimos haber dedicado más recursos a las ofertas en pesos pero no ha sido posible convertir en dinero utilizable una parte importante del dinero que se ha recaudado en los sistemas bancarios”.

Hace referencia a los dólares americanos que los cubanos depositaron en efectivo en los bancos para transferirlo hacia las tarjetas MLC y que Cuba no puede usar en las transacciones.

“Parte de ese dinero era para reponer las ofertas en peso cubano” dice el gobernante cubano.

El Ministro cerró esta parte de su explicación indicando que “la causa principal es el déficit de ingresos”.

Además menciona que “iremos gradualmente recuperando las ventas en pesos cubanos” aunque reconoció que “la tarea más importante que tiene la economía ahora mismo en estos momentos es el control de la inflación”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWJhdGUuY29tLm14L2Vjb25vbWlhL1ByZXZlLU1jQWxsZW4tMzAtbWFzLXZlbnRhcy10cmFzLWxhLWFwZXJ0dXJhLWRlLWxhLWZyb250ZXJhLWVudHJlLVVTQS15LU1leGljby0tMjAyMTExMDctMDAyOS5odG1s0gGFAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlYmF0ZS5jb20ubXgvZWNvbm9taWEvUHJldmUtTWNBbGxlbi0zMC1tYXMtdmVudGFzLXRyYXMtbGEtYXBlcnR1cmEtZGUtbGEtZnJvbnRlcmEtZW50cmUtVVNBLXktTWV4aWNvLS0yMDIxMTEwNy0wMDI5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prevé McAllen 30% más ventas tras la apertura de la frontera entre USA y México,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.debate.com.mx/economia/Preve-McAllen-30-mas-ventas-tras-la-apertura-de-la-frontera-entre-USA-y-Mexico--20211107-0029.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWJhdGUuY29tLm14L2Vjb25vbWlhL1ByZXZlLU1jQWxsZW4tMzAtbWFzLXZlbnRhcy10cmFzLWxhLWFwZXJ0dXJhLWRlLWxhLWZyb250ZXJhLWVudHJlLVVTQS15LU1leGljby0tMjAyMTExMDctMDAyOS5odG1s0gGFAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlYmF0ZS5jb20ubXgvZWNvbm9taWEvUHJldmUtTWNBbGxlbi0zMC1tYXMtdmVudGFzLXRyYXMtbGEtYXBlcnR1cmEtZGUtbGEtZnJvbnRlcmEtZW50cmUtVVNBLXktTWV4aWNvLS0yMDIxMTEwNy0wMDI5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjb25vbWlzdGEuZXMvYWN0dWFsaWRhZC9ub3RpY2lhcy8xMTQ2NTI4OC8xMS8yMS9NaWVkby1hLXVuLXBvc2libGUtYXBhZ29uLVNlLWRpc3BhcmFuLWxhcy12ZW50YXMtZGUtY2FtcGluZy1nYXMtYm9tYm9uYXMtcGlsYXMteS1saW50ZXJuYXMuaHRtbNIBjgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjb25vbWlzdGEuZXMvYWN0dWFsaWRhZC9hbXAvMTE0NjUyODgvTWllZG8tYS11bi1wb3NpYmxlLWFwYWdvbi1TZS1kaXNwYXJhbi1sYXMtdmVudGFzLWRlLWNhbXBpbmctZ2FzLWJvbWJvbmFzLXBpbGFzLXktbGludGVybmFz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,¿Miedo a un posible apagón? Se disparan las ventas de camping gas bombonas pilas y linternas,"Parece que las palabras de la ministra de Transición Ecológica Teresa Ribera descartando un apagón eléctrico en España no han calado en parte de la población. Ante la posibilidad de que esto ocurra ya son muchos los que se están preparando adelantándose y comprando todo tipo de material de supervivencia ya sean linternas hornillos de gas bombonas de butano o pilas entre los productos más demandados.

En cambio otros muchos sí que se han tomado al pie de la letra las palabras de la ministra de Defensa austríaca Klaudia Tanner en las que aseguraba que ""la cuestión no es si habrá o no un gran apagón sino cuándo"". Estas declaraciones ya han provocado un pequeño tsunami en el sector de la ferretería en donde muchas de sus tiendas han agotado las existencias de camping gas y hornillos pequeños tal y como informan varios medios.

Para más inri desde Protección Civil ya hablan de una ""posibilidad real"" tal y como informó en RAC1 el subdirector de Programas de Protección Civil Sergio Delgado. Para ello este organismo de seguridad ha emitido listas de consejos y recomendaciones ante un posible apagón eléctrico. Según informan el stock de hornillos de gas se ha acabado prácticamente en toda Catalunya y los proveedores tampoco tienen más stock.

Entre estos consejos de emergencia se recomienda tener a mano una linterna velas un teléfono móvil con cargador mantas utensilios personales o un botiquín con primeros auxilios. También aconsejan tener preparadas reservas de comer en latas abrelatas barritas energéticas además de botellas de agua.

Decathlon es otra de las tiendas en donde se ha disparado la demanda de estos artículos. Tal y como recoge El Periódico de España en la única tienda donde esta semana tenían algunas unidades cuentan que se han agotado.

Seúl 6 de noviembre (Yonhap) -- Las grandes compañías de K-pop han presenciado un aumento drástico de sus ingresos en el extranjero en la primera mitad del año según mostraron esta semana datos financieros a medida que el número y la influencia de los fanes foráneos se han incrementado a tal grado que pueden determinar los ""rankings"" en los listados musicales locales.

Según los datos disponibles en el sistema electrónico de divulgación de información del Servicio de Supervisión Financiera (FSS según sus siglas en inglés) a fecha de el lunes Hybe que representa a BTS Seventeen y Enhypen registró ventas nacionales que constituyen solo el 2496 por ciento de los 456.900 millones de wones (390 millones de dólares) en sus ventas totales en el primer semestre del año.

América del Norte representó el 1983 por ciento de las ventas totales Asia el 1127 por ciento y otros países el 231 por ciento. Las ventas en línea donde es difícil detectar la ubicación del consumo tuvieron una participación del 4144 por ciento. Hybe dijo que se estima que una gran parte de las ventas en línea provienen de mercados extranjeros.

JYP Entertainment que representa a bandas populares como TWICE y Stray Kids también vio que sus ventas en el extranjero superaron a las nacionales en el primer semestre. Registró 72.900 millones de wones (62 millones de dólares) en ventas totales 39.500 millones de wones (335 millones de dólares) de los cuales procedieron de exportaciones y 33.300 millones de wones (28 millones de dólares) de ventas nacionales.

Con el rápido aumento de la popularidad del K-pop en el extranjero también están creciendo rápidamente los canales de distribución en línea cuyos clientes objetivo son fanes del K-pop en todo el mundo.

Ktown4u que vende álbumes y productos promocionales de K-pop no solo está disponible en coreano e inglés sino también en chino japonés tailandés e indonesio para los fanes extranjeros.

HM International el operador de tal canal presenció en 2020 una subida del 1334 por ciento interanual en sus ventas anuales hasta los 177.300 millones de wones (151 millones de dólares).

En este contexto la forma en que un álbum atrae activamente a los fanes foráneos se convirtió en la clave de su éxito. Dado que es difícil esperar un ""gran éxito"" solo con las ventas nacionales los grupos novatos que necesitan dar a conocer sus nombres están más dispuestos a conseguir fanes en el extranjero.

Un representante de una de las grandes agencias de K-pop dijo bajo la condición del anonimato que las ventas de álbumes de los grupos masculinos han aumentado mucho después del brote del nuevo coronavirus y es cierto que los fanes extranjeros tienen una participación significativa en las ventas de álbumes.

El representante de otra agencia también dijo que a medida que los grupos de K-pop tienen un buen desempeño en los mercados de EE. UU. y América del Sur las ventas de sus antiguos álbumes aparte de las de los nuevos están subiendo en números significativos.

Agregó que los fanes extranjeros también se involucran de manera organizada para apoyar a sus artistas favoritos.

Asimismo dijo que si se reanudan los conciertos presenciales que en su mayoría habían sido cancelados durante los dos últimos años debido al COVID-19 es probable que el mercado internacional reciba más atención.

No es exagerado decir que YouTube otro importante canal de consumo de K-pop depende en gran medida del éxito relacionado con los fanes del K-pop en el extranjero.

Según YouTube el grupo femenino de K-pop más popular BLACKPINK logró 9.150 millones de visualizaciones totales en YouTube el año pasado el 96 por ciento de las cuales procedieron del extranjero. El 4 por ciento restante o 361 millones de visualizaciones provino de Corea del Sur.

Por países Indonesia tuvo el mayor número de visualizaciones con 758 millones seguida por Tailandia con 736 millones la India con 679 millones Filipinas con 638 millones y México con 514 millones.

Las visualizaciones de YouTube también son muy importantes para las agencias porque se utilizan para calcular los ""rankings"" en los programas de televisión musicales de cada país.

Ante tal situación las agencias de K-pop ahora no solo se preocupan por los fanes locales sino también por las características culturales de varios países para evitar varias controversias innecesarias que involucran a sus artistas al darse cuenta de que algunos problemas pueden despertar el descontento de los fanes foráneos incluso si no representan un problema en Corea del Sur.

En el caso más reciente Giselle miembro del grupo femenino aespa tuvo que publicar una disculpa en Twitter después de cantar simplemente de forma informal ""Love Gallore"" de SZA durante su presencia en un sitio de filmación. Recibió fuertes protestas de los fanes extranjeros porque la letra incluye la palabra ""niggas"" que menosprecia a las personas de color.

El lunes pasado Giselle publicó en inglés en la cuenta de Twitter del grupo que le gustaría disculparse por pronunciar la palabra improcedente de la letra de la canción que se estaba reproduciendo en el sitio.

IZ*ONE un grupo de proyecto ahora disuelto eliminó un vídeo musical original en junio del año pasado cuando se señaló que las joyas que la miembro Kwon Eun-bi portó en el centro de su frente eran similares a un ""bindi"" que se usa en sentido religioso en la cultura hindú.

También el año pasado BLACKPINK generó controversia por usar la estatua del dios hindú Ganesha en el videoclip de ""How You Like That"". Terminó modificando la escena en respuesta a las protestas de los fanes indios.

Doyle W. Clifton

San Angelo - Doyle Clifton of Santa Fe TX passed away on November 1 2021 at the age of 88. He was born in Frost TX on January 30 1933. Doyle married the love of his life Virgie Kuykendall Clifton on February 9 1952. They were married for almost 70 years and were best friends.

Doyle attended the University of Houston and Angelo State University earning an Associate Technical Degree in 1985. He worked for GTE/Verizon for 39 years starting as a lineman and retiring as an Engineer in Planning. After retiring he worked as a realtor planted a pecan orchard and had a mowing business.

Doyle was a man of faith and served as a Mason since 1957 and a Deacon since 1960. He worked with Habitat for Humanity and built houses for Christmas in April. He was a member of First Baptist Church of San Angelo TX for many years and was a member of Arcadia First Baptist Church in Santa Fe TX before his passing.

In his spare time he loved spending time with his family. He was always there to support his kids and grandkids. He was a wonderful husband father and papa. Every year he would read the Christmas story to the family. He loved to sing and would make up songs. Doyle was a tenor member of a singing group that performed at ASU.

Doyle was known and loved by many. He was a fantastic friend and never met a stranger. Everyone who knew Doyle loved him. He was grateful for his many friendships. He was always looking for ways to help others. He couldn't go to anyone's house without finding something to fix. He stayed busy every second of his life. He will be deeply missed but leaves behind a great legacy of a beautiful life.

Doyle is survived by his wife Virgie Clifton and his daughter Sandra Clifton Held (Matt). Doyle is preceded in death by his son Tommy Wayne Clifton and his grandson Douglas Wayne Clifton. He is survived by his grandchildren Heather Huckaby Jennifer Pucel Tabitha Odom Amy Clifton Chad Clifton; he had nine great-grandchildren and four great-great-grand-children.

The beta version of Google Messages 10.4 reveals a new settings preference called ""Google Photos: Share sharper clarity video in text (SMS/MMS). The outlet was able to enable the feature to appear in the settings menu of the app.

Source: 9to5Google

Based on the description of this setting recipients may receive a Google Photos link to click and watch a video from the sender. The other possibility is that a recipient who receives a Google Photos link to the Messages app may be able to watch the high-quality video right from the chat window. We'd imagine that iOS users may need to open the link in a browser.

Cloud-sharing large files isn't a new concept. Samsung supports ""Link Sharing"" which uploads photos and videos to a Samsung server for recipients to download within a limited amount of time through a link that's accessed via any browser. A first-party solution from Google would be a swell idea as videos no longer deserve to be severely compressed and sent over an outdated protocol.

Sending an MMS video on Google Messages

This would certainly make Android users not look as bad when trying to send a video clip to an iOS user only for the recipient to see a garbled video and scoff at their friend for having the audacity to message them a video from an Android phone.

The largest blaze the Caldor Fire produced heavy smoke that substantially reduced air quality and induced highway closures that halted visitation from Northern California customers. Gaming operations which are normally crowded during the busy Labor Day weekend were shut down for six days.

South Lake Tahoe casino operators knew the shutdown was temporary. But they feared images of the blaze could fuel a misperception by customers that Northern Nevada’s picturesque gaming community was going up in flames.

In reality the Caldor Fire which consumed nearly 222000 acres over a two-month period never got closer than five miles from the city of South Lake Tahoe which neighbors the Nevada community of Stateline.

Hard Rock Lake Tahoe Executive Director of Marketing Eric Barbaro said national headlines and images circulated during the fire “sensationalized” the effect on the Tahoe region.

“The communication wasn't clear. You would have thought Tahoe had burned to the ground and the lake was going to have an environmental impact for years to come” Barbaro said in early October. “This has been a two-month ordeal for the market. We’re just getting back out of it.”

Karie Hall general manager of Harrah’s Lake Tahoe and Harveys Lake Tahoe said damage from the fire was non-existent in the populated areas of the community.

“We wanted to get that message to get out there that Tahoe is just as beautiful as it ever has been” Hall said. “There was some structure damage but the fire never got near the lake. It didn’t get near any of our properties. We were actually an evacuation site for a lot of folks.”

Beyond the temporary closures the fire compounded fears of a more rapid decline in the region’s gaming market which saw peak gaming revenue more than two decades ago amid the growth of tribal casinos in Northern California and lasting damage from the 2008 recession.

But nearly two months later the South Lake Tahoe gaming market appears to be rallying. Early snow falls during October gave hope for a busy winter ski season at the neighboring Heavenly Mountain Ski Resort and resort operators say hotel reservations through Christmas and the New Year have been picking up.

“The market is recovering guests are returning and we look forward to a great ski season” MontBleu Resort Casino General Manager Tim Tretton said. “The early snowfall and colder weather have created a great base for the ski resorts resulting in an early season and lift in room bookings.”

Doug Pierini chief operating officer of the Western Region for Vail Resorts (which owns Heavenly) said the ski area’s critical infrastructure was untouched.

“Thanks to the hard work and tremendous efforts of those on the ground both resorts’ winter downhill trails and features resort lodges equipment chairlifts and the Heavenly Tram and gondola all remain intact” Pierini said in an emailed statement in late September.

Tahoe casinos foresee a late 2022 opening for the long-planned $80 million Tahoe South Events Center. The 132000 square-foot facility is being constructed at the corner of the U.S. Highway 50 and Lake Parkway on land that was once a parking lot for MontBleu and will provide a location to host conferences sports tournaments and concerts with a capacity up to 6000 attendees.

“We first envisioned this in 2010 and we will be able to do so many different events” said Carol Chaplin CEO of the Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority.

South Lake Tahoe’s casino market is primarily made up of four casino resorts with three owners.

Hard Rock is owned by Las Vegas-based Paragon Gaming which licensed the name and brand from Hard Rock International. Harveys and Harrah’s are operated by Caesars Entertainment through a lease agreement with real estate investment trust VICI Properties.

MontBleu is expected to take on a new name later this month: Bally’s Lake Tahoe. The property’s operations were acquired earlier this year by Rhode Island-based Bally’s Corp. which is in the process of buying the operations of Tropicana Las Vegas.

The only other gaming entity in South Lake Tahoe is a Dotty’s slot machine parlor on Highway 50 near Harrah's.

Gaming revenues were soaring

The Labor Day shutdown came as the Tahoe market was on a rebound from 2020.

“Some people were having the best summer ever” Chaplin said.

The Gaming Control Board said the September revenue totals for South Lake Tahoe was $5.6 million a decline of 69 percent from pre-pandemic September 2019. Control Board analyst Michael Lawton said the figure represented the region’s lowest single-month revenue total in history — with the exception of April and May of last year when gaming operations were suspended statewide at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Extended road closures in California drove the recent revenue decline. U.S. Highway 50 the primary artery into South Lake Tahoe from the Bay Area and through Sacramento remained closed on the California side until Sept. 20. Highway 88 a road that helps connect Tahoe with Central California communities including Stockton was closed until Sept. 16.

Still South Lake Tahoe gaming revenue is up 13.3 percent for the first nine months of the year compared to 2019 when the market produced $225.6 million in gaming revenue. Before the September shutdown South Lake Tahoe was 22.9 percent ahead of 2019 revenue totals.

“This illustrates how strong gaming had been running up until the fire” Lawton said.

Calendar year 2000 was South Lake Tahoe’s highest-ever 12-month gaming revenue period at $352.6 million. But over time competition from Northern California tribal casinos and the 2008 recession took away visitation. South Lake Tahoe’s gaming totals through September are still down 28.1 percent from the 2000 record.

Over the last two decades South Lake Tahoe casino operators have upgraded facilities and have made a renewed commitment to the market.

“There are some great properties and fantastic assets up here” Hall said. Caesars recently completed roughly $40 million in renovations at Harveys including a remodeling of the hotel tower closest to the lake and adding restaurants such as Gordon Ramsey’s “Hell’s Kitchen.”

“There's more work to come it's not announced yet... they're primarily focused on the Harveys’ side but Harrah’s will get its love soon” Hall said.

During the COVID-19 shutdown South Lake Tahoe lost one gaming operator. The small Lakeside Casino Resort never reopened after the state’s 78-day shutdown was lifted. The ownership sold off the furnishings and interiors including the gaming equipment in an auction while the building and land were sold to Barton Health which will turn the facility into a medical center.

“They had plans to sell before COVID so it wasn't because of the pandemic” Chaplin said. “It was one of the times when it just didn’t make sense to keep going.”

A cooperative effort

After the fire danger subsided and South Lake Tahoe casinos reopened operators said a combined effort was needed to boost the gaming market’s prospects and assure visitors the region was open for business.

Similar cooperation took place before and after the casinos turned off their games between Sept. 1-6. The resorts served as temporary housing for firefighters and other first responders as well as for a number of California-based employees who were forced to evacuate.

The casino parking lots were transformed into command centers for the agencies fighting the Caldor Fire.

“Our biggest concern was the community” said Hall who grew up on the California side of Lake Tahoe before starting her career with Caesars. She has since managed several of the company’s casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and in Atlantic City.

She returned to Tahoe to oversee the two properties earlier this year.

“Obviously it's not always pleasant to close but we were happy to have become a host property to our firefighters and first responders” Hall said. “We really felt like the community stepped up. We’re all competitive and we all want to do well but really try and work together because that’s what is best for the entire region.”

Tretton agreed the South Lake Tahoe community “came together in a way that I have never seen before to support firefighters first responders and all law enforcement.”

Barbaro said Hard Rock’s back parking lot was filled with fire trucks from various local state and government agencies. But with the immediate fire danger out of the way the casino wanted to replace images of fire fighting with picturesque images of Lake Tahoe showing customers the area remained untouched.

Hard Rock sent photographers to those locations time-stamped and dated the photos and put them out in direct mail and email marketing pieces to the property’s database. The images were also distributed on Hard Rock’s social media channels.

“We showed them Tahoe was still in great condition beautiful and with no trees burnt in those areas” Barbaro said.

That cooperation efforts during and after the fire also included non-gaming businesses.

Jerry Bendel general manager of the Forest Suites Resort a 120-unit property on the California side tucked behind the Heavenly Village Shops and within walking distance of Harrah’s and Harveys jumped into action during the shutdown.

His onsite commercial laundry facility served firefighters staying at his property and the nearby casinos.

“We’re all in this together” Bendel said. Forest Suites guests often visit the casinos for dinners shows and gaming.

“A certain type of guests like to stay at the casinos and we get guests who prefer this type of setting” Bendel said. “There is plenty of business for everyone.”

The $80 million Tahoe South Events Center will provide a location to host conferences sports tournaments and concerts with a capacity up to 6000 attendees. The project seen on Oct. 11 2021 is expected to open in late 2022. (Tim Lenard/The Nevada Independent)

Events center will transform the market

Chaplin believes the business lost during the fire shutdown was temporary. Before the fire Lake Tahoe brought in several high-profile events.

The annual American Century Celebrity Golf Championship was held at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in July following a one-year hiatus due to COVID-19. The event was televised by NBC.

In February two National Hockey League outdoor games – Vegas Golden Knights versus Colorado Avalanche and Boston Bruins versus Philadelphia Flyers – were played on a specially constructed ice rink at the Edgewood 18th hole and were also televised by NBC.

Chaplin said the images televised nationally offered Tahoe a tremendous marketing opportunity.

Hall added that the appeal of Lake Tahoe to outdoor enthusiasts hasn’t changed.

“People here are coming for leisure and they really want to ski or they want to hike” Hall said adding that the casinos’ biggest competition is “nature.”

The game-changer Chaplin believes is the Tahoe South Events Center which will feature 4200 seats for sports or entertainment and 6000 seats for stage events.

Tretton said Bally’s Tahoe is designing a long-range capital plan in conjunction with the events center and Barbaro said the Hard Rock views the multi-use facility as a venue for conferences concerts and shows that will benefit the entire market.

“It’s an opportunity to bring some cool stuff here” Barbaro said. “It really opens up Tahoe to proving that it's a beautiful place to come visit and you could do anything you want here whether it's personal or business.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Chilean wrestler Katrina Cortez was one of the eighteen wrestlers released from WWE this past Thursday shortly after the promotion announced record profits at their third quarter earnings call. A day later another roadblock has been put in Cortez' path. On Twitter the 21 year old revealed that her visa expires in the next month complicating plans for her future wrestling in the United States.

""At 18 I made the decision to travel to an unknown country without knowing English I came here"" Cortez tweeted. ""Today I receive an email telling me that my visa expires next month and I will have to sell everything that with much love and effort I have achieved!!!""

Earlier Friday Cortez tweeted out her contact information for future bookings indicating she was unaware her visa was set to expire. The former WWE star has been active on social media since her release largely retweeting support from past colleagues and fans.

Visa issues have been a common problem for recent WWE releases. Both Cassie Lee and Jessica McKay of The IInspiration have talked about Green Card issues prevented them from working following their release from WWE in April. Former NXT North American Bronson Reed revealed earlier in the week that he was unable to compete at Impact's Bound For Glory due to similar issues.

A seven year veteran who began her career at 14 years old Cortez wrestled in her native Chile before signing with WWE in 2019. She quickly reached the main roster under the name Carolina teaming with the second Sin Cara to take on current AEW star Andrade and Zelina in a losing effort. Afterwards she was taken off TV and sent back to NXT where she would work as Catalina Garcia on the house show circuit before changing her name to Katrina Cortez in January. Her last match was on October 26 where she lost to Sarray on 205 Live.

Jason Moser: It's Monday November 1st. I am your host Jason Moser and on today's Financials Show we're digging into the latest earnings reports for Visa Mastercard and Robinhood. Joining me this week it's Jason Hall. Jason good to see you.

Jason Hall: Jason Moser it is a pleasure to be on with you.

Jason Moser: We don't get to do this often enough. I'm glad we have a plethora of material to get through. We could probably talk about this stuff for a lot more time than we were allowed to today. Let's just jump right in.

Jason Hall: Yeah we've got an hour's worth of content and 30 minutes to get it done.

Jason Moser: Easily we're in the middle of earnings season of course. A lot of companies reporting last week and this week. Last week we had a few of our favorites to cover reporting. We're going to start the show this week with Mastercard. Mastercard I think everybody is very familiar with the brand and with generally speaking what they do. Not the greatest week. They had a tough week last week shares down about six and a half percent. It felt like a good report that in fact the market received it with cautious optimism. What are your takeaways from Mastercard's recent report there?

Jason Hall: Yeah I think so too. Jason if you look at the stock chart to think about what's going on with the stock price versus what's happening out here in the actual world it feels like Mastercard and Visa the two we're going to talk about got tied up in that reopening trade. The result that we've seen over the year because that was the big talk at the beginning of the year and early in the winter. The results I guess just haven't met expectations. I think maybe I'm taking a look at Mastercard. You go back into the second quarter and it reports all of these different metrics or different parts of its business. In general we think about the e-commerce stuff so transactions card-not-present. That's largely people ordering stuff online has just exploded and that's driven their number of transactions above 2019 levels. That's another thing that we're doing that's helpful is they're not just giving us the comps to last year because we know last year was bizarre land and not representative of the kind of business that this normally is. We get those 2019 comps and I could look at switched volume you look at switched transactions 127 percent in the second quarter 131 percent in the third quarter and then through October 21st 132 percent. We're seeing that continued acceleration. But then you look at their international travel number that cross-border volume and it was still 77 percent of 2019 levels right?

Jason Moser: Yeah.

Jason Hall: I think it's cautious optimism I think that word is right just caution maybe. Because these stocks really from the beginning of the year they're not doing great at all.

Jason Moser: No they're not and that's obviously because it's becoming very hyper-competitive environment and we'll talk a little bit about that when we discuss these together. Mastercard being the smaller of the two it feels like perhaps there's a little bit more of a growth opportunity there. I'm glad you mentioned the comp to 2019 numbers because clearly coming from 2020 that's maybe not as helpful but generally speaking this recovery rate we've seen with bank earnings here over the past several quarters the consumer is in a great spot. The consumer generally speaking has been at a very good spot. This job this employment issue not enough people to fill the jobs that are available out there is interesting to note. I feel like what remedies that is you just you could just go without a job for long enough and [laughs] you're going to run out of money that takes care of itself doesn't it?

Jason Hall: Yeah I think you're right. At the end of the day too if you think about the jobs that are open they're the jobs that people didn't really want to have two years ago anyway right?

Jason Moser: Yeah.

Jason Hall: People in the service industry if you've ever dealt with any kind of travel when people are already stressed hotel staff all of those sorts of jobs. That's the stuff that the people aren't filling so here we are. Given time I think you're right. I think that gets addressed.

Jason Moser: One thing I noticed in Mastercard's call and I'd be interested to hear your perspective on this because we've seen so much in the financial media landscape recently regarding the I-word inflation. That is the word of the day. Seemingly every day for the past several months. Clearly inflation is an issue. You have some folks arguing whether it's transitory or a bit more permanent in nature. I tend to feel like it's a little bit more permanent in nature but I guess we'll find out when we get there. But I did notice that the call with Mastercard. One of the questions was how does a business like this respond to inflation? Is inflation a good thing or a bad thing for a business like Mastercard? Management had an opinion there they said in the call they felt like if inflation is something where it's measured it's relatively modest it's paced you're not talking about some sort of hyperinflation type of environment. Typically that is going to end up being a tailwind for a business like Mastercard just based on the business model itself. I mean they're getting their interchange. They're getting the cents per transaction. I mean when you see something like inflation going through our economy at a measured pace ultimately the spending the dollars that are going through these networks are growing. Whether it's Mastercard or Visa they are going to benefit from that unless it's a hyperinflationary type of environment which can have other sorts of ongoing impacts.

Jason Hall: Yeah Jason this is exactly why FinTech is a thing. This is exactly why you have the Squares and the PayPals of the world that want a larger and larger portion of that payments business. Because at the end of the day the business model is so incredibly powerful. You mentioned operating leverage because even if inflation does affect them and their operating expenses to some extent the benefit is like orders of magnitude larger. In terms of you think about the revenues. These are [laughs] businesses that generate better than 50 points of gross margin so it is good. But again the risk and I really want to define it is if it's inflation that hurts the economy like really hurts the economy that's definitely not good. I think that's the key thing that they wanted to stress is that really it is good inflation which like it or not is a real thing. Good inflation is good for this business too much inflation that stalls the economy takes us back to where we were a year ago.

Jason Moser: Yeah well let's talk a little bit about Visa because very similar business of course a little bit bigger a very similar business. A little bit of a tougher week shares down about eight and a half percent. Again what I feel like it was a pretty good quarter I mean you saw numbers that indicate growth that indicate spending more dollars going through these networks more transactions happening. But there was one headline we saw throughout the week that I think along with the type of guidance and you could talk about that. But along with the type of guidance I think we're seeing Visa it seems like Visa's being targeted a little bit more by regulators here recently. Whether that's earned or not that's another debate entirely but it certainly feels like these relationships that they have with companies like Square and PayPal like you mentioned it started getting that headline where regulators looking into what you're doing and how you're making your business happen. Certainly that's going to create some near-term uncertainty I would think.

Jason Hall: This is a business that's gotten it's hand slapped in the past over anti-competitive practices. When you have more than half of the US share of those transactions regulators should be watching closely. Frankly I think it's good to have a dominant business for reasons but when you start running into anti-competitive practices I don't think it's a threat to the business but it's a risk that investors need to be very conscious of because if the company is forced to take steps that's going to cede some of their market guess what? That's the bottom line that's affected. I think you have to be conscious of that. I think the other thing too with Mastercard compared to I don't want to jump the gun here. But Visa's done an incredible job growing I mean it's gigantic even compared to Mastercard at least in the U.S. and overseas as well. But the growth opportunity for both of them is largely not just in these merchant transactions. You go into the store to buy stuff transactions you're getting a new Visa or Mastercard from your bank. That's great business and there's certainly growth there as the world moves to more digital transactions but you move to like business-to-business payments you think about the person-to-person payments. Those are like I don't know four times the size of the merchant markets that they do? I think Mastercard's done a better job there and I don't think that the market is responding to that. I don't think the market in general even really realizes broadly you know what I mean?

But I think the big thing for Visa is it was like one of those sell the news things. There was this expectation for guidance of being closer to 20 percent growth driven a lot by not just the strong transaction processing volumes that we've seen that have recovered and grown in some of these other areas. But just into like the whole travel thing started to get back to normal and that really important part of their business being just like gravy. Obviously management's not 100 percent sold that that's going to happen next fiscal year because they've just started their new fiscal year right now. It just doesn't seem like management's convinced that that's going to be like 20 percent revenue enough to push them to 20 percent revenue growth. Guidance was closer to like upper mid-teens right?

Jason Moser: Yeah. I'm glad you brought up all of these different ancillary almost. I shuttered a call on the ancillary because there's such a big market opportunities but I think so many people out there just think of Visa and Mastercard as the consumer card that is in your wallet. When you read into these two businesses both of them their strategy they start talking about this network of networks. That's why these businesses are so strong because there's such massive networks and they are looking to basically parlay that success of that mass of networking into the other networks within that network. I think that is part of the story that a lot of folks don't necessarily focus as much on but when you look at the sheer numbers involved you're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars moving around the world and these are two businesses with the networks that can absolutely help facilitate all of those different types of networks. Whether it's business to business business to consumer government to consumer whatever it may be.

Jason Hall: It's bananas how many of those transactions are still something that comes across an accounts payable department and they process it and an actual physical check comes off a printer somewhere goes into an envelope and gets mailed. Just the inefficiencies that are there are enormous and the ability to facilitate less human interaction drive a lot of those operational costs out but also speed up processing time. Because at the end of the day when there's money that's literally in the mail somewhere that's money that's not in your bank account. That's something that a lot of organizations they can improve their cash efficiency using what Visa and Mastercard can do. That's powerful.

Jason Moser: Yeah. That's exactly why I think you're seeing so much enthusiasm of companies like Bill.com for example. The company that just taking the world by storm here. If you look at the stock chart it's astounding honestly but it's because they're tackling that specific opportunity that you just talked about. The inefficiencies in small and medium-sized businesses just the nature of cutting physical checks. Just as an individual like when I have to cut an individual physical check I die a little bit inside sometimes.

Jason Hall: That's a moment that you will never get back in your entire life.

Jason Moser: I know.

Jason Hall: You're literally paying somebody and taking more of your time to pay them. It's 2021 come on what are we doing here?

Jason Moser: Well speaking of 2021 given the nature of FinTech this is a very fast-changing evolving space. There are a lot of different players and I get it. It is a massive market opportunity and there are a lot of hands in that cookie jar. Now some are going to succeed some are going to just disappear. But generally speaking and the conversation goes well this is FinTech. You look at Visa and Mastercard your days are numbered. I feel like that is a very simplistic argument that doesn't take into account a lot of the things that we just discuss there. But I'm curious to know how concerned should investors actually be about these two businesses being meaningfully disrupted from this move toward digital payments because I feel like maybe they're finding ways to participate as opposed to necessarily being edged out of the transaction entirely.

Jason Hall: Yeah. By and large I think that's the case is at the end of the day FinTech generally again we've only got a few minutes we can't really dive into this. We could do like a five-part show on this if you want to. That's what it would take to cover it. But I think the key thing to remember here is that the reason FinTech exists is all of these companies want to be in the middle. They want to participate somewhere in between you as the purchaser and me as the merchant. Or they want to be somewhere in between me and the bank or you and the bank. They want to be in that middle because it's so lucrative. Think about again those margins I mentioned that these companies generate at scale are enormous. You think about these relatively small fees that they charge to generate this incredible profitability. Being in the middle is really powerful. I think viewing Visa and Mastercard is at risk of disruption from that is inaccurate because they have competition. Competition is increasing and at the end of the day the network effect if your Visa and Mastercard is so strong. They have their relationships with the merchants already. The merchants trust them because they know they're going to get paid. The banks trust them because they know that they are secure and they have relationships with 99 percent of the merchants out there.

All of those things are there. If you're a consumer having their cards is either just a prerequisite because that's a debit card your bank offers or there's a rewards program that gives you some incentive and gets back to the power. There's so much strengthen that network effect that it's easy to overlook that. You know what it's hard to build that. It is really hard to build that. Technology has helped. It certainly helped the cloud has helped making it easier to build those networks out and attracts the different stakeholders and users. But I think sometimes we rushed to they're going to get disrupted and forget that guess what all these other FinTech companies that are in the same cabal. They want to do the same thing already and a lot of times they're going to partner with Visa and Mastercard anyway. I think we missed that. But to me Jason I think the biggest potential disruption is he who can pay me fastest and at the lowest structure fees wins. I think technology like blockchain is more likely to be a bigger source of disruption at some points than any of the FinTech players are to these businesses because it essentially eliminates the middle right?

Jason Moser: Yeah it seems like it improves the operating system. If you think of Visa and Mastercard these operating systems of the payments network and you search to their calls you'll see mention of blockchain frequently. They are utilizing that technology. So it's good to see them embracing that in order to be able to evolve because I think you're right. Getting that money from point A to point B as quickly as possible as cheaply as possible. That's ultimately what people want that's what businesses want that's what everybody wants. We're certainly finding new ways to do that and it feels like blockchain technology is going to be something that ultimately helps these businesses. To your point building a network like that. I think people just don't really think about the billions of cards that are out there with these brands on them. Whether it's Visa or Mastercard it's not easy to build that network. Regardless of your feelings of any particular FinTech operation that operating system is core to so much that's going on.

Jason Hall: Yeah no doubt about it. It really is. The other aspects of it too you have regulation in hundreds of countries and thousands of municipalities. The scale to have the resources to make sure you're meeting the regulations where you're doing business is another thing I think people forget about. Because the world is getting smaller and more international. Those are things I think that are easy to overlook. But at the end of the day the technology that gets people pay the fastest. When you can go from months to weeks that's great. But when you go from weeks to days that's incredible. But when you can go from days to now and again I think it's 5 10 years before that thing happens. The big problem with cryptocurrencies which are the monetary side of the blockchain is the volatility in value. Because sure it's great to be able to get it as a crypto asset but then they turn it into cash the thing that's still money that's another process in and of itself that has to be continually refined. But I think that's the biggest risk right now.

Jason Moser: Well the toughest week of them all goes to Robinhood. Robinhood earnings came out late last week as well. Shares had a tough week down about 11 and 1/2 percent in total. It feels like this is a polarizing business. There's some people who love it there some people who just can't stand it. I don't know that I would say I can't stand it but I certainly don't have any interest in owning these shares. Now you may feel differently but let's talk a little bit about the quarter because it did seem like they're starting to realize some challenges particularly because they are so heavily exposed to crypto.

Jason Hall: Yeah and it's certainly showing in what's going on with the user base. Bottom line it's not even just crypto but I think we're seeing the same thing just in their volume of stock transactions it's also coming down. Options might be the only part of the business that is actually doing OK.

Jason Moser: But how much of that do you think it's like the people don't fully understand what they're doing? There is a gambling sense to options unless you really actually know what's really going on.

Jason Hall: Yeah. No this isn't like Motley Fool Options. It's like the most boring possible way to do options that also generates income 97 percent of the time or whatever it is. Yeah it's gambling; it's just straight-up gambling. I think again that gets back to the big challenge with Robinhood from the beginning for so many long-term focused investors to say it's awesome that we have more people particularly young people that are thinking about making money with stocks. But it's like everything about the way their system is built gamifies it and turns it into the short-term quick-hit thing. If you look at the numbers if you look at something I sent a note to you. They reported third-quarter. They said that their monthly active users increased 76 percent and assets under custody increased 115 percent. But if you go back and look at the second quarter what you see is that they ended the second quarter with 21.3 million users they ended the third quarter with 18.9 million monthly active users; that's going the wrong way. Assets under custody ended the quarter at 95 billion they ended the second quarter at 102 billion. ARPU average revenues per user fell from $112 in Q2 to $65. Jason?

Jason Moser: That's a big drop.

Jason Hall: What do you think?

Jason Moser: Well there are a lot of different ways can look at Robinhood. I like the idea that we're getting a platform out there that wants to democratize investing and give everybody the access I feel like they can do a better job on the education side of things and maybe they'll get there. I think building that brokerage it can be sticky and from there once you have people in there then you can start rolling out educational and advisory services I think as you like. There's a lot of potential there. 22.4 million net cumulative funded accounts with $95 billion in assets under custody that sounds like a lot but when you do the math actually you're talking about the average net funded account $4200 a little over $4200 and that number is coming down. You don't have very high-value clients first and foremost right?

Jason Hall: Yeah. They lost about 100000.

Jason Moser: I'll bet you the median is far lower than that 4200. You're looking at a business that clearly they're doing some neat things but you have to wonder about the market that they are actually pursuing the demographic that they're pursuing. Because look at something like Charles Schwab for example Charles Schwab $7 1/2 trillion in assets under management and it's a $154 billion company. You've got Robinhood with just under $100 billion in assets under custody that's a $30 billion company. Those numbers don't even come close to making sense. There's clearly a lot of enthusiasm there for Robinhood I just feel like it's not been earned yet.

Jason Hall: I agree Jason. I want to like this business I really do.

Jason Moser: Yeah I do to.

Jason Hall: I want to like it so much you know what I mean? I think there's levers they can pull. You start adding IRAs you start letting people do rollovers and open up a Roth and start really thinking about the long-term distance future. I know they're working on those things. Maybe that can turn these losses and users that we're seeing maybe it can start turning that around. But how long has this company going public earlier this year?

Jason Moser: Yeah just a bit of a short time.

Jason Hall: Yeah. Thirty-five dollars a share IPOed at 38. The market is obviously nowhere near convinced.

Jason Moser: No.

Jason Hall: Is it going to be able to turn it around right?

Jason Moser: It's obviously very competitive environment. You've got companies out there like Public.com which is not public but if you've ever interfaced with Public that is a very slick mobile fast experience for investing. They really embrace the educational side of it. Much less of a focus on just things like crypto and options building neat thematic ETFs. When I see a company like Public and that to me I feel like Public is playing the long game whereas Robinhood is not quite sure what they're doing yet and that's what really concerns me.

Jason Hall: Yeah. I think that says it well. Here's the thing though the business is strong it's tons of money in the bank. Starting to burn cash though. Cash burn I think it's a real concern. The economics should be really good with this kind of business that it should generate pretty good operating cash flows but that's not the case this year. I think that's a real concern because when you're losing users when your average account balances are falling trading is falling your average revenue per user is down 40 percent those are some real things particularly for a cash-burning business. As much as I want to like the business I wouldn't touch the stock right now until the metrics they have to earn it right Jason? They have to earn it right now they're not.

Jason Moser: We'll leave it there. I think that's going to do it for us this week Jason. Thanks so much for taking the time to be here.

Working with Closed Loop Partners’ Consortium to reinvent the bag Walmart is testing several concepts including some that use mobile technology. CVS and Target are also part of the consortium.

Jane Ewing senior vice president of sustainability at Walmart said a store in Santa Clara Calif. has tested a plan called Fill It Forward a mobile app and RFID tag that connects to a reusable bag customers already own.

With each use customers accumulate points which convert to a dollar amount that goes back to a local organization. The Santa Clara test donated funds to the Second Harvest Food Bank of Silicon Valley. Walmart said Fill It Forward caused a 31% increase in adoption of reusable bags during its run.

Walmart Store No. 2280 in Mountain View Calif. tested a mobile app-enabled idea called GOATOTE which enables customers to use an app to “check out” reusable bags. The bags are free if returned to the store within 30 days. If they decide to keep their bag customers will be charged $2.

The tests in California are in addition to ongoing tests on the East Coast. Ewing said its stores in Vermont are bagless and completely transitioned to reusable bags working with the state’s sustainability initiatives. She said there also is a bagless pilot in Maine. Ewing said customers in the states have told the retailer they were ready to make the change.

“By choosing to go bagless in Maine and Vermont we’re learning a lot that we can share with other regions. And though these transitions come with a learning curve for customers and associates they’ve also shown that Walmart customers have a deep desire to do the right thing for our planet and our collective future” Ewing said.

She said Walmart is aware that reinventing the retail bag won’t be easy or quick. Ewing said the retail giant is encouraged by the process made in these four test markets and innovative solutions that came out of the consortium’s work.

“Key learnings from these efforts will inform our future bagless efforts. We’ll keep working to do our part to serve the customer while moving toward a cleaner more sustainable future” Ewing said.

Walmart has not publicly disclosed how many bags it uses annually but sustainability advocate As You Sow estimated in 2020 that Walmart distributes up to 20 billion single-use bags per year. Kroger said it distributes 6 billion bags annually and has also agreed to phase out single-use bags by 2025.

As You Sow also reports more than 470 U.S. municipalities in 28 states now ban or charge fees for single-use plastic carry out bags. California Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Maine New York Oregon and Vermont and more than 50 countries have taken action to ban or restrict plastic bags. The environmental group said U.S. plastic bag recycling rates are estimated at less than 5%.

Walmart pledged in 2008 to reduce its global plastic shopping bag waste by an average of 33% per store by 2013. In it’s latest Environmental Sustainability Governance report in 2020 Walmart said plastic bags only account for an estimated 6% of the retailer’s plastic packaging footprint in the U.S.

Walmart said it encourages consumers to pack bags fully at check-out and it also has plastic bag collection bins in the entry ways of its stores. Walmart said it is making progress in the test markets with the Consortium and in Canada the goal is to reduce single-use plastic bags by 50% from 2018 to 2025. There is no overall U.S. goal set.

Walmart is testing a new replacement for single-use plastic shopping bags. Working with Closed Loop Partners’ Consortium to reinvent the bag Walmart is testing several concepts including some that use mobile technology. CVS and Target are also part of the consortium.

Jane Ewing senior vice president of sustainability at Walmart said a store in Santa Clara Calif. has tested a plan called Fill It Forward a mobile app and RFID tag that connects to a reusable bag customers already own.

With each use customers accumulate points which convert to a dollar amount that goes back to a local organization.

With the goal of attracting mothers and working parents Amazon announced this week that workers in certain roles ranging from warehouse to delivery can cancel a shift “in as little as 16 hours” before it begins or can swap shifts with other employees at the last minute. Meanwhile Starbucks is testing a “shifts app” aimed at making it easier for employees to work available shifts to meet their personal needs. (The latter also comes as Starbucks baristas in New York state are looking to unionize.)

In recent years employers including Walmart began to offer more job flexibility amid the tight US labor market and a growing number of companies have followed. Job postings offering “flexibility” jumped from 6.4% in 2016 to 20% in 2021 according to data from ZipRecruiter. Flexibility is becoming more of a norm for all jobs in the US—and that has accelerated during the pandemic.

In a tight labor market traditional work-site employers are now competing against the growing number of remote-friendly companies says Julia Pollak a chief economist at ZipRecruiter. For instance call centers which before the pandemic required workers to make calls from a central location are now allowing them to make their calls from home. Even at jobs that require workers to be on-site some employers are allowing workers to complete administrative tasks at home she adds.

“As a result the on-site employers are having to somehow sweeten the pot and offer a little bit more flexibility because they’re losing huge numbers of workers to employers who are more flexible” she says. “If they can’t compete on space they’re competing on time.”

The unpredictable nature of low-wage jobs

Historically flexibility was not on the employee’s side. A 2015 study from the University of Chicago found retail workers reported concerns about short notice of their work schedules and unpredictable changes which would interfere with child care and other aspects of home life and contributed to turnover. Over three-fourths of both part-time and full-time employees reported receiving one week or less notice of the days and hours they would need to work according to the study.

Scheduling software focused on boosting company’s revenues such as Walmart’s in 2007 which moved workers from predictable hours to when there was customer demand. That led to workers feeling like they have no control over their schedule. In 2014 Starbucks baristas voiced objections to a system that forced them to work shifts with only a few hours break between them. Their resentment forced the coffee chain to make their scheduling practices more employee-friendly such as by preventing managers from booking employees to work shifts with less than eight hours in between.

The systems have gotten more sophisticated by integrating with software like Slack and Facebook Messenger to make communication more seamless says Jayson Saba a senior director of product management at UKG a global HR and workforce management company. The pandemic forced wider adoption.

But given how companies have used them in the past some are still skeptical of the updated scheduling practices. “Flexibility is a buzzword which really means last minute scheduling and unpredictable lives for low-wage earners” said Stuart Appelbaum president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union in an email to Quartz. “The rise of this practice is just the latest cover for long-standing scheduling issues which leave workers in precarious positions. Without fair scheduling practices workers cannot plan their lives take care of their children or elderly parents take a necessary second job or seek additional training or courses to advance their careers.”

A number of cities including San Francisco Seattle and New York City have established scheduling laws with universal standards for scheduling hourly workers in industries like retail food service and hospitality.

When the labor shortage eases the benefit could disappear says Ruth Milkman a professor at the City University of New York’s School of Labor and Urban Studies. “All that said this is definitely something workers care about… so even if it’s only due to the current labor shortage it’s good to see some effort to address it however limited” she says.

The future of low-wage work is more flexibility?

Amazon the second largest employer in the US tends to set the bar for what other low-wage employers provide their workers. The company—which raised its average hourly US wages to $18 an hour—is struggling to attract workers and in its most recent earnings call mentioned how it is spending a lot more to overcome supply chain difficulties. Flexible scheduling can help make employers like Amazon more attractive says Saba.

“Everyone is getting paid pretty much the same in these types of jobs no matter where they go” he says. “So it’s not a money piece anymore. How are we going to differentiate and how are we going to adapt to meet that? It comes down to that.”

Overall the pandemic is forcing employers to streamline their hiring process by improving how they post and advertise job postings says Pollak. “When you have to learn to attract workers in a tight labor market you have to just improve as an employer and be a better employer” she says. “And once you’ve made those improvements I don’t think you dial them back.”

It’s still in the early days but the improvements in conditions and wages of jobs that need to be done on-site can unlock huge potential for these workers. At the same time when companies switch to more flexible scheduling they often don’t see employees working less resulting in everybody working shifts that make them happier with no overall decline in productivity and higher retention says Pollak.

“It’s an exciting shift” she says. “Whenever you have this huge shift of winners and losers and the losers need to play catch up and figure out what to do it can improve outcomes for everybody.”"

Surprisingly the Master of Suspense almost made a movie set in the Happiest Place on Earth. Or at least he wanted to ...

While sadly not a sequel to Vertigo in which Jimmy Stewart anxiously rides the Matterhorn Bobsleds the idea first came from screenwriter Ernest Lehman who had previously penned Hitch’s North by Northwest the beloved classic featuring Cary Grant James Mason and a less-than-subtle dick joke ending.

Lehman had an idea for a movie about a blind jazz pianist (to be played by Stewart) who gains his sight after a miraculous eye transplant. Adding to the scientific dubiousness of the story once the hero has new eyes he suddenly experiences visions of his own murder; memories belonging to the eyes’ previous owner. Perhaps to distract from the fact this makes no goddamn sense whatsoever the flashbacks would have been brought on by a staged wild west show at Disneyland. Hitch even suggested that “the whole movie could be made in Disneyland.”

Despite the fact that much of the story plays like a glorified commercial for Disney’s relatively new park with the protagonist wanting to immediately witness the glory of teacup rides and tantrums with his newly-installed peepers Walt himself was less than enthused about the idea. When news of the project first hit the trades Disney freaked out and issued a statement to the press about how much he hated Hitchcock’s recent Psycho. According to Disney he wouldn’t even let his kids watch that “disgusting” movie so he definitely wouldn’t let its director into his precious faux-utopia.

After Disney’s harsh rejection the movie (somewhat unimaginatively called The Blind Man) eventually fizzled out even after Lehman tried to write around the problem by shifting most of the story to a luxury cruise ship. But The Blind Man was revived more than fifty years later for a 2015 BBC radio drama with a “completed” script by Mark Gatiss of Doctor Who and Sherlock fame. It stars Hugh Laurie rather than Dana Carvey doing a Jimmy Stewart impression but it’s still pretty good. And since it required no actual filming and Walt Disney is long dead/frozen it does contain several scenes set in Disneyland.

And if anyone ever wants to do an actual movie version of the script there is a precedent for clandestine film shoots on Disney property …

After previously unveiling a few of the acts that would be featured in this love letter to the art of Disney Animation Cirque du Soleil and Disney revealed two more of the amazing acrobatic performances set to amaze audiences upon the show’s debut: “Garden of Lines” unicycle and “The Old Mill” double wheel acts.

Drawn to Life written and directed by Michel Laprise with Fabrice Becker as Director of Creation is a live acrobatic journey telling the story of Julie a determined girl who discovers an unexpected gift left by her Disney Animator father: an unfinished animation. As she dives into the inner world of animation guided by a surprising pencil Julie embarks on an inspiring quest filled with her childhood Disney memories. Developed in partnership with Michael Jung Executive Theatrical Development Walt Disney Imagineering along with Walt Disney Animation Studios the story is driven by 10 unique acrobatic acts alongside animation from beloved Disney films. In addition the show features all-new animation created by Disney artists led by Animation Director Eric Goldberg best known for characters such as the Genie in the Disney Animation classic “Aladdin.”

In the “Garden of Lines” unicycle act Julie is swept into a wonderland of familiar shadows shapes and outlines in an homage to cherished tales that inspire an animator. Julie’s whimsical mood fixates on a mischievous marionette from a time-honored Italian fairytale. Five playful unicyclists representing the Blue Fairy of the classic Disney Animation film “Pinocchio” appear to effortlessly float across the stage performing synchronized stunts and individual tricks with pinpoint precision.

“The Old Mill” double wheel act is inspired by Walt Disney’s groundbreaking 1937 animated short of the same name which is seen in projections throughout. In a display of tenacity perseverance and rise-and-fall motion owls dreamed up by Julie’s imagination weather a storm using teamwork and courage to carry them through the powerful wind and rain that threaten their windmill home. The windmill of the film is represented in a spectacular churning fast-moving double-wheel structure. Gravity-defying acrobats are in constant motion with the turning wheels—at times airborne—with astonishing balance and agility.

Drawn to Life is the 50th production created by Cirque du Soleil and its premiere coincides with the Walt Disney World Resort 50th anniversary celebration. With an international cast of 62 artists Drawn to Life will perform Tuesday through Saturday at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World Resort.

In advance of the show’s premiere Cirque du Soleil and Disney fans can now visit the Cirque du Soleil store at Disney Springs West Side for merchandise.

(Inti Ocon/AFP/Getty Images)

Nicaraguans are voting today in the country's elections as the international community raises concerns over the legitimacy of the process following the arrests of dozens of opposition leaders.

Many Nicaraguans have raised doubts over whether they'd vote in the election due to overall distrust in their institutions.

Some background: Ortega's government cracked down hard on opposition figures during the anti-government protests of 2018. At least 322 people were killed then with thousands injured and hundreds detained. At the time UN human rights experts accused the government of human rights violations against protesters. Ortega said the UN report was ""nothing more than an instrument of the policy of death of the policy of terror of the policy of lying of the policy of infamy.""

The government of long-time President Daniel Ortega has detained dozens of people since late May including seven presidential candidates. Opposition leaders student leaders businessmen and activists have also been targeted.

Many of the dozens detained since May have been charged with vague so-called ""national security"" violations which human rights groups say is a clear sign that Ortega is doing his best to eliminate dissent and crush any competition ahead of the elections when he hopes to secure his fourth consecutive term as president.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel three-prong solid waste reduction project was on Thursday launched in the Chambers Pen community in western Hanover by the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) in collaboration with its western regional arm the Western Parks and Market Waste Management Limited.

The project is also being supported by the Jamaica Agricultural Society the Rural Agricultural Development Authority Jamaica Cultural Development Commission the Social Development Commission and HEART/NSTA.

It involves a community competition in composting plastic bottle separation from household waste and the proper containerisation of household waste.

According to Aretha McFarlane operations director at the NSWMA the objective of the project is to educate all participants about the techniques of composting with a view to having the farmers and community members actively involved in solid waste reduction.

HOLISTIC APPROACH

With over 60 garbage drums distributed to community members for both garbage storage and composting activities under the project McFarlane said the NSWMA has taken a holistic approach in Chambers Pen to deal with the garbage situation.

“We will have prizes and surprises in the competition aspect of the project where areas in the community will be competing against each other in the composting and plastic bottle separation aspects” McFarlane told members of the community in selling the idea to them.

Among the prizes at stake for the various winners are garden tools chickens and chicken feed water tanks a deep freezer and a weekend for two at a hotel.

“We (at the NSWMA) want this project to be sustainable because there are benefits not only for you now but even after the competition while you (community members) want a clean safe and healthy environment in which to live to grow your children and to enjoy your everyday life” said McFarlane.

Audley Gordon the executive director of the NSWMA who spoke at the launch noted that a high percentage of garbage being generated in homes is compostable adding that the process of composting is one of the easiest ways to achieve a reduction in solid waste.

“When we compost we achieve the reducing (of solid waste) we achieve the reusing and we achieve the recycling” noted Gordon.

According to Gordon the project is being launched in Chambers Pen with a view to extending it across Jamaica based on the impact it should have on that community.

“With a small investment of time (in composting) you can contribute to the solution of the country’s waste management problem” stated Gordon adding that nationally 67 per cent of the volume of garbage which is being packaged and left for collection at gates is compostable.

While outlining the cost input for transporting garbage to disposal sites Gordon said that at a cursory glance the numbers are showing the possibility of huge savings if people start to practise composting within their households.

“Just a cursory glance at the numbers it is showing up a savings of close to $2 billion a year for taxpayers were we to get composting going. That figure is reflective of the smaller amount of disposal sites that we would maintain the fewer trucks and workers that we would need therefore we do ourselves as a country a favour when we compost” emphasised Gordon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVsZXBoYW50LmluZm8vYW5hbHlzaXMvMjAyMS8xMS8wNi9kdW1wZWQtZS13YXN0ZS10aHJlYXRlbnMta2VueWFuLWxpdmVzLWNvbnRyaWJ1dGVzLXRvLWdsb2JhbC13YXJtaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dumped E-Waste Threatens Kenyan Lives Contributes to Global Warming,"On a cold Friday afternoon in July Wambui is standing in the doorway of her roadside shop scrolling on her tablet. The street outside is empty. A woman wrapped in a Maasai shawl sits in a white plastic chair inside the shop. In front of her are plastic toys vacuum cleaners and electronic cutting equipment. A CCTV camera is mounted in the ceiling.

The shop is on a busy street in Ngara Nairobi and as I approach Wambui calls to me to have a look at her wares.

“UK fridges are of high quality” says the shopkeeper. A small refrigerator with no brand name is going for KSh20000. “But I’ll sell it to you for KSh18000. It is the best I can do” she says.

Wambui has been in the business of selling imported second-hand appliances for about a decade. She says it is impossible to recall the number of cooling appliances she has sold all imported from the UK through a middleman.

Inside the freezer compartment of one of the fridges are phone numbers in blue; 0870 is a premium help number for Domestic and General a repair company in the United Kingdom 0121 is a Birmingham number for spares. Birmingham is the United Kingdom’s second largest city.

Large imports

Despite being a signatory to international treaties regulating and banning the dumping of damaged and end-of-life electronics Kenya still imports large quantities of electronic and electrical goods that are considered too inefficient to be sold in the country of origin. The appliances enter the country legally and a tax is paid to customs for their clearance.

Nairobi Mombasa and Eldoret have thriving second-hand markets for cooling appliances numerous repair shops and dealers in scrap. I visited some 20 shops the majority of which were selling appliances from the United Kingdom while others were trading in appliances from Germany United States India and even Sweden in one case.

Nearly all the shops have an online presence either on Facebook on Instagram Pigiame.co.ke and Jiji.co.ke while some use WhatsApp groups to post photos of appliances and their prices.

But this trade in obsolete and inefficient second-hand cooling appliances that are harmful to the climate is not regulated. In effect Kenya lacks a proper e-waste law and does not have the capacity to manage hazardous substances from cooling appliances that have reached the end of their life. An Electronic Waste Bill was formulated in 2013 but was never passed into law.

“Heavy metals like mercury zinc cadmium are harmful when they come into contact with the human body or natural resources like water” says Boniface Mbithi the Chief Executive Officer of WEEE Centre an e-waste recycling company. “When plants absorb water that is already contaminated with heavy metals and people eat these plants [this] causes cancer kidney failure or even leads to mental disorders.”

This trade in obsolete and inefficient second-hand cooling appliances that are harmful to the climate is not regulated.

Tony a fridge repairman sells fridge compressors and freezers from Germany and the United Kingdom. He cannot afford direct shipments like Wambui but he has his way of getting around that obstacle; sourcing his goods from towns like Mandera and Garissa that border Ethiopia is his best alternative. He is unaware that old inefficient refrigerators can leak harmful gases into the atmosphere during repair.

“I have to check if they are working before they are released into the market. Some come broken. I repair them refill the gas and change the compressor” Tony said. But despite his best efforts not all appliances are reparable. Those Tony says are sold as scrap in the informal recycling sector.

Unaware of the harm refrigerants can cause scrap dealers release the gases into the atmosphere as they try to recover valuable components from the appliances contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer and to climate change.

Improper disposal

Brian Waswala Olewe an environmental education specialist at Maasai Mara University notes “Improper disposal of the refrigerant into the environment destroys air quality and affects health. . . . Freon an odourless gas cuts off oxygen supply to organs and cells and leads to cardiac arrest and death when deeply inhaled.”

Yet Kenya does not have accurate data on imports of cooling appliances especially refrigerators and air conditioners. The Customs Department of the Kenya Revenue Authority claims that it does not have specific records of the second-hand cooling appliances entering the country because most imports of these electronics come in consignments together with other goods.

Although Kenya is a signatory to the Montreal Protocol – an international treaty to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which may be contained in cooling appliances – these refrigerants are still finding their way into the country.

A common trend in the Kenyan second-hand market is the sale of electronics without appliance specifications making it impossible for consumers to determine the quality of the products they are buying. Without these details it was impossible to identify the refrigerants present (the compounds that provide refrigeration in air conditioners and fridges) in the appliances sold at Hoist Refrigeration Services a major dealership in Utawala along the Eastern Bypass in Nairobi.

However investigations show that the presence of R134a a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant is rife. Although R134a does not pose a threat to the ozone layer because it does not contain chlorine it is still a potent greenhouse gas with a very high potential to cause global warming and its production is being phased out under Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.

“We call it an Ex-UK fridge” explains a saleswoman who is clearly ignorant of the chemical makeup of the electronics on display at Hoist Refrigeration Services. “I have sold so many ex-UK fridges and have never had a complaint about the energy consumption” the seller said. But contrary to the seller’s claims a UNEP report on energy efficiency standards states that Kenyans spend an additional US$50 to US$100 on electricity every year because of using obsolete and inefficient second-hand equipment and appliances.

Banned substances

An environmental dumping report released in 2020 by the environmental campaign group CLASP and the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development revealed that the air conditioners sold in Kenya contain banned and environmentally harmful substances with 37 per cent not meeting energy efficiency ratings above 3.0 W/W a common standard around the world.

According to the report Kenya imported between 30000 to 40000 air conditioners of which 27 per cent contained R-22 (Freon) a refrigerant that contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer and is being phased out; 4 per cent contained R-32 a refrigerant that contributes highly to global warming; and 69 per cent contained R410a. (One kilogram of this refrigerant has the same greenhouse impact as two tonnes of carbon dioxide.)

The obsolete and harmful refrigerants and appliances were imported from China Malaysia Thailand and India.

Tad Ferris Senior Counsel for the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development and lead author of the joint report said the units are “energy vampires” sucking up vital energy needed to recover from the pandemic and the economic slowdown and inflating consumer spending on electricity bills.

Kenyans spend an additional US$50 to US$100 on electricity every year because of using obsolete and inefficient second-hand equipment and appliances.

However the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) has denied the existence of electronics without labels in the market. In an email response EPRA which is responsible for monitoring and labelling of quality standards and energy performance of electronic equipment in Kenya said “The Authority does compliance inspections on a monthly basis across the country and has not seen any household refrigeration appliances and split-type non-ducted air conditioners lacking labels.” The email further said “not all cooling appliances are governed by the standards and labelling scheme.”

In Kenya the energy efficiency label is a red and green tag that awards a maximum of five stars on electronics and electrical appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators. Minimum Energy Performance Standards are outlined in KS 2464: 2020 by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) the country’s quality and standards body. To enter the market appliances must be inspected and cleared by KEBS and other enforcing agencies including the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and Customs.

The Energy (Appliances’ Energy Performance and Labelling) Regulations were introduced in 2016 and promoted by CLASP and the Kenyan government under the Kigali Cooling Efficiency Program (KCEP). However although Kenya has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 32 per cent by 2030 to comply with the Paris Agreement under the revised National Determined Contributions (NDCs) it has yet to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal protocol that restricts the production entry and use of HFCs such as R134a.

Not only do second-hand cooling appliances consume more energy and rely mostly on fossil-based energy to power them they contain refrigerants that have the capacity to warm the atmosphere thousands of times more than carbon dioxide. A Study shows that the cooling appliances industry contributes significantly to climate change and accounts for 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

According to Dr Collins Odote an environmental lawyer and Associate Dean at the Faculty of Law of Nairobi University for Kenya to reduce greenhouse emissions and combat climate change the country must eliminate the importation and use of banned substances reduce reliance on fossil fuels and use clean energy. Kenya is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. The country’s economy depends largely on tourism agriculture forestry and fishing all sectors that are susceptible to climate change Odote says adding that the increased temperatures contribute to the loss of billions of shillings through droughts famine floods and human displacement.

Bribery and corruption

In order to get a sense of how these operations run under the radar of the authorities I presented myself to some of the dealers as a prospective player in the business. It turns out that for bulk imports which are cheaper a contact — often a relative — in the exporting country is required.

Moreover money to bribe your way out of the port is a necessity some said and there were allegations that not bribing certain officials could result in clearance delays or impounded goods.

One of the dealers was open to doing business with me against payment of KSh10000 for a connection to a middleman based in the UK. The deal didn’t go through however as a few days later the middleman declined.

The obsolete and harmful refrigerants and appliances were imported from China Malaysia Thailand and India.

Experts say that rich countries are dumping e-waste in developing countries such as Kenya under the guise of exporting second-hand appliances. Exporting e-waste non-functioning or near-end-of-life or environmentally harmful refrigerants is a criminal act under the Basel Convention and the European Union Waste Shipment Regulation.

Yet according to a United Nations University study of transboundary movements of used and waste electronic and electrical equipment (UEEE) between 2008 and 2013 184 tonnes of used freezers and fridges worth €1.5 million were exported to Eastern African countries including Kenya.The study analysed EU exports of second-hand refrigerators freezers laptops and desktop computers considered as waste using trade statistics from the EU COMEXT database. The analysis revealed that most exports came from Germany and Great Britain. The study did not capture data on electronics exported unconventionally and therefore the number of cooling appliances could be higher.

This indiscriminate dumping of e-waste from developed countries is exacerbating the problem of e-waste management in Kenya where just one per cent of the 51.3 tonnes of e-waste generated domestically is properly managed and recycled while the rest is discarded carelessly in dumpsites and in rivers incinerated thrown into pit latrines or left in homes.

Speaking in an interview Dr Ayub Macharia Director of Environmental Education in the Ministry of Environment said “Kenya is a victim of illegal movement of e-waste from developed countries.”

To curb dumping of e-waste in Kenya Dr Macharia declared a ban on the importation of second-hand electronic devices starting January 2020. But the ban mainly affected old cell phones computers and laptops sent by donors to schools and institutions and not obsolete cooling appliances.

Kenya’s biggest dumpsite

Dandora is Kenya’s fourth largest slum and home to the biggest dumpsite in Kenya. It is high noon but the sky here is grey from the swirls of smoke rising from burning waste.

Kevin a scrap dealer sits in front of a shack constructed from rusty corrugated iron sheets held together with cable and wire mesh. The middle-aged man agrees to divulge the secrets of his business anonymously.

“A client who imports sells me the broken ones. I get ex-UK Japan and German-made appliances” Kevin says. “I remove the copper and sell to jewellers or I take the copper to industrial Area Mlolongo or Cabanas to be exported to China.”

Kenya does not mine copper but the copper collected at scrapyards like this one is exported to countries like China and the UK generating significant revenues for the country.

Kevin says he is just a tiny fish in the pond that is Kenya’s copper export market; politically connected people run the big deals. Security operatives visit his shop on a daily basis to collect bribes; he has secretly stashed away a large amount of copper in a storeroom somewhere to avoid exploitation from corrupt “CID” officers.

“Utachukua dawa? (Will you buy copper?) ” an e-waste scavenger asks Kevin.

The copper trade is flourishing despite the harm caused to the environment and people by the release of refrigerants into the air. Kevin doesn’t have a degassing machine; he doesn’t see the need for one. He leaks refrigerants directly into the atmosphere as he recovers valuables like copper or steel.

One of the dealers was open to doing business with me against payment of KSh10000 for a connection to a middleman based in the UK.

“There is no harm. The gases don’t have odour” an ignorant Kevin says adding “That is a scientific theory. Even if it had you cannot compare such pollution with one caused by a motorcycle.”

Kenya does not mine copper so Kevin cannot get a licence to trade in the mineral. But the illegal trading the harassment from corrupt government officials and the information that refrigerants cause harm to people and to the climate have not deterred him. Kevin says he’s already teaching his son the business.

“Utachukua dawa?” (Will you buy copper?) another waste scavenger asks Kevin.

This new business deal brings our chat to an end.

In another area of the dumpsite James is sitting in his wood and corrugated iron shanty extracting copper from a fridge using a hammer. Around him are sacks containing various bits of scrap. To extract the copper from the appliances the scavengers around Dandora use crude equipment exposing other heavy metals and releasing gases into the air in the process. They complain of chest pains that they say are caused by the dark smoke emanating from the dumpsite.

James says he already has KSh200000 worth of copper in a secret storeroom. The scrap copper is from fridges construction sites and other sources. He hopes to collect KSh1000000 million worth of copper and maybe sell it by the end of the year. The copper will be exported to the United Kingdom he says.

E-waste scavengers come carrying loads of copper that James weighs and pays for. He cannot tell where the copper brought to him has come from.

As I leave the dumpsite rain falls from the heavy clouds above. In a few minutes the water will flow in ditches and find its way into the Nairobi River a few miles away from the slum.

Hazardous substances

Scientific studies have confirmed the presence of dangerous elements such as lead which present a serious hazard to human health at the dumpsite. A study commissioned by UNEP found high levels of heavy metals in the surrounding environment and in the bodies of local residents.

Rich countries are dumping e-waste in developing countries such as Kenya under the guise of exporting second-hand appliances.

Lead and cadmium levels were 13500 ppm (parts per million) and 1058 ppm respectively compared to action levels in the Netherlands of 150 ppm and 5ppm for these heavy metals. But because of the economic gains that they derive from the business residents and collectors are not willing to abandon it or to move from the site.

To make matters worse Kenya “[does] not have regulations that guide in e-waste management and disposal we have them in draft” says Dr Catherine Mbaisi Acting Deputy Director Environmental Education and Awareness National Environment Management Authority (NEMA).

This means that influxes of obsolete cooling appliances through porous borders will continue to flood the market. According to Dr Mbaisi the Ministry of Environment has formulated Extended Producer Responsibility Regulations that will render the manufacturer responsible for the entire life cycle of a product including a take-back scheme recycling and final disposal. She hopes the bill will be enacted.

Controlled Substances Regulations 2020 have also been formulated but have yet to be enacted. The regulations will promote the use of ozone-friendly substances and products and ensure the elimination of those that deplete the ozone layer. They need to be urgently enacted because lack of regulation and the lax control of energy-hungry toxic goods is putting Kenyan lives at risk and harming the environment.

WAT,Waters Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5zdHJ1bWVudGF0aW9uL0JlaGluZC1iYW5uZXIteWVhci1XYXRlcnMvOTkvaTQx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Behind a banner year at Waters,"Credit: Waters

When a company’s stock price doubles over the course of a year—and during a global pandemic no less—something must be going right. And when the company is the instrument maker Waters it’s tempting to tell a simple story: in September 2020 the firm lured Udit Batra from a senior post at Merck KGaA to be its CEO.

Waters at a glance ▸ Headquarters: Milford Massachusetts ▸ 2020 sales: $2.4 billion ▸ Employees: 7400 with 1112 in R&D roles ▸ Businesses: Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry thermal analysis rheometry and calorimetry instruments. Markets are pharmaceuticals (59% of sales) other industries (30%) and academia and government (11%).

Over the ensuing 12 months Waters’s stock went from $212 to $417 per share the biggest increase in the instrumentation industry after years in which Waters lagged the field. The firm’s profit in the first 9 months of 2021 was 39% higher than in 2020 and sales were up 23%. Rock star CEO. Done next article.

A closer look reveals a more nuanced narrative. With a leading presence in quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) instruments and consumables for the drug industry Waters was in an excellent position to thrive during one of the largest medical research development and deployment efforts in human history. Many of the firm’s competitors—in its core business of liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) as well as to its TA Instruments brand of material characterization instruments—also had banner years.

Batra doesn’t claim to be a knight in shining armor but he’s also not shy about sharing the areas of improvement he’s identified at Waters and the progress he and his team have made in addressing them. Company veterans and outside observers say that Batra deserves credit for at least some of the gains in the past year and that he’s setting Waters up for continued success.

One change is a greater emphasis on external partnerships. Waters has long focused on organic growth building business through R&D and internally developed products while competitors such as Agilent Technologies and PerkinElmer supplement internal efforts by acquiring smaller analytical tool firms. Batra says organic growth is still the number 1 priority but the firm has evaluated 9000 possible acquisitions over the past year. He’s also open to partnerships that let Waters do something no one else is doing.

For example analytical tools to support biotech methods of drug development and manufacturing are a natural outgrowth of Waters’s strength in QA/QC Batra said at a recent investor event. But it isn’t an area that the company can enter alone.

To this end on Oct. 20 Waters unveiled an R&D partnership with the University of Delaware on analytical characterization of biologic drugs during manufacturing. Six days later Waters announced a deal to integrate its BioAccord LC/MS with the Ambr bioreactor system from the bioprocessing equipment maker Sartorius.

Waters has collaborated plenty in its 63-year history but Batra has brought a new perspective according to John Gebler the firm’s director of biopharma strategic growth. “Those bioprocessing companies will admit to us they’re not experts in analytics. And we’re not experts in bioprocessing; that’s not what we sell” Gebler says. “Udit has brought this opportunity for us to collaborate and partner in a very meaningful way.”

As exemplified in the Sartorius deal Batra and Gebler are working to place instruments in bioprocessing labs and plants instead of just having them at a customer’s centralized MS lab. That shifts instrument and interface design priorities because bioprocessing users are typically not mass spectrometrists Gebler says.

Researchers and technicians “at line” in a development or manufacturing lab aren’t inclined to tinker in the guts of an instrument. “They want to use the instrument as a tool for them to get their job done” Gebler says. “Under the hood you need to have extraordinary sophistication to make that happen.”

Another shift in strategy since Batra took over is that Waters will no longer shy away from cannabis a fast-growing market for analytical technologies. “I know that we are moving so we can play in that marketplace” Gebler says.

Batra is also overhauling the company’s performance management system and realigning its sales team to make better use of e-commerce and data Waters has on older instruments ready for replacement. “We lost track of that sort of customer” Batra says but now the team is a third of the way through a backlog of 8000 instruments that are past their normal 5-to-7-year replacement cycle.

“Waters has been a leader in the industry right? It had occupied the pole position for a long time and then we just fell off” Batra says. Shortcomings included internal business practices that needed reform a loss of focus on the company’s core expertise and missed opportunities in new customer categories such as contract research and manufacturing.

Batra says employees at all levels have been receptive to what he wants to do. “When we started to talk about how to kind of get back to the podium I said ‘Let’s throw a stone.’ They said ‘Let’s throw a brick.’ There was no resistance.”

Udit has brought this opportunity for us to collaborate and partner in a very meaningful way. John Gebler director of biopharma strategic growth Waters

Glenn Cudiamat CEO of the market research firm TDA Research says Batra’s subject-matter expertise has helped him get the company behind such changes. Batra has a PhD in chemical engineering and has worked in labs and management at Johnson & Johnson Novartis and Merck KGaA. He’s as comfortable talking with technical experts as he is with executives. Cudiamat says that credibility has helped Batra win the support of Waters’s staff.

That said since he started as CEO four of the eight members of Waters’s executive leadership team are new or in new roles. Cudiamat says scientific instrumentation firms are seeing a lot of turnover which can cut both ways. It’s a balance between retaining culture and institutional knowledge and making room for new talent. “I feel like he’s doing it exceptionally well” Cudiamat says of Batra.

With the demand boost due to the pandemic Batra has the benefit of leading Waters during a time of expansion for the products it sells. TDA predicts growth this year of 15% in the high-performance liquid chromatrography (HPLC) and LC/MS markets 13% in thermal analysis and rheometry and 22% in analytical technologies for bioprocessing. Batra says that as things return to normal 7% annual sales growth is a sustainable target for Waters.",,,,,,,,,,,,

How much credit does Billy Donovan deserve? 10 questions about the ...,"Ten questions about the Chicago Bulls’ hot start heading into Saturday’s rematch against the Philadelphia 76ers at the United Center.

1. It’s not even Thanksgiving yet. Do I have to watch?

Yes you have to watch. This isn’t the Brooklyn Nets with whom you can wait until Kyrie Irving returns to really start paying attention. Every game matters for one of the league’s early surprises.

The Bulls are 6-2 and have two of the NBA’s top scorers in DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine and two sparkplugs in point guards Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso. They’re capable of big second-half comebacks — and of getting into big first-half deficits.

When the Bulls are playing well Ball’s defense has been a key — disrupting deflecting and deflating opponents.

“It’s kind of my job to get everyone in their spots and make sure everyone is comfortable at the same time on both sides of the ball” Ball said. “That’s what I’m trying to do.”

2. Are the Bulls as good as their record?

Bulls guard Ayo Dosunmu (12) celebrates with Nikola Vucevic during the second half against the Celtics on Monday in Boston.

You wouldn’t think so if you heard coach Billy Donovan cite their deficiencies — slow starts spotty ball movement etc. They’ve sneaked away with wins in some games they should’ve lost as Donovan conceded specifically the opener against the Detroit Pistons and the 19-point comeback Monday against the Boston Celtics.

“We’re doing some really really good things” Donovan said. “You’re always looking at and trying to measure where the team can be and how good it can be. I’m not going to sit here and say our record is misleading. That would be unfair to the guys. But I’d say there’s a lot of work we have in front of us.”

Donovan thinks the Bulls can “play faster” and their ceiling can be reached when they get used to each other.

3. Are the Bulls now a Big 2 instead of a Big 3?

The Bulls’ DeMar DeRozan left and Zach LaVine talk during the first quarter against the 76ers on Wednesday at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The 76ers won 103-98.

With DeRozan and LaVine getting the bulk of the scoring opportunities center Nikola Vucevic has been more of a facilitator than a third option. His shooting percentage and points per game have dropped.

Donovan wants his guards to find Vucevic more out on the perimeter to stretch defenses with his 3-point proficiency. Vucevic insists he’s not “sacrificing” his game for the other scorers.

“I think it’s just the way we play” he said. “They have the ball a lot and it’s just they get a lot more opportunities. But there were games where I had shots as well that didn’t fall for me so it’s not necessarily just sacrificing. … I think as a big man that’s usually how it is.”

Vucevic laughed and added: “It’s just the rough life of a big man you know?”

4. Was Billy Donovan ever part of a Big 3 when he starred at Providence under Rick Pitino?

Not according to Donovan.

“Maybe back on the playground back in New York” he said. “Thank God there’s no documentation on that.”

5. How is Zach LaVine’s left thumb?

The same. LaVine’s injury will take some time to heal and he has accepted the fact he’ll play in some pain. LaVine won’t make excuses and still is performing at a very high level.

While it’s not his shooting hand LaVine has shot 24% on 3-pointers over the last four games since suffering torn ligaments in the thumb Oct. 25 in Toronto. Last year he shot 42% on 3s.

With DeRozan in the house at least LaVine no longer has to carry the load.

6. When will Coby White return from left shoulder surgery?

White participated in light-contact shooting drills at practice Friday but Donovan said “I don’t know how close he is” to being cleared for a practice. The Bulls miss White more than some fans realize. Even as Ball replaced him at the point and Alex Caruso is the backup White can provide instant offense off the bench when he’s on one of his hot streaks.

7. How much credit does Billy Donovan deserve for the early success?

Bulls coach Billy Donovan walks near the bench during the first half of a game against the Knicks on Oct. 28 at the United Center.

Having better starters is the main reason but Donovan has done a great job of deciding when to play or sit Ayo Dosunmu Tony Bradley and Derrick Jones Jr. three valuable reserves. And frequently keeping DeRozan in with the second unit has helped alleviate pressure on the bench to score when LaVine Vucevic and Ball are out. It’s also hard to imagine a Jim Boylen-coached team coming back from 19- and 18-point deficits in back-to-back games.

8. Are centers extinct as some analytics suggest?

“Don’t start with me on analytical things” Vucevic told a reporter. “I think it’s stupid.”

He pointed to Giannis Antetokounmpo winning the NBA MVP and Nikola Jokic Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis as three other examples of great modern-day centers.

“We just play differently” Vucevic said. “Now you have more bigs than ever that can pass the ball more bigs that can shoot the 3 that can space the floor. So it’s just different the way that we’ve been utilized. (By) no means (are centers extinct). I mean Jokic he’s maybe the best player in the league with Embiid.”

9. Why does Alex Caruso wear a headband when he’s bald?

Bulls guard Alex Caruso celebrates after hitting a shot in the second half of a game against the Pistons on Oct. 23 at the United Center.

Caruso was nicknamed the “Bald Mamba” when he played with the Los Angeles Lakers. He said he shaves his head for fashionable and altruistic reasons.

“It’s definitely thin but I could get some hair going if I needed to” Caruso said. “I had hair a mustache chin hair all of that.”

Caruso said he has a partnership with Manscaped in which he’s paid by the grooming-product company to shave his head with the money going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

“It was a little bit of both (charitable and personal) reasons” he said. “Mutually beneficial.”

10. Will hot sauce be served Saturday?

Only if Bulls TV analyst Stacey King remembers to bring it.

Posted on 11/07/2021

The Duchossois Group Inc. sold The Chamberlain Group LLC a company involved with making garage door openers and other door openers for residential and commercial properties to private equity funds managed by Blackstone Group. Blackstone is investing in Chamberlain Group through its core private equity strategy which invests in companies for longer periods than traditional private equity. Chamberlain Group continues as a privately held company headquartered in Oak Brook Illinois. The Duchossois Group continues to hold meaningful equity ownership in Chamberlain Group and will fill two seats of the company’s future Board of Directors. The deal was signed on September 7 2021 but closed recently. The transaction values Chamberlain Group at approximately US$ 5 billion.

The Chamberlain Group owns products such as the LiftMaster a brand of professionally-installed residential garage door systems and commercial door operators.

The investment from Blackstone positions Chamberlain Group with greater resources and expertise to scale its software-based and connected services business into new markets. Chamberlain Group expects to reach a broader base of global customers as the Company accesses Blackstone’s extensive network and expands its software services strategy deeper into commercial industrial and automotive markets.

Chamberlain Group has been an important part of Duchossois Group since 1980.

He's a crypto investor and fast-growing influencer with almost 900000 followers on TikTok alone.

He's also a 12-year banking veteran with his most recent title being vice president district manager at Wells Fargo. In 2017 he left that job to become an entrepreneur by starting his own business as a crypto coach.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Now he's busy educating his followers on how to take advantage of a rapidly moving and volatile market. He's especially focused on navigating his audience through the last quarter of 2021 which he says is on track to feature a parabolic bull run.

Seasoned crypto investors generally follow a four-year cycle tied to bitcoin's halving when mining rewards are lessened. And historical patterns — notably the huge gains in 2017 — suggest the last quarter of the fourth year is the grand finale where everything peaks to all-time highs before a drop-off.

Bitcoin tends to lead this rally while altcoins trail behind. On October 20 bitcoin surpassed its all-time high reaching almost $67000. Since then it's been hovering in the low $60000s. Investors are now watching and waiting for its next rally.

Outside of historical patterns Vasquez notes that there's something new about this cycle and it has to do with mass adoption on a level never before seen. And no it's not exclusively the recently launched bitcoin futures ETFs or institutional investors' participation that he's referring to.

Major fast-food chains like Burger King and McDonald's have announced that they're jumping on the crypto bandwagon. Burger King is offering its customers rewards in crypto and Mcdonald's is giving away non-fungible tokens. Vasquez believes this is going to open the floodgates for more individuals to start using crypto.

Even amidst all the excitement he reminds investors that they should never invest more than they can afford to lose. Crypto remains heavily speculative and so the risks are high.

But on a good note you don't need to put very much into crypto to see decent gains he said. If you have extra cash to spare or if you could earn some extra income to put into crypto that's enough and it could potentially change your life he added.

His latest top picks for the coming bull run

Without a doubt his top pick is XRP. Vasquez believes the crypto's price is going to explode when Ripple's ongoing lawsuit with the SEC ends. XRP was pulled off of some major exchanges in December of 2020 because of the ongoing issue and this has held its price down.

""When this case gets dropped or settled it's going to be the biggest crypto news in history. And so what happens when crypto news hits everybody's going to come FOMOing fear of missing out into XRP and the price is going to skyrocket"" Vasquez said.

In a previous interview with Insider mid-September Vasquez said he was bullish on XRP. Since then the crypto is up by about 9.4%. XRP was last trading around $1.16 as of Friday according to CoinMarketCap.

The second crypto he recommends new investors focus on is Vechain which uses the crypto vet. This is a blockchain developed to support supply-chain management and business processes.

Vasquez believes the solutions it brings are important right now especially because of the supply-chain issues that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vasquez also touted vet in his previous interview. It's since up by about 45%. As of Friday vet was trading around $0.16 according to CoinMarketCap.

The next altcoin he's very bullish on is cro which belongs to Crypto.com an exchange platform that offers a wide variety of crypto. It solves a big issue which is the barrier to entry because its app is very user-friendly. New investors can buy stake and trade crypto that isn't always available on other mainstream platforms.

Even his mother who still writes checks is able to easily use the app to buy and transfer the cryptos she wants to invest in he said.

He adds that the company also has an impressive marketing strategy. They advertise on various platforms including TikTok and sports events. They recently even hired Matt Damon for their new ad campaign.

CRO hit a record high of $0.40 on Friday after its listing on Coinbase.

On the gaming side he says investors should have their eye on mana the native currency of a leading metaverse called Decentraland. The sector has recently exploded with attention after Facebook announced it was rebranding itself to Meta.

Mana was last trading around $2.54 as of Thursday according to CoinMarketCap. Many cryptos tied to metaverse projects have recently seen huge pumps due to Facebook's announcement and may correct but they remain good long-term holds he said.

Another pick is enj also in the gaming sector. It belongs to Enjin a platform that backs NFTs and can be used in games.

As of Thursday it was trading around $2.99 according to CoinMarketCap.

And finally he's a huge fan of ether and often puts his crypto profits into buying more of it. He touted it in mid-September since then it's up by about 34%.

These six altcoins give investors exposure to utility-based cryptos in various sectors including banking enterprise and supply chain management a crypto exchange the metaverse and gaming.

However Vasquez reminds investors that the end of the bull run usually means a drop of up to 90% in some of these altcoins. It's important to have an exit strategy or be invested in strong projects that you're ready to hold long-term. If you can do both that's even better he adds. Vasquez plans on exiting 50% of his positions during the bull run and leaving the remainder in strong projects."

In fact Welltower posted the strongest sequential revenue growth in the company’s history last quarter with rate and occupancy increases resulting in a 3.5% rise in same-store topline revenue.

“Despite mediocre bottom-line results we cannot be happier with the overall results of the quarter” CEO Shankh Mitra said Friday on the Toledo Ohio-based company’s Q3 2021 earnings call.

Looking ahead Mitra is even more bullish seeing signs that labor challenges are easing and the overall operating environment is improving which bodes well for the REIT’s longer-term financial performance. Welltower plans to achieve additional gains through an effort led by recently named COO John Burkart to “modernize” operations.

“It is my firm belief that our margin will be higher than the pre-Covid margin on a stabilized basis” Mitra said referring to Welltower’s senior housing operating partners.

However Mitra also cautioned that senior living operators across the industry continue to face a difficult and uncertain operating environment and while strong operators have opportunities to expand with partners like Welltower weaker businesses could fail.

Welltower’s leaders also are excited about maximizing the upside of new investments including four senior living portfolios that the company recently acquired for $1.3 billion. The REIT has a strong pipeline of additional senior housing opportunities and Mitra foresees that the current aggressive investment period will last even longer than he initially anticipated.

Welltower already is the largest senior housing owner in the United States with more than 780 properties in its senior housing operating (SHO) portfolio and about 350 in its triple-net portfolio.

Expense and revenue tug-of-war

The senior living expense stack was hit by “a perfect storm” in Q3 Mitra said on Friday’s call.

The “confluence of extraordinary costs” included rising expenses in labor insurance utility repair and maintenance and other areas he said.

Labor headwinds have been particularly forceful across the U.S. economy as workers left their jobs in droves over the summer while wages have been spiking and labor unrest has been building.

Within senior living additional labor complications arose. As the delta variant caused a surge in Covid-19 infections outside of senior living communities workers more frequently called in sick — either because they tested positive or out of caution if they were even mildly ill Mitra said. And senior living staff were logging more paid time off than usual eager to take advantage of easing travel restrictions after more than a year of exhausting work.

Consequently many senior living providers turned to agency labor which costs two to three times as much Mitra noted.

“We have seen some operators where contract labor cost has gone up 10x in six months” he said.

The rise in contract labor resulted in a $9 million SHO impact in the quarter Welltower noted in its earnings release. The SHO margin dropped 50 basis points sequentially to 21%.

But while expenses were a severe drag topline performance was strong thanks to the “dual benefit” of occupancy and rate growth Mitra said.

SHO same-store revenue increased 3.5% sequentially; and for the U.S. and U.K. portfolios year-over-year revenue growth turned positive for the first time since the pandemic started.

In the U.S. SHO portfolio occupancy growth was “solid” increasing 260 basis points sequentially BMO Capital Markets analysts noted. Overall SHO portfolio spot occupancy increased about 210 basis points sequentially to 76.7%.

Consumers recognized that high resident and staff vaccination rates made senior living communities safe havens driving demand even in the midst of the delta surge Mitra said.

Source: https://welltower.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21-Business-Update-vFINAL.pdf

Furthermore the rise in single-family home values and the strong performance of the stock market are providing older adults with the purchasing power for a senior living move even in the midst of an inflationary environment. And in light of the pandemic consumers also are more focused on the quality of care and services and shopping less on price Mitra said.

Welltower’s senior living operators are therefore aggressively increasing rates. They are in the process of enacting annual bumps for in-place residents but they are also touting the strength of their service offerings to drive rates for new residents and the “street” rate is generally moving up 1.5x to 2x faster than the “renewal” rate Mitra said.

The full benefit of rate increases has not yet been realized as the renewal rates typically take effect after the first of the year. So Welltower’s leaders are anticipating further momentum in the first quarter of 2022.

Storm gives way to green shoots

Mitra and other Welltower execs are not only optimistic about rate growth but are hopeful that the labor crunch is easing as enhanced unemployment benefits have been phased out the latest Covid-19 surge is dissipating and in-person school has resumed.

“Although I expect we will still see some continued pressure for several months I’m hearing green shoots as our operators are making comments such as ‘the peak labor challenge has passed’ or ‘we’ve seen a substantial pickup in applications’ or ‘new hires outnumber the employees leaving 2.5 to one’ and even ‘we’re currently fully staffed at almost all of our communities’” Burkart said.

Demand also remains “unprecedented” judging by October and early November sales trends.

“We have never seen this kind of momentum that’s all I’m willing to say” Mitra commented.

Mitra and Burkart are planning to build on these tailwinds by pursuing operational innovations. Burkart joined Welltower as COO in June 2021 coming from multifamily REIT Essex Property Trust (NYSE: ESS).

“While the focus on care has been and continues to be very high I believe that similar to the multifamily industry 20 to 30 years ago there [is] an opportunity to modernize our seniors housing business and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations” he said.

Though tight-lipped about his plans he identified targeted community renovations digital transformation and revenue management as areas of focus.

As one example he described leveraging Welltower’s data analytics to evaluate how a market has priced certain types of units over time. Applying this approach to one highrise property revealed “substantial variations in demand versus pricing” that is leading Welltower to change prices on certain units by as much as $1000 a month.

While encouraged by the appearance of green shoots Mitra also stressed that “we don’t know what is going to happen in the holiday season” with regard to labor and the overall operating environment remains taxing.

As a result he anticipates further industry consolidation of operators as winners are sorted from losers. Welltower expects to keep diversifying its roster of operators and expanding its relationships with “winners.” As an example Mitra cited StoryPoint.

Following the pre-pandemic disposition of 13 buildings at “an incredible price” Welltower counted only two StoryPoint communities in its portfolio. Over the last 18 months that number has grown to 50-plus communities.

“The market share of great operators is changing” Mitra said.

Torrid dealmaking pace continues

In conjunction with its earnings release Welltower announced acquisitions of four senior living portfolios representing a pro rata investment of $1.3 billion. These are just the latest transactions in a remarkably acquisitive period for the REIT.

With marquee deals such as the $1.6 billion purchase of 86 Atria Senior Living/Holiday Retirement properties Welltower has completed $5.6 billion in gross investments since October 2020.

Mitra elaborated on some of the latest senior housing additions during Friday’s call.

One deal involved 14 communities operated by Tucson Arizona-based Watermark Retirement. Welltower anticipates achieving a double-digit unlevered internal rate of return (IRR) on this deal by executing a “higher and better use strategy” Mitra said.

In other words these communities are located in desirable micromarkets and present opportunities for strategic expansion or repositioning. For example one community in the Bellevue Washington area includes a piece of residential-zoned land where Welltower could develop a vertical senior living or wellness-focused property; or the REIT could sell the land to a multifamily developer.

Such a real estate value-add strategy is enabled by the addition of Burkart and the hire of Mike Ferry as SVP and head of global development. These leaders and their teams have brought the needed expertise to Welltower which has struggled in the past to execute on these types of opportunities Mitra said.

Another of the new acquisitions involves five communities in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast with an average age of three years. Mitra said that Welltower will in the future disclose the identity of the “extraordinary” operator and developer of the communities.

“Here is a teaser — this team has executed flawlessly even during this challenging Q3 without any agency labor. That gives you a sense of their operating prowess” he said.

Dealmaking at the moment is largely being driven by sellers coming up on debt maturities so they prize the certainty of a close highly Mitra said noting that Welltower can execute these types of deals with speed and certainty thanks largely to its data analytics capabilities and the company’s roster of high-quality operators.

The third-quarter labor challenges have caused a significant number of owners to seek an exit from senior housing continuing the churn that began during the pandemic according to Mitra. The conditions continue to be ripe for Welltower to execute on its investment strategy of acquiring in the right micro-markets with the right operators and at the right discount to replacement cost.

“I remain very optimistic that this trend of acquisition at these kinds of prices will continue — frankly longer than I thought” Mitra said.

And Welltower certainly has the dry powder to keep executing deals as Stifel analysts noted.

“With $303 million of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet $4.0 billion of availability liquidity (WELL just expanded credit facility) and no material senior unsecured note maturities until 2024 WELL’s liquidity position is very strong. We assume that the cash will be redeployed into acquisitions over the next year or two” they wrote.

Mitra’s optimism in the midst of current challenges seemed to resonate with investors on Friday as the REIT’s share price climbed 5.32% to end the day at $84.64.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s two new exhibitions in as many days for Rankin as a new show by the celebrated photographer and film-maker opened on Thursday in Fujifilm’s The House of Photography.

‘Performance by Rankin’ is a free exhibition that celebrates the return of live theatre and musicals to London’s West End after the industry was laid low by Covid-19 lockdowns for well over one year.

Rankin joined forces with the Mayor of London’s #LetsDoLondon campaign and the Society of London Theatre (SoLT) as part of its #BackOnStage campaign.

The aim of the project was to celebrate the talent and resilience of the front and back stage crew of London’s theatres – “the cultural heart of the city.”

Over five full days of shooting the photographer invited 150 individuals from almost 60 of London’s top shows and venues to sit for him in a pop-up studio at the House of Photography.

The resulting pictures were printed on Fujifilm paper and mounted on the walls of the first-floor gallery gradually filling up the available space.

On the day of our visit Rankin said that a blank wall that covered with printed quotes from participating shows would be replaced by new photos by the end of the following day.

And for anyone not used to having their picture taken by a top professional it would have been reassuring when they were invited to choose their ’keeper’ image from the two or three variations that Rankin shot of each sitter; as his camera was tethered to a computer his models were able to get instant sight of the captures.

Rankin said he wasn’t aiming to capture the actors and performers as they would appear in their shows but instead wanted them to project the joy of being able to tread the boards once again to live audiences in London’s Theatreland.

“I felt the loss of theatre because it was emblematic of the wider creative world shutting down and the isolation we all felt"" said Rankin. “It was the loss of the performance we all collaborate in every day.

“Taking pictures for this new project the joy that every single subject brought to the sessions was like breath of fresh air – rejuvenating my energy for what I do as well as giving everyone a chance to perform again albeit just for my camera.”

David Harewood was the most recognisable face during Digital Camera World’s visit but other well-known sitters beaming down from the gallery walls included Rory Kinnear and Paul Whitehouse impresarios Cameron Mackintosh Sonia Friedman and Andrew Lloyd Webber – and many more.

‘Performance by Rankin‘ is open now until 31 January 2022 at the Fujifilm House of Photography 8-9 Long Acre London WC2E 9LH.

Entry is free but visitors are encouraged to donate on site to the Theatre Artists Fund which provides emergency aid to struggling theatre freelancers as well as to four London youth homelessness charities selected by the Mayor of London: Depaul  akt  Centrepoint and New Horizons Youth Centre .

A limited edition 120-page ‘Performance by Rankin’ hardback book of the portraits will be launched on 25 November to accompany the exhibition and all proceeds will go to the project’s chosen charities.

The portraits will then be exhibited across multiple venues across central London and on train platforms across the south-east of England. More details will be announced soon.

THE granddaughter of a man murdered during the 1972 Springhill-Westrock Massacre which is set for a fresh inquest has vowed to resist the British Government's amnesty proposals.

On July 9 1972 five innocent people – including three teenagers – were shot dead by the British Army between the Springhill and Westrock estates in West Belfast.

The deaths of Margaret Gargan (13) John Dougal (16) David McCafferty (15) father-of-six Patrick Butler (38) and local parish priest Fr Noel Fitzpatrick (42) were never properly investigated. Despite evidence of their innocence including eyewitness accounts of the events an inquest held at the time returned an open verdict.

New inquests into the killings were directed by the then Attorney General John Larkin back in 2014. Earlier this year the families had their case listed for a pre-inquest hearing which is expected in the next 12 to 18 months. However British Government proposals to introduce a statute of limitations on Troubles killings and crimes prior to 1998 has cast doubt over the case.

Natasha Butler whose grandfather Patrick Butler was amongst those shot dead said: ""We're currently waiting on a pre-inquest date but with these (British government) proposals we're unsure where our case is.

""If these proposals are introduced Boris Johnson will close down all legacy inquests so that will close down all our access to truth and accountability.

""Even though he does plan to propose them the families of Springhill and Westrock plan to keep fighting.

""For 49 years we've been waiting for some sort of recognition of the events of the 9th of July. To close that down is very very hurtful.

Ms Butler said there was ""never"" a proper police investigation with soldiers' accounts of events ""taken for gospel"".

She said the families of the victims were not legally represented during the investigation.

""This new inquest would be the first time that all the evidence would be looked at and cross-examined"" she said.

""As we seen with the Ballymurphy inquest the legacy process through inquest does work it does get to the truth and it does get recognition that excess force was used by the army. That's what we want. We want our loved ones' names cleared and vindicated. We want an apology for what the British army did in 1972 because it was wrong.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

History

The Logging Era

Camp 75



In 1905 Edward Hines and the Weyerhaeuser family pooled their resources to create the Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company. The flag ship of the company was its sawmill in Virginia Minnesota which could process one million board feet of lumber a day.



To transport logs to the sawmill before the days of modern logging technology logs had to be floated down rivers and winched across lakes in giant booms by amphibious boats called gators. Hoist Bay home of the Virginia and Rainy Lake Logging Camp 75 was one of these destinations.



At Hoist Bay a hoist machine lifted the logs out of the water and placed them on empty train cars for transportation. Pictured below is the railroad trestle and hoist built across the water. The train then transported the logs to Virginia Minnesota to be cut into boards.



Between 1913 and 1929 the camp in Hoist Bay operated for 16 years. In its lifetime 13.5 million board feet of lumber entered its waters. By 1929 most of the white and red pine stands were cut; Camp 75 was shut down and dismantled ending one part of the Hoist Bay story.



The Recreation Era

Monson's Resort



The Hoist Bay area lay dormant for almost 10 years changing ownership 50 times until 1939 when Ted and Fern Monson purchased the land starting a new chapter in its history.



When the Monsons arrived there were few reminders of the previous logging era. The only remnants included the railroad trestle an old root cellar and a garbage dump.



Between 1939 and 1945 the Monsons built 4 cabins; each cabin had 4 bedrooms a kitchen and a living room. Modern amenities such as indoor bathrooms and electricity were added in the 1950s.



In all the Monsons built 14 buildings that were enjoyed by summer visitors and they catered to their guests’ needs for 35 years only closing for 3 years during World War 2.



Ted and Fern decided to sell the resort in 1973 and in 1978 the Hoist Bay land was acquired by the National Park Service. It was designated a point of interest for visitors and a new chapter in the history of Hoist Bay began.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Stenciled on one of the T-shirts was in all caps BIG CHEETAH 24 — the Tech linebacker's nickname and uniform number. The other fan's T-shirt bore a large facial image of Morgenstern what an artist might sketch from a head shot of the big senior from New York.

To the extent a viewer might have given it any thought he probably didn't think of this: Morgenstern gets a small commission from sales of those shirts ones produced and marketed by an Austin-based company with whom Morgenstern connected once state legislatures and the NCAA gave their OK this summer for college athletes to profit off their name image and likeness.

Before he transferred last year to Tech Morgenstern used to choose that very subject for some of his class assignments.

""I wrote a few papers about it when I was an undergrad at Duke University"" he said ""so I definitely had strong feelings for it. I'm glad that student-athletes are able to finally profit off their name image and likeness because they do bring so much value. I felt like they were unduly impeded from accessing the market being able to capitalize on their NIL. So I think it's really great that they're able to do that.""

On July 1 college sports entered a new era with its athletes able to make money off endorsements autographs public appearances giving lessons and creating content among other endeavors. Newly enacted laws in about half the states paved the way and the NCAA opted to stand down rather than try to punish players engaging in NIL activity.

Athletes may reach out to businesses and vice versa. A university's athletics department may not broker deals but an athlete is required to disclose to the school NIL-related opportunities he or she is considering.

Texas Tech's numbers

Tech senior associate athletics director Amy Heard said recently her office had received about 140 such disclosures from about 80 Tech athletes at least one from 11 of its teams. Most have come from football men's basketball baseball and soccer players.

Of the 80 athletes Heard said 35 are football players. The number of NIL opportunities presented to Tech athletes and the number of athletes receiving such opportunities she said is higher because not all athletes are taking deals they're offered.

Colin Schooler signed in early August with the Radegen sports and entertainment agency less for what it can do for him now than in the future.

""I'm not necessarily using it as a way to make a quick buck here and there"" the Red Raiders' linebacker said. ""I'm more using it as a building block to start a foundation of what can come.

""As a team we've kind of come to a consensus that winning is the most important thing here and the more you win the more opportunities there will be for NIL.

""And it's a gift and a curse the way you look at it. Players can get more caught up in the NIL than football so I feel like especially when we have 18-year-old kids living by themselves for the first time it can be tempting to only focus on that.""

Schooler says he's ""kind of waiting"" before jumping into an NIL deal.

""More building a foundation building connections and learning the way how it goes"" he said ""rather than going out and signing something quick that I don't know much about.""

Rustic Furniture Warehouse in Lubbock has run commercials on local television throughout this season featuring the Red Raiders' Erik Ezukanma who went into this weekend third in the Big 12 in catches and second in receiving yards.

During a session with the media this past week Ezukanma wore a stocking cap bearing his personal logo: his EE initials offset in stairstep fashion and separated by a lightning bolt. A marketing company helped the Tech wide receiver with the branding and authorization completing the process in the past couple of weeks.

There's now a website up and running erikezukanma.co that advertises T-shirts jerseys sweaters hoodies caps beanies joggers and shorts bearing his logo. As is the case with the apparel that bears Morgenstern's likenesses Ezukanma can legally earn a commission from sales off his website.

Senior cornerback Adrian Frye said before the season started he wouldn't mind doing what he could to help out a small business but he had not spent much time pursuing NIL opportunities.

""I just feel like if the time comes where somebody wants to use me to promote their brand and things like that then I'll respond. I'll accept it"" Frye said. ""I haven't really been reaching out very much. I reached out to one or two companies but they're mainly like my friends' companies.""

Tech quarterback Tyler Shough has missed the past five games with a broken collarbone but the transfer from Oregon was one of the first Red Raiders given multiple NIL offers to sort through. His appeal for promotional purposes was plain to see: He arrived at Tech this spring having already been a power-five conference starter for Oregon not to mention being 6-foot-5 and with pro potential.

More:Will athletes' new college cash flow impact team chemistry?

Shough said in August he has done NIL activity locally with 1000 Degrees Pizza and Cardinal's Sport Center also with the Raising Cane's chicken fingers chain restaurant and ""some trading-card stuff nationally."" He also looped in his offensive linemen to be able to receive complementary meals on another agreement.

Like Schooler Shough said he believes more in what he can earn in the future than in the short-term.

""Also within the locker room I've been doing everything I can to spread the wealth"" Shough said before the season. ""And I really haven't been doing that much compared to a lot of other quarterbacks around the nation who have signed marketing agents.""

Heard said disclosed compensation to Tech athletes with NIL agreements indicates merchandise discounts codes and traditional cash compensation.

A little less than 38% of the disclosures involve social media with nearly 20% being disclosed as an endorsement.

""It'll be interesting"" Heard said. ""I think it's going to continue to keep growing. I think students are going to get more active. Businesses are going to continue to get engaged.""

Unintended consequences

Those opposed to college athletes profiting from NIL suggest it will lead to dissension and jealousy in the locker room. Tech players had mixed opinions on that.

""Everyone understands they're not going to get the same opportunities"" center Dawson Deaton said. ""Like me as a center I'm not going to get the same deals as Tyler our quarterback and Henry (Colombi) and those guys. I understand that and I think everyone on the team has done a good job of being together in that aspect.""

Early on Deaton agreed to do social-media promotions for The WagBar an American Wagyu beef snack and for Roundhill Investments a New York-based firm.

Frye said the potential for locker-room issues is present ""but I feel like that's for guys that don't really have that bond and really aren't close with each other.

""I mean Tyler Shough just got here and he has name image likeness opportunities where I'm not jealous of him. I'm really happy for him because that gives him a chance to promote his brand make his name have a statement and then on top of that he gets to help companies benefit as well.

""I'm not a guy to hate on somebody's else's upbringing and stuff like that. You've got to be a negative person to let that affect you.""

Morgenstern said he can understand the contention among those opposed to NIL ""but at the end of the day"" he said ""I believe you're worth your market value.

""And if you're going to say that about football specifically then you can say that in the work environment. Why are people paid differently? It's what's your value what do you bring what do companies want to get from you and what value can you extract from them?""

One player's experience

Jacob Morgenstern and a classmate during his days at Duke once did a 20-page paper single-spaced on the NCAA. They researched the concept of amateurism and how the NCAA adhered to it especially under Walter Byers the sanctioning body's first executive director who served from 1951 to 1988.

""It seemed wrong to me that student-athletes were able to be stripped of their intellectual property rights and to be able to make a living simply because the NCAA said so"" Morgenstern said. ""They were making something that was not illegal illegal to student-athletes specifically.

""If you apply that to any other market you can't do that. You can't tell an amateur actor that they can't go and give acting lessons to make some money but for some reason student-athletes had those right stripped from them. So I was very passionate about that.""

Lo and behold the loosening of the restrictions took place before Morgenstern's college career ended.

The T-shirts bearing Morgenstern's nickname and likeness are done by Last Stand Hats based in Austin. He's one of 17 athletes — others are from Texas Stephen F. Austin and Texas State — whose apparel with catchy designs is advertised on the company's website.

Morgenstern had two NIL opportunities rejected. Both were from beverage companies with whom he could not engage because their products would be considered competitors and in conflict with Texas Tech's contract with Coca-Cola.

""I think we're still working through a lot of the kinks"" Morgenstern said. ""Some offers that I've had have been rejected through compliance because of nuances and technical (considerations) I guess things with the state of Texas and whatnot.

""Hopefully we'll be able to have greater access to a full market in the near future. But I do ultimately think it's a good thing that the ball got rolling and student-athletes can access the market.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWtvcy5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLzExLzYvMjA2MjM5NC8tUmVjZW50bHktUmV2ZWFsZWQtU3RpcHVsYXRpb24tSW4tQWxsLU9mLVJvYmluLVdpbGxpYW0tcy1Db250cmFjdHMtSnVzdC1NZWFucy1XZS1NaXNzLUhpbS1FdmVuLU1vcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recently Revealed Stipulation In All Of Robin Williams' Contracts Just Means We Miss Him Even More.,"We are weary of those that are self-absorbed to the point of throwing tantrums if their outrageous demands and extreme requests aren’t met.

Brian Lord who is the senior V.P. at Premiere Speakers Bureau has seen them all.

Until he contacted Robin William’s team inquiring about his availability for an event.

The reply came back with terms and one ‘rider’ the part of the contract agreement where a performer stipulates any extra demands that they require be it the food trailer size backstage conditions what have you.

That demand?

Wrote Brian “When I got Robin Williams’ rider I was very surprised by what I found. He actually had a requirement that for every single event or film he did the company hiring him also had to hire a certain number of homeless people and put them to work.

I never watched a Robin Williams movie the same way after that. I’m sure that on his own time and with his own money he was working with these people in need but he’d also decided to use his clout as an entertainer to make sure that production companies and event planners also learned the value of giving people a chance to work their way back.“

Ever since Moscow on the Hudson in 1984 that rider was included.

And that all the homeless of a given locale would be fed so bring an extra commissary truck.

Oh and bring vouchers to local motels so they can get rest before they appear on set.

His acts of kindness and giving back defined the man.

- He and good friends Billy Crystal And Whoopi hosted Comic Relief from it’s inception.

Comic Relief’s mission is to raise funds to help those in need….particularly America’s homeless. Raising over $100 million to providing assistance and health care service to homeless people and to raise awareness of not only the awful realities but also how many ""ordinary"" people can wind up or grow up homeless.

On fire!

- He spent more time overseas with our troops over the decades than near any other performer in history rivaling Bob Hope.

Six USO tours in sixteen countries including wartime Iraq and Afghanistan.

He understood what those that witnessed horror needed most…..understanding and humour.

2007 Camp Arifjan in Kuwait —

- His best friend was Christopher Reeve.

They first met when they were youngsters at Juilliard.

Said Robin “Chris was literally feeding me because I don’t think I literally had money for food or my student loan hadn’t come in yet and he would share his food with me.”

After the equestrian accident that left Chris a quadriplegic he was sinking into deep despair.

Robin was there daily.

Remembered Chris “At an especially bleak moment the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses speaking in a Russian accent. He announced that he was my proctologist and that he had to examine me immediately…it was Robin Williams…for the first time since the accident I laughed. My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay.”

Robin made it clear that the Reeve's shouldn't unduly concern themselves with finances.... and he founded a scholarship program at Juilliard for those in need.

- At the time of the making of Schindler’s List Robin would call up Steven Spielberg in the evening to lift his spirits and make him laugh.

- Robin was in the final running for the lead role in The Shining but Stanley Kubrick rejected the idea because Robin was “too psychotic.”

Which considering this…..

- During his sole audition for the role of Mork ever kinetic Robin couldn’t sit down and was moving all over the room.

Garry Marshall asked him to please sit down.

So Robin sat on his head.

Garry hired him on the spot. “He was the only alien who auditioned.”

- Robin was the first male cheerleader in NFL history when in 1979 he was a cheerleader for the entire second half for the Denver Broncos.

But halfway through......

(As an aside: The Broncos routed the Patriots 45-10).

- His most special moments?

His bond with Koko.

Back in 2001 Williams visited the Gorilla Foundation in California and met with Koko a gorilla who uses American Sign Language to communicate. During their encounter Williams and Koko laughed tickled each other and hugged like old friends. On Monday Koko overheard Dr. Penny Patterson her mentor and surrogate mother talking on the phone about Williams’ death. “She became extremely sad” Patterson wrote on Koko.org. “Robin’s ability to just ‘hang out’ with Koko a gorilla and in minutes become one of her closest friends was extraordinary and unforgettable” Patterson continued in a tribute post to Williams who was an ambassador for Great Ape conservation. “I recently had a mind-altering experience communicating with a gorilla” Williams said in the video. “We shared something extraordinary: Laughter. Koko understands spoken English and uses over 1000 signs to share her feelings and thoughts about daily events life love even death. It was awesome and unforgettable.” “Notice that Robin made Koko smile — something she hadn’t done for over six months ever since her childhood gorilla companion Michael passed away at the age of 27” Patterson wrote. “But not only did Robin cheer up Koko the effect was mutual and Robin seemed transformed.”

- Robin was heavily involved with both St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and The Make-A-Wish Foundation which itself was heavily involved in the filming of Patch Adams.

To try and understand the massive yet gentle heart of Patch and to expand their own Robin and the entire cast would spend time with very ill children.

These children would end up in the film as the kids Patch interacts with in the pediatric scenes.

- His favorite book as an adult was the Isaac Asimov’s Foundation Series.

""It's one of the greatest books of all time and the greatest character is The Mule.""

As a child it was Chronicles of Narnia's The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe.

""I would read the whole C.S. Lewis series out loud to my kids. I was once reading to Zelda and she said 'don't do any voices. Just read it as yourself.' So I did I just read it straight and she said 'that's better.'""

-His favorite role was with Robert DeNiro in Awakenings.

""I think playing Oliver Sachs in Awakenings was a gift because I got to meet him and got to explore the human brain from the inside out. Because Oliver writes about human behavior subjectively and that for me was the beginning of a fascination with human behavior.""

-His favorite hobby was cycling.

""My favorite thing to do is ride a bicycle. I ride road bikes. And for me it's mobile meditation.""

- He learned to cook really well by visiting Martha Stewart at home and they formed a tight bond.

And he was a frequent guest on her show.

Martha knew full well that by telling Robin to ""rub it into the meat"" she was letting him loose and setting the stage for comedy heaven.

- Robin waking up an unsuspecting space shuttle crew in 1988 from NASA Ground Control.

I could gladly go on in this vein all afternoon with dramatic clips of Robin from the Fisher King Dead Poets Society Good Will Hunting Moscow On The Hudson What Dreams May Come Good Morning Vietnam etc etc etc or recalling the countless instances of kindness to ordinary folk humble and without airs never refusing a picture or being too much in a hurry to listen to share and commiserate or the backstories behind all the benefits and charities and scholarships he founded…... but we all have terribly depressing current events and despicable people to revile….. so i’ll end with this one clip.

It was the only copy of it i could find and this copy is rough.

But with a wasted Jack Nicholson it defines Robin for me.

A tie with three people and Robin lost.

So so funny.

Enough to have a usually stoic Daniel Day- Lewis bent over.

But even more it shows just how beloved and treasured he was by his peers.

Someone who could transcend politics and have those that never met him feel like they lost a dear dear friend.

Seven years now.

When i think of Robin i smile.... often accompanied by tears.

What a gift.

Thank you all for indulging my meandering whimsy.

Enjoy.

It doesn’t get any better.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMjQuY29tL25ld3MyNC9zb3V0aGFmcmljYS9uZXdzL3doaXN0bGVibG93ZXItYXRob2wtd2lsbGlhbXMtZmxlZXMtY291bnRyeS1mZWFyaW5nLWZvci1oaXMtbGlmZS1jaXRlcy1iYWJpdGEtZGVva2FyYW4tYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbi0yMDIxMTEwN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Whistleblower Athol Williams flees country fearing for his life cites Babita Deokaran assassination,"Former UCT ethics lecturer Athol Williams has fled the country.

He left the country following concerns over his safety.

Williams blew the whistle on companies and individuals involved in state capture and testified before the Zondo Commission.

Former University of Cape Town (UCT) ethics lecturer Athol Williams says he's been forced to leave the country over fears for his safety after he blew the whistle on companies and individuals involved in state capture.

In a statement Williams confirmed that he had left the country on 1 November.

Rather than diminish after I testified these concerns increased while the prospect of prosecutions grew. After Babita Deokaran was assassinated concerns spiked because it showed that authorities were choosing not to proactively protect whistleblowers.

""Knowing that my government offers me no protection after I've acted in the public interest is a disturbing reality. I implicated 39 parties in my testimony so threats could come from many places. After receiving warnings from trusted allies and a civil society organisation about a coordinated effort against me I took the sad step to leave home again without any help.""

Williams added that he had spoken up continuously about injustices in South Africa and taken action where he could.

However rather than support him he claimed that he faced alienation and abandonment by corporate South Africa where he served for many years from the university where he taught ethics and from government; and that he'd also been let down by friends.

In June Williams alleged that UCT offered him money in the hopes that he would stop asking whether it used companies caught up in state capture allegations.

However UCT denied the claims saying that Williams was distorting facts and that it had tried its best to accommodate his concerns.

Williams said: ""It's a tragedy that those who choose to do the right thing have their lives shattered while everyone looks on. We all need to act to fix this tragedy.""

He added that South African companies and government at local provincial and national level had let down whistleblowers and witnesses.

""They have let down all South Africans preferring empty statements and platitudes over sincerity and authenticity.

But Parise said he's ""moved on"" from the Wild's decision to buy out his contract.

""It's been a long time"" Parise said recently during a Zoom call with reporters ahead of his first game against his former team since that split. ""I love where I'm at. We've got a great hockey team here. It's a really fun group of players to be around and that's just made the transition that much easier.""

After being let go by the Wild in July — the team bought out Parise and Ryan Suter when both had four season to go on their matching 13-year $98 million contracts — Parise signed a one-year contract with the Islanders.

The 37-year-old picked up his first points with his new squad on Thursday assisting on two goals in a lopsided win at Montreal and has filled out a bottom-six line with Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Oliver Wahlstrom.

""Zach is pretty easy to fit into any team as a player because of his work ethic in his detail and just his attitude and his demeanor"" said Islanders coach Barry Trotz who mentioned Parise is looking forward to his homecoming vs. the Wild.

Parise who ranks third in Wild history in goals (199) and points (400) and seventh in games played (558) will have his family at the game; his wife Alisha and their three children haven't permanently moved to New York but they've visited Parise.

This will also be Parise's first chance to play in front of Wild fans since crowd restrictions were lifted for this season a reunion Parise is excited to have.

Hammer gave Miller exactly what she was looking for and the pair combined to finish off a 3-1 (15-25 28-26 25-23 26-24) win over the Rails to advance to the state tournament for the second time in three years.

“I was hoping Lexi was going to set me on the last play” Miller said. “I really just wanted to hammer it down and have the best celebration ever and it was just the best feeling.”

Miller led the Raiders with 18 kills and two blocks and Hammer had 40 set assists in the win.

While the match ended well there was an inauspicious beginning for Greenway after Proctor dominated the first set.

Proctor jumped out to a 19-9 lead and looked like it might make short work of the Raiders after senior hitter Payton Rodberg recorded five kills in the set. Greenway coach Rhaya Tomberlin-Anderson took her team out of the gym during the set break to settle them down after the rough start.

“I took them out of the gym and said ‘The best thing about volleyball is there’s no time limit we can go back and start over — it’s game one and the object is to win three’” Tomberlin-Anderson said. “I think the girls really believed that we could do just that — start over get some excitement and confidence and start being aggressive instead of nervous or passive.”

Greenway wasn’t able to dominate any of the sets the way Proctor dominated the first but they were able to eke out three straight wins to take the section title.

“We just started playing lax and making some mistakes and they took advantage of that” Proctor coach Trish Jauhola said.

Tomberlin-Anderson was particularly happy with Miller’s play and her improvement after she moved from middle hitter to the outside earlier this season.

“She’s started for us in the middle since ninth grade” Tomberlin-Anderson said. “We moved her to the outside halfway through the season and she just got better and better with her timing and her aggressiveness. I’m just so proud of her because she was part of the state team two years ago.”

Rodberg finished the game with 17 kills and 28 digs for the Rails and Gabby Jauhola — the only other senior for the Rails — finished with 54 set assists and 23 digs.

“Payton is so powerful and strong she just changes the momentum” Trish Jauhola said. “She does a great job. She fights she’s driven to win and that’s exactly what she did today when she got the ball.”

While Proctor’s seniors played well it was sophomore Ella Walker who led the Rails with 19 kills three aces and two blocks. Walker had several kills but her play seemed to improve as the match wore on.

“Ella this whole season has been getting stronger and stronger” coach Jauhola said. “She was the key today because they weren’t stopping our middles at all. When we could get the passes there then we could maximize having her hit. She can put it down so well and she’s smart on where to place it. She’s grown so much this season and just continued to improve every game.”

On Sunday Nov. 7 when the coaches met to determine the seeds that became a reality. The Eagles earned the No. 2 seed and will play Forest Lake at 3 p.m. Wednesday Nov. 10 at Xcel Energy Center.

The practice of seeding the top five teams in MSHSL big-school state tournaments is a given for nearly all sports. Each of the eight coaches rank the top five seeds. Those rankings decide the seeding for the tournament. After the five seeds are awarded the three teams remaining are randomly paired up against the top three seeds.

Wayzata picked up the top seed in the tournament which was hardly a shock given the Trojans are a perfect 31-0 this season and have not lost a match since October 2019.

EP (19-6) earned the second seed which would’ve likely gone to perennial power Eagan. However the Wildcats were upset in their section final by East Ridge. The Raptors’ win pushed the Eagles into the No. 2 seed while the Raptors grabbed the No. 3 seed.

The Class 4A volleyball state tournament bracket.

After the random draw it was determined EP would face Forest Lake in the quarterfinals of the Class 4A state tournament. This is the first season that the state volleyball tournament is made up of four classes. Up until last season there were just three classes.

This is the first time these two teams have met this season. The Eagles were considered the top team in Section 2AAAA and just behind Wayzata in the Lake Conference race.

Forest Lake holds a 21-10 record heading into the matchup. The Rangers finished second in the Suburban East Conference behind East Ridge and earned the No. 2 seed in the Section 7-4A tournament. The Rangers made it through section play without losing a set. That included a sweep of top-seeded Blaine in the section final.

After Forest Lake made its volleyball state tournament debut in 2002 the Rangers have most recently made appearances in 2017 and 2018. Meanwhile the Eagles are making their first appearance since 2014 and sixth overall. EP won the state championship in 2011 and were the runner up in 2012.

The Class 4A state tournament takes place over three days. If the Eagles defeat Forest Lake they will move on to the semifinals against the winner of East Ridge and Bloomington Jefferson. That match takes place at 3 p.m. Thursday Nov. 11. All matches are at the Xcel Energy Center. The Class 4A final is set to take place at 7 p.m. Saturday Nov. 13.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzExLzA2L3NhdWstcmFwaWRzLXJpY2Utdm9sbGV5YmFsbC13aW5zLXNlY3Rpb24tOC0zLWEtdGl0bGUtaGVhZHMtc3RhdGUvNjMyMDQ4NzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sauk Rapids-Rice volleyball wins Section 8-3A title heads to state,"MELROSE — The Sauk Rapids-Rice volleyball team traveled up to Melrose on Saturday for the No. 1 and 2 seed matchup in the Section 8-3A title match against No. 1 seed Alexandria.

The Cardinals came into Saturday with a 21-1 record and defeated Sauk Rapids-Rice 3-1 in the regular season as the two teams only played once in 2021.

The No. 2 seed Storm was in a battle with the Cardinals in the first two sets but Sauk Rapids-Rice was able to pull out the next two sets and win 3-1. The Storm earned the section title trophy and will be heading to the Class AAA state tournament for the first time since 1988.

Sauk Rapids-Rice started the match on a hot streak leading 17-8 and eventually winning 25-18. It seemed like the Storm had the momentum but Alexandria came out firing in the second set.

The Cardinals took control of the second set at the beginning and always had a lead. At one point Alexandria led 16-8 and won 25-13 to tie the match at 1-1.

At that point Alexandria had the momentum and confidence after dominating in the second set but that didn't phase Sauk Rapids-Rice. The two teams went back-and-forth in both the third and fourth sets.

Neither team really took a strong lead as the two teams exchanged points left and right. Eventually the Storm stepped up when needed at the end of both sets to win the third set 25-18 and the fourth set 25-22 to win the match.

Sauk Rapids-Rice has relied on its senior class to guide this team all season and those seniors stepped up on Saturday night.

The Storm won't know its opponent until later this weekend after all the section tournaments have finished. The one thing that's certain is that Sauk Rapids-Rice will play at the Xcel Energy Center on Wednesday at either 5 or 7 p.m.

Regardless if the Storm win or lose on Wednesday the team will advance either to the semifinals or the loser's bracket quarterfinals and play on Friday at either 5 or 7 p.m.

Sauk Rapids-Rice goes into the state tournament with a record of 13-16.

They're costly because they require additional employee time for sorting monitoring and treating in a hospital pen. Sick animals are certainly not productive and they introduce additional risks to an operation.

While judicious use of antibiotics to treat dairy animals is an important component in maintaining a healthy herd keeping animals healthy should start by setting them up in conditions that minimize disease pressure.

""There are many things in the dairy farm environment that can be monitored and addressed to keep the herd healthy"" says Matthew Boyle senior veterinarian dairy technical services with Zoetis. ""When we work with a dairy we first look at the day-to-day operations so we can get better at creating conditions that minimize disease pressure in the first place.""

The primary partner should be your veterinarian. ""Producers should have active ongoing dialogue with their veterinarian"" Boyle says. ""He or she has an intimate working knowledge of the current conditions on your farm. The vet is the one who works with the management team to write protocols and prescriptions and takes responsibility for antibiotic use on the farm.""

Issues like proper ventilation overcrowding feed delivery and manure removal can have a direct impact on an animal's health and well-being. So can employee interaction with the herd.

Nipping problems in the bud before disease occurs and ensuring sick animals are treated properly are two main components that can reduce overall antibiotic use.

""Some animals will get sick. We need to ensure prompt discovery and institute the appropriate treatment protocol early in the course of disease"" Boyle says.

Read the Label

No matter how careful you might be cows can and will get sick. Antibiotics are powerful tools in helping ensure cows can get back to health yet they also need to be used carefully. That means paying close attention to all label instructions.

""The label must be read and understood"" Boyle says. ""That is where working with your veterinarian is critical to ensure you are using the right product at the right dose on the right animal through the correct route of administration and for the proper duration. It is imperative that we use antibiotics in this responsible manner so we can meet our charge of producing wholesome food while at the same time creating situations that provide for the best possible outcome for a sick animal.""

What is the dose? What's the route of administration? Does it go in the muscle? Does it go under the skin? How many days is it administered? What is the withdrawal period? These are all questions that need to be answered before the first dose is given. ""Once we've chosen the antibiotic we want to use we need to ask if we are dosing the animal correctly. A first-lactation dairy cow might only weigh 1200 pounds but her herd mate might be a third-lactation cow that weighs 1600 pounds. The dose for those two animals is very different"" Boyle says. Underdosing and overdosing both introduce risk.

Producers should also work closely with their vet to ensure they are selecting animals that are good candidates for treatment.

""You need to ask if the animal is likely to respond to the antibiotic treatment and return to good levels of production before you ever start a treatment regimen"" he says.

Predict an Animal's Predisposition for Wellness

It stands to reason that fewer sick animals will ultimately lead to reduced antibiotic use. Producers have a new tool that can help predict animal wellness for genetic resistance to mastitis lameness metritis retained placenta displaced abomasum respiratory disease ketosis and calf-wellness traits for calf livability respiratory disease and scours. That tool is genomic testing.

""Using our genomic test we are able to make predictions about a particular animal's relative risk to experience one of the six major disease conditions so the producer will know something about that animal's biological risks relative to her herd mates"" Boyle says.

""The new frontier is selecting for animals less likely to get sick and less likely to need an antibiotic therapy"" he adds. ""At Zoetis our genomic test for wellness is Clarifide Plus. The reliability of these traits in the Holstein and Jersey breeds while already good continues to improve as more genomic data is collected and analyzed.""

Testing Increases Herd's Genetic Value Profitability

Brad Nosbush who operates Nosbush Dairy in Fairfax Minnesota with brothers David and Leroy started using genomic testing in 2010. Every animal in their 900-head milking herd is genomic-tested. For Nosbush genomic testing is a no-brainer.

""Testing increases genetic value for our herd and increases the likelihood of profitability"" he says. ""We also cull low-ranking females as calves so animals with poor traits never enter the herd.""

Analyzing the genomic data allows Nosbush to select animals with the best profile. ""We look at genomic data when making breeding decisions. The best animals will receive sexed semen and the rest will be inseminated with beef semen"" he says.

This strategy allows Nosbush to build a future herd of cows less likely to get sick while at the same time walks less favorable genetics off the farm.

Semen allocation is one of many ways dairy farmers use genomic data.

The cost of a genomic test varies depending on the genomic panel the producer chooses to run. However the payoff is huge not only in strengthening a herd's genetic makeup but also in circumventing potential health issues before they occur.

""A good way to think about the cost of a Clarifide Plus test is that our premium panel will be cheaper than a single straw of sexed semen from a premium bull"" Boyle says.

""With the data we are collecting we are able to use genomics to find animals with the traits we want"" Boyle says. ""We can select animals and create future herds that have it all: top milk production and superior health traits.""

Additional data collected as more producers make use of genomic testing can help further refine trait selection and make it more reliable. ""If we select animals that are less likely to get sick we can improve the herd and reduce the use of and need for antibiotics.""

Producers have been quick to adopt the program. ""Adoption of genomic testing has been growing steadily since it became commercially available"" Boyle says. ""Our premium panel that incorporates the wellness traits now represents more than 70% of all the tests we run in our lab.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzcm91bmQvNTkxODg4NznSASxodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3c3JvdW5kLzU5MTg4ODc5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hyenas catch covid in world first at in Denver zoo,"Two hyenas have caught coronavirus becoming the first confirmed case in hyenas in the world.

Not even the early morning drizzles thawed the enthusiasm of the 200 invited farmers as they flocked Rwebitaba ZARDI in Kyembogo Fort Portal City for the 24th Seeds of Gold Farm Clinic.

In their hands were notebooks and pens and a copy of Seeds of Gold all in anticipation of what they were going to learn at the event sponsored by Naro Bank of Uganda Stanbic Bank NSSF and Zoetis.

Farmers speak out

Maureen Kabugho from Kamwenge District wanted to know about the best practices to follow to improve her dairy herd.

“Successful dairy farming involves giving your animals balanced feeds good record-keeping practices proper breeding and frequently checking on the animals’ health” Dr Robooni Tumuhimbise the director of Rwebitaba ZARDI explained.

“I am a keen follower of the farm clinics. I have attended four clinics and did not want to miss this one” said Christopher Mubiito a dairy farmer from Kamwenge who also grows tea on 20 acres.

The farmer arrived in Fort Portal City a day before the event and sought accommodation at a nearby hotel.

“What I learn from the clinics is invaluable. I always ensure I arrive early so that I don’t miss anything.”

“Now I know how to plant different grasses and the time when it is supposed to be harvested and how to feed the animals” said Rosette Kaija from Nyakasura in Kabarole District.

Col Steven Basaliza a tea farmer from Kabarole District said: “I travelled today morning purposely for this training I have been growing tea but today I have got new knowledge I did not know. It is today that I have come to know that before planting I need to first test my soil.”

Maureen Kasiime from Kamwenge District said the training equipped her with skills on how to start fish farming saying that previously she had no idea.

“When I go back home I will start fish farming because the knowledge I have acquired is enough now I know how to dig a fish pond and how to feed the fish and time of harvesting” he said.

Edwin Atukunda Beekunda a farmer from Kamwenge District called upon his colleagues to interact and share knowledge and ideas on agribusinesses to uplift each other. Beekunda has more than 40 acres of tea in Kamwenge.

Arthur Asaba a farmer from Kyenjojo District said his interest was to learn about bees most especially the stingless type.

“This training has equipped me with knowledge on how to keep bees” he said.

“I now know that a farmer must consult an expert before excavating a fish pond” Amb Steven Katenta Apuli from Kabarole District said.

Lessons

According to Dr Sadik Kassim the deputy director general of Naro the clinics offer farmers a golden opportunity to get quality knowledge and skills access a wide range of products at farm level as compared to when they just go to an agrovet and purchase a product that they have very little knowledge and guidelines about.

“The importance of such events is that farmers come with questions and go back home with solutions” said Dr Sadik.",,,,,,
