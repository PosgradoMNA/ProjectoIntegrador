Sarah Park has known about the impact of music on the brain since a young age. The 13-year-old who has been playing violin since she was 4 says she noticed its positive effect on those around her especially her grandmother who suffered from a mental health illness.

Now the Jacksonville Florida middle-schooler hopes to use music therapy to help others struggling with mental health. Her invention Spark Care+ earned her the title of ""America's Top Young Scientist"" at the 3M Young Scientist Challenge on October 19 2021.

""I was pretty shocked when they announced my name as the grand prize winner"" Park said. ""I was excited and thrilled with what's to come next with Spark Care+.""

Spark Care+ requires participants to respond to a series of questions based on the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale designed to assess the person's mental state. The device's inbuilt sensors record vital mental health indicators such as heart rate and blood pressure. Spark Care+'s AI (Artificial Intelligence) component analyzes the information and recommends the appropriate music to help lift the participant's spirits. It also monitors its impact on the listener.

The ninth-grader hopes to turn her prototype into a wristband with inbuilt sensors a heart-rate monitor and Bluetooth. She also wants to build an app to make Spark Care+ accessible to everyone. ""I hope to be able to distribute it around the world to people of all ages"" Park says.

In addition to being an inventor Park is also a musical prodigy who has won several violin competitions including the Florida state championship. She also plays the piano and is a math champion. The teen aspires to be an innovator and researcher in the medical field using technology and robotics. Her advice to other young scientists? ""Dream big ask questions and anything is possible.""

Brodzinski took a pass from Blake McLaughlin and shot from just inside the blue line beating Irish goaltender Ryan Bischel. Brock Faber also assisted on the goal.

Jack LaFontaine made 26 saves for the Gophers (5-3 2-0) and finished the weekend with 54 saves on 57 shots.

Minnesota won the series opener 4-1 on Friday night and has won four consecutive games against the Irish.

""It was a huge weekend for us. … I really feel Jack was great"" Gophers coach Bob Motzko said Saturday. ""Let's hope that it's another step forward for us in the right direction.""

Ryan Bischel made 21 saves for Notre Dame (4-3 0-2).

The Gophers led twice earlier in the game but each time the Irish came back to tie the score.

Grant Cruikshank opened the scoring with the only goal of the first period at 11:25. Rhett Pitlick earned the second assist on the goal his first point scored as a Gopher.

Notre Dame's Grant Silianoff tied it 1-1 with one second remaining in the second period after LaFontaine gave up a rebound.

At 2:27 of the third period Jonny Sorenson gave Minnesota the lead back with an unassisted goal. A deflected puck bounced back to him at the blue line and he broke in alone and beat Bischel with a backhand.

Solag Bakich tied it again on an odd-man break for Notre Dame just 29 seconds later.

Click here for updates on this story

NASHVILLE Tennessee (WSMV) — Three women are suing QNTM a downtown gym for $3 million stating that it didn’t do enough to protect them one of the trainers.

That trainer Nikko Glasper faces criminal charges for stealing intimate photos from the women’s phones and taking pictures of them naked while they thought they were alone.

“They went to this gym to get help with body imaging to stay in shape. And now what they have from it is a lifetime of potential emotional problems. That’s what they got in return for their VIP membership” said Michael Pence an attorney representing the women.

Pence said QNTM did not supervise or train employees to ensure the women were protected. Glapser is also being sued for invasion of privacy.

In a brief phone interview on October 7 Glasper told News4 Investigates that he’d done something wrong.

“The statement I make is I made terrible decisions. And I stand to know that I did something wrong. But I also would like for everyone to know the character/person that I am – and to say that these crimes – as they were done – are terrible things but I am not a terrible human” Glasper said.

Neither Glasper nor a spokesperson for QNTM responded to our request for comment by our deadline.

A seven-page summary on issues related to the botched EMS billing service scolded former officials Fire Chief Mark Martin and Fiscal Officer Joe Schlegel as well as Cynthia Abbott who under the banner of C&C Medical Billing Co. cost the township significant funding in 2016 and 2017.

More:State auditor: Perry Township owed $1.1 million for EMS services

The township was shortchanged more than $1.1 million from C&C Medical stemming from faulty EMS billing outlined in a 2019 financial audit by the state which discovered discrepancies in 2016 and 2017 with the company's billing service.

Ems Report- Leslie Iams Kuntz | PDF

Trustee Mike Shreffler told The Independent this week that Perry has recouped around $900000 of lost income through a rebilling effort. More revenue but likely not the entire $1.1 million sum is expected to be recovered down the road he said.

Shreffler was appointed as a trustee in April 2020 a few years after the EMS billing issue occurred. He was one of three officials who sought to have the matter looked into by an independent entity.

'Grossly negligent' in oversight duties

Martin is deemed to have been ""grossly negligent"" in performance of his departmental oversight duties over the period of the billing blunder per the report. Schlegel earned blame for not catching the lags in EMS revenue.

Schlegel declined to specifically address the EMS billing issue when reached by phone noting that a possible legal case is pending that does not involve him.

The township does not foresee criminal charges being filed in the billing matter although a state probe remains open Shreffler said.

More:Perry Township wants charges over EMS billing; finds fault with fire chief

The township's independent report was conducted by the Krugliak Wilkins Griffiths & Dougherty Co. law firm which determined that Martin had approved payments to C&C on two occasions without a formal contract in place.

The firm's March 16 summary which was written by attorney Leslie Iams Kunz called out that action because Abbott had access to confidential patient information.

Perry trustees released Kunz's report last week due to several public records requests made for the document over the past few months.

""A lot of people had asked for it"" Shreffler said. ""If we're going to be transparent you have to release it.""

Chief failed to research Abbott's qualifications per report

Cynthia Abbott is the spouse of now-retired Perry Deputy Fire Chief Mark Abbott.

Kuntz's report noted that Martin admitted to doing no research into Cynthia Abbott's qualifications. Instead he relied on her being a Perry resident her employment with the previous township EMS billing vendor and the wife of the deputy chief.

More:Perry Township trustees ask local law firm to look into Fire Department EMS conduct

""The lack of understanding about (Abbott's) capabilities (by Martin) later proved to be an issue when the (Fire Department's) billing system was changed to electronic"" the document states.

Phone messages left for Martin and Cynthia Abbott were not returned this week.

Report: Deputy chief would 'act as mule' for EMS info.

According to the investigation then-deputy chief Abbott would ferry daily EMS run reports to his wife who would use the data to invoice the township. Perry employees were aware of the arrangement.

The deputy chief was unaware any action was inappropriate.

When a new electronic billing system was put in place Mark Abbott continued to ""act as a mule"" for information verbally informing (Cynthia Abbott) of monthly EMS runs to generate invoices the report states.

More:Mark Abbott began career with Perry Fire Department in 1989 as volunteer

Kuntz wrote that Perry's ""lax administration"" was a result of Martin failing to develop a system to verify or monitor whether claims were being properly billed.

""No one was tracking whether or not the invoices or billings were correct"" according to the report.

Once Martin and Schlegel became aware of the billing problem they failed to timely report the matter to the top brass of the township's chain of command.

Criminal charges sought without success

Part of Kuntz's report recommends pursuing criminal charges against Cynthia Abbott Martin and Schlegel.

In March Perry trustees agreed to seek charges against Abbott. They discussed possible complaints against Martin and Schlegel but did not push for the action.

Efforts to generate charges against Abbott via the Stark County Prosecutor's Office have been rebuffed said Shreffler adding that a separate request to the Ohio attorney general has stagnated.

It's doubtful any official legal complaint will be brought according to Shreffler.

""I just don't think we're going to get there (with any criminal charges)"" he said.

Released today ahead of COP26 in Glasgow business leaders are also sounding the alarm on the early onset of climate-induced disruption and looking for government action — particularly in areas of clear carbon pricing infrastructure investment and financial commitments to an equitable net-zero transition in the Global South — as the window to meet the 1.5°C target by 2030 has started to close.

According to Climate Leadership in the Eleventh Hour — which includes extensive 1:1 interviews with more than 100 leading chief executives and a survey of over 1100 CEOs across 113 countries and 21 industries — private sector leaders are struggling to accelerate their climate ambitions even though nearly three-quarters (73%) say they feel increasing pressure to act. More than half (57%) of surveyed executives say they are prioritizing climate action amid their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.



Forty-nine percent of CEOs point to supply chain interruptions due to extreme weather as a top risk but only 7% said they are ‘advanced’ in setting up early warning systems to prepare for climate-risk events. Moreover 71% say they are actively working to develop a net-zero emissions target for their company and 57% believe they are operating in line with the 1.5°C goal. Yet as an indicator only 2% of these companies have a formal target validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.



“There are two possible roads ahead: a deeply flawed business as usual approach or a global economy that protects people the planet and the natural systems that sustain us” said Sanda Ojiambo CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact. “Business as usual is no longer an option. It is clear from the CEOs we surveyed that the business community feels unprepared to deal with our climate emergency. The UN Global Compact has a critical role to play in helping companies develop practical tools and effective best practices to deal with the challenges ahead while also ensuring they can engage with governments on policy and regulation.”



The landmark study also points to a key stakeholder shift when it comes to driving CEOs’ climate leadership and action. The biggest shift seen in 14 years of the study was investors and capital markets moving from eight in 2019 to top three in the minds of CEOs going into COP26. The trend reflects the largest jump in stakeholder influence since the study’s inception in 2007 as investors put ever greater pressure on businesses to map the risks and understand the opportunity presented by the transition to a 1.5°C net-zero world.



“The Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement commitments offer the clearest roadmap for how business should lead on climate and the innovation required to solve the world’s greatest challenges. But with only a narrow window of time left to meet these goals and with the physical effects of climate change being felt sooner than most CEOs expected leaders must stand up and be held accountable for measurable performance” said Peter Lacy Accenture’s global Sustainability Services lead chief responsibility officer and member of the Global Management Committee. “The science economics and data tell us that when leaders bridge business value with sustainability and technology impact competitive advantage can thrive.”



The UN Global Compact-Accenture study highlights efforts from leading CEOs to increase their sustainability budgets diversify their operations and workforces and accelerate R&D in climate-resilient solutions driving higher standards of accountability and showing what is possible when ambition meets action on climate. Though nearly two-thirds (65%) of leaders are already advancing new net-zero business models and solutions to meet their goals only 16% of all CEOs said their maturity is at an advanced stage today.



“CEOs used to say that the relevant technologies were too nascent. Well they’re now mature. Or they would say that investors and capital markets were not fully on board with ESG data. But they are now. What we simply don’t have more of now is time. Governments must act and CEOs are ready to step up. This is not just the right thing to do — there is real business value at stake as well” added Lacy.



The upcoming COP26 meeting presents a pivotal moment for change in sustainability. With business leaders cautiously optimistic on international cooperation to solve the climate crisis they are highlighting five critical asks for negotiators to help them take bolder action and deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement commitments. They are:

Align Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to a 1.5°C warming trajectory Enhance global cooperation on carbon pricing mechanisms aligned with the Paris Agreement Meet and exceed the USD 100 billion commitment in climate financing for the Global South Establish common standards for biodiversity protection and pathways for nature-based solutions Increase business engagement in climate policy formation for collaborative climate action

“Confronting a triple planetary emergency — a climate crisis a biodiversity crisis and a pollution crisis — everyone needs to scale up our ambitions and speed up our actions. The private sector has a special responsibility in our collective effort to build a sustainable net zero resilient and equitable world and to act on pledges with credible timelines targets and plans. We have what it takes to realize the promise of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement — but it will take the full commitment of every one of us” concluded United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed.

Exercise equipment. Breakfast cereal. By now you’ve probably heard: The world has run short of a great many products.

In an era in which we’ve become accustomed to clicking and waiting for whatever we desire to arrive at our doors we have experienced the shock of not being able to buy toilet paper having to wait months for curtains and needing to compromise on the color of our new cars.

Of far greater importance we have suffered a pandemic without adequate protective gear. Doctors cannot obtain needed medicines. In Alaska people are struggling to find enough winter coats. Airplanes are delayed while crews wait for food deliveries.

Why is this happening?

The pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain — that’s the usually invisible pathway of manufacturing transportation and logistics that gets goods from where they are manufactured mined or grown to where they are going. At the end of the chain is another company or a consumer who has paid for the finished product. Scarcity has caused the prices of many things to go higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzZGVzay5jby5uei9hcnRpY2xlL3RoZS1saWZlL215LW5ldC13b3J0aC1qdXN0aW4tbW93ZGF5LWNlby10aGUtbW9ua2V5cy1hbmQtbWFuYWdpbmctZGlyZWN0b3ItYWNjZW50dXJlLWludGVyYWN0aXZl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Net Worth: Justin Mowday CEO The Monkeys and managing director Accenture Interactive,"Welcome to My Net Worth our regular column on the lives and motivations of our country’s top business legal and political people in their own words.

Justin Mowday is one of New Zealand’s most senior advertising executives. A former CEO of creative agency DDB – where he led a team of 270 – he was hired by advisory giant Accenture this year to lead its New Zealand advertising business The Monkeys. Since studying for a bachelor of business degree at AUT majoring in marketing Mowday has worked for some of the region’s biggest ad firms including TBWA and Saatchi & Saatchi. At The Monkeys he is leading attempts to merge the advisory expertise of Accenture with the skills of a traditional creative agency amid an ongoing shift in the global advertising industry.

My mum’s family is from Bluff and my dad’s from Wellington but I grew up in Glenfield Auckland. I was lucky enough to have a loving household even if we were short of a bob.

My father was in public relations but I didn't know what advertising was. I discovered my career entirely by luck but I was probably always destined to go in that direction. At school I was better at English and geography than science and got involved in the debating team.

I ended up doing some work experience with my uncle in Wellington. He drove a Porsche and worked at a great advertising agency called Goldsack Harris Thompson. I just thought that was pretty cool. I'd found the industry I wanted to work in. Unfortunately it's as shallow as that. But I’m one of the lucky ones to have fallen into an industry I genuinely love.

Justin Mowday in 1992.

My biggest achievement is starting The Monkeys Aotearoa and leading Accenture Interactive in New Zealand. It’s scarily amazing. I’m blown away by the smarts and depth at Accenture and the support we’ve had. It’s a chance to put into practice all the things we believe in and so far that’s working.

When I look back on my career I definitely have a few regrets but if I dwell on them too much it’ll stress me out. So I try to look at them as learning moments take the lessons and move forward. The key is not to repeat the mistake right?

Like a lot of people especially in lockdown I juggle things as best I can. My wife is also trying to work so we’re both trying to entertain and grow a little four-year-old and spend time with and guide our 14- and 16-year-olds who are kindly helping us with the four-year-old. If anyone’s cracked a magic code on this please give me a bell.

I’ve always been competitive and have wanted to succeed and see the team succeed on the world stage – to be recognised as world class from this little old island down at the edge of the world. But I’ve never wanted to get there at the expense of people by pushing them to breaking point or asking unreasonable things of them.

I feel like we’re now trying to chart a different course – by investing in people caring about them creating an environment where they feel safe nurtured and inspired. Can we also be the best in the world? I think there’s a different way to create a high-performance culture than working extreme hours and using brute force.

My biggest career influence has been colleagues and friends sharing and being vocal as part of this global movement towards doing business differently – caring about your people running a business that contributes back to society as well as making a profit. The whole triple-bottom-line theory.

Māori were already onto this as is often the case by consciously considering pūtake (the reason for existing) and tikanga (values and priorities) as part of doing business. It’s absolutely crucial that we run successful and profitable companies but equally important to feel like your people are thriving and that you’re improving society and looking after the environment. Many smart people around me have taught me that over the years.

The most valuable things I own are the hand-made birthday and Father’s Day cards my kids make for me each year. My four-year-old loves making them the 14- and 16-year-olds less so but I love them.

I tend to splurge on experiences rather than things. Tourism New Zealand has done a good job of encouraging us to explore our own backyard. We go away and do lots of things while we’re there.

Like every year Adobe’s Max 2021 event featured product reveals and other innovations happening at the world’s leading computer graphics software company.

Among the most interesting features of the event is Adobe’s continued integration of artificial intelligence into its products a venue that the company has been exploring in the past few years.

Like many other companies Adobe is leveraging deep learning to improve its applications and solidify its position in the video and image editing market. In turn the use of AI is shaping Adobe’s product strategy.

Sensei Adobe’s AI platform is now integrated into all the products of its Creative Cloud suite. Among the features revealed in this year’s conference is an auto-masking tool in Photoshop which enables you to select an object simply by hovering your mouse over it. A similar feature automatically creates mask layers for all the objects it detects in a scene.

Photoshop’s auto-mask feature in action

The auto-mask feature saves a lot of time especially in images where objects have complex contours and colors and would be very difficult to select with classic tools.

Adobe has also improved Neural Filters a feature it added to Photoshop last year. Neural Filters use machine learning to add enhancements to images. Many of the filters are applicable to portraits and images of people. For example you can apply skin smoothing transfer makeup from a source image to a target image or change the expression of a subject in a photo.

Other Neural Filters make more general changes such as colorizing black-and-white images or changing the background landscape.

Neural Filters can colorize black-and-white images or change the background landscape.

The Max conference also unveiled some preview and upcoming technologies. For example a new feature for Adobe’s photo collection product called “in-between” takes two or more photos that were captured at a short interval of each other and it creates a video by automatically generating the frames that were in-between the photos.

Another feature being developed is “on point” which helps you search Adobe’s huge library of stock images by providing a reference pose. For example if you provide it with a photo of a person sitting and reaching out their hand the machine learning models will detect the pose of the person and find other photos where people are in similar positions.

AI features have been added to Lightroom Premiere and other Adobe products as well.

The challenges of delivering AI products

When you look at Adobe’s AI features individually none of them are groundbreaking. While Adobe did not provide any architectural or implementation details in the event anyone who has been following AI research can immediately relate each of the features presented at Max to one or more papers and presentations made at machine learning and computer vision conferences in the past few years. Auto-masking uses object detection and segmentation with deep learning an area of research that has seen tremendous progress recently.

Style transfer with neural networks is a technique that is at least four years old. And generative adversarial networks (GAN) which power several of the image generation features have been around for more than seven years. In fact a lot of the technologies Adobe is using are open source and freely available.

The real genius behind Adobe’s AI is not the superior technology but the company’s strategy for delivering the products to its customers.

A successful product needs to have a differentiating value that convinces users to start using it or switch from their old solutions to the new application.

The benefits of applying deep learning to different image processing applications are very clear. They result in improved productivity and lower costs. The assistance provided by deep learning models can help lower the barrier of artistic creativity for people who don’t have the skills and experience of expert graphical designers. In the case of auto-masking and neural filters the tools make it possible even for experienced users to solve their problems faster and better. Some of the new features such as the “in-between” feature are addressing problems that had not been solved by other applications.

But beyond superior features a successful product needs to be delivered to its target audience in a way that is frictionless and cost-effective. For example say you develop a state-of-the-art deep learning–powered neural filter application and want to sell it on the market. Your target users are graphic designers who are already using a photo-editing tool such as Photoshop. If they want to apply your neural filter they’ll have to constantly port their images between Photoshop and your application which causes too much friction and degrades the user experience.

You’ll also have to deal with the costs of deep learning. Many user devices don’t have the memory and processing capacity to run neural networks and require cloud-based processing. Therefore you’ll have to set up servers and web APIs to serve the deep learning models and you also have to make sure your service will remain online and available as the usage scales. You only recoup such costs when you reach a large number of paying users.

You’ll also have to figure out how to monetize your product in a way that covers your costs while also keeping users interested in using it. Will your product be an ads-based free product a freemium model a one-time payment or a subscription service? Most clients prefer to avoid working with several software vendors that have different payment models.

And you’ll need an outreach strategy to make your product visible to its intended market. Will you run ads on social media make direct sales and reach out to design companies or use content marketing? Many products fail not because they don’t solve a core problem but because they can’t reach out to the right market and deliver their product in a cost-efficient manner.

And finally you’ll need a roadmap to continuously iterate and improve your product. For example if you’re using machine learning to enhance images you’ll need a workflow to constantly gather new data find out where your models are failing and finetune them to improve their performance.

Adobe’s AI strategy

Adobe’s Photoshop and Illustrator are incredibly powerful tools

Adobe already has a very large share of the graphics software market. Millions of people use Adobe’s applications every day so the company has no problem in reaching out to its intended market. Whenever it has a new deep learning tool it can immediately use the vast reach of Photoshop Premiere and the other applications in its Creative Cloud suite to make it visible and available to users. Users don’t need to pay for or install any new applications; they just need to download the new plugins into their applications.

The company’s gradual transition to the cloud in the past few years has also paved the way for a seamless integration of deep learning into its applications. Most of Adobe’s AI features run in the cloud. To its users the experience of the cloud-based features is no different than using filters and tools that are directly running on their own devices. Meanwhile the scale of Adobe’s cloud makes it possible for the company to run deep learning inference in a very cost-effective way which is why most new AI features are made available for free to users who already have a Creative Cloud subscription.

Finally the cloud-based deep learning model provides Adobe with the opportunity to run a very efficient AI factory. As Adobe’s cloud serves deep learning models to its users it will also gather data to improve the performance of its AI features in the future. For example the company acknowledged at the Max conference that the auto-masking feature does not work for all objects yet but will improve over time. The continued iteration will in turn enable Adobe to enhance its AI capabilities and strengthen its position in the market. The AI in turn will shape the products Adobe will roll out in the future.

Running applied machine learning projects is very difficult which is most companies fail in bringing them to fruition. Adobe is an interesting case study of how bringing together the right elements can turn advances in AI into profitable business applications.

If you’re not from Texas or if you’re from what we Panhandlers like to call “South Texas” which is any part of the state closer to Mexico than Lubbock then you might not be familiar with Adobe Walls. But to those of us who grew up in that squared off corner of the Lone Star State on the southern end of the Great Plains it’s a story as familiar as the Alamo. Every Panhandle kid knows the names Quanah Parker Kit Carson and Billy Dixon.

In two battles 10 years apart a band of buffalo hunters defended a little sod camp near the Canadian River against attack from Comanche Kiowa and Plains Apache warriors led by Parker the son of kidnapped white woman Cynthia Ann Parker and Comanche chief Peta Nocona.

In a larger sense it was the Native Americans doing the defending not only from encroaching white settlers but from buffalo hunters who threatened to (and eventually did) decimate the herds on which their livelihood depended betraying treaties not to do so along the way.

The Kiowa I believe were especially fierce warriors. In this essay I’ll use “Kiowa” as a stand-in for the inter-tribal coalition that fought at Adobe Walls. I’m doing so because the historical record seems pretty fuzzy when it comes to which tribes participated in which conflicts at Adobe Walls and because the tribes themselves overlapped since “Plains Apache” were also “Kiowa Apache.”

I carry a special admiration for the Kiowa Tribe though. It was instilled in me at Booker High School the only school in Texas with the Kiowa mascot.

In 1990 long before controversy over the “Washington Football Team” representatives from the Kiowa Tribe visited the Friday night lights in my hometown and presented me and two other members of our football team with ceremonial gifts including a spear. They adopted our little school as honorary members of their tribe — a tragedy of grace I was too young to grasp at the time.

That was 30 years ago. The news this week and the reason for my retreat into plains history was the listing for sale of the Turkey Track Ranch in nearby Hutchinson County — 80000 acres along the Canadian River breaks that includes the site of Adobe Walls. The marketing videos look nothing like the hardpan plains I know. Booker can be described with many adjectives. “Verdant” is not one of them. Nor is “comfortable.”

A few years ago my mother gave me a book for Christmas Timothy Egan’s terrific Dust Bowl remembrance called The Worst Hard Time. It’s a story about rugged people in a stubborn land or vice versa. She put it in my hand and said: “Read this. It’ll help you understand your people.”

My people came to the Texas Panhandle in the middle of the 19th century to find fortunes or outlaws. One was a cattle driver. Another a Texas Ranger. Their stories are pocked with heartache like a prairie with buffalo wallows: sickness drought death in childbirth. The land they settled seldom cooperated.

By contrast Turkey Track Ranch is pastoral and serene. Bernard Uechtritz the Dallas real estate mogul selling it calls it “the oasis of the Panhandle.” When I got him on the phone he told me the ranch contains 26 miles of the Canadian River “hundreds of springs” and “a number of lakes and reservoirs.” And all of it could be mine for just $200 million. That’s 13 times the price of the same land plus a little extra that changed hands in the Louisiana Purchase 61 years before the first battle of Adobe Walls.

That battle happened on Nov. 25 1864. Col. Christopher “Kit” Carson led the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Cavalry to protect “the Walls” from Kiowa raids that were becoming more frequent as American military strength was being spent in the Civil War. Carson was badly outnumbered and barely managed to escape a Texas-sized prequel to Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer’s bloody defeat a few years later and a few hundred miles north. Carson did so by setting prairie fires to cover his retreat.

The second battle of Adobe Walls on June 27 1874 is the one white settlers remembered better. After a daybreak attack that killed three buffalo hunters the Kiowa cavalry more than 1000 strong retreated and watched effectively laying siege to the Walls far enough away that the settlers spent the second day burying their dead dragging dead horses away from camp and even sending messengers to warn nearby settlements.

But on the third day of the siege Billy Dixon leveled his .50 caliber Sharps at a group of 15 Kiowa at the top of a bluff nearly a mile away aimed well over their heads and promptly dropped one off his horse. A post-battle U.S. Army survey of the site put the distance of that shot at 1538 yards. According to a book titled Life and Adventures of “Billy” Dixon a medicine man named Isatai’i had promised victory to the warriors and immunity from the white man’s bullets. Dixon’s shot was so dispiriting that they abandoned the fight.

That second battle is marked today by a marble monolith bearing the names of “28 brave frontiersmen” who fought it. In 1924 W.T. Coble then-owner of the Turkey Track unveiled the marker and deeded five acres to the Panhandle Plains Historical Society for the permanent preservation of Adobe Walls. Little was done to remember the Kiowa who died to protect their land and livelihood.

There’s not much to preserve anyway. The tiny site is surrounded by a janky pipe fence. My last visit was decades ago and I vaguely remember the ruined foundations of a few buildings being swallowed by the prairie.

While studying Texas history in the seventh grade like all good Texans I built an eight-foot diorama of the Adobe Walls battleground. To get the scale right the buildings had to be the size of my thumbnail. A thin white string traced the path of Dixon’s bullet. That project was displayed (briefly) at the Wolf Creek Heritage Museum in Lipscomb. The unwieldy thing may still exist somewhere in my parents’ attic in Booker.

Uechtritz the ranch broker said the Turkey Track is “one of one” meaning there’s nothing like it in the American West. He has sold other one-of-a-kind ranches including the 560000-acre Waggoner ranch in 2016. Uechtritz promised me that he wouldn’t let the Turkey Track be divided at least not for this sale. It’s too special too rich in natural resources and cultural history. Plus it’s one of the few great big old Texas ranches still producing. He said there’s about a 50/50 chance it will sell to an international buyer. There’s no way to tell if it will remain a working ranch.

In a 2017 study called Texas Land Trends the Texas A&M Natural Resources Institute reported that the portion of our state used for ranching is declining fast. Between 1997 and 2017 Texas lost 2.2 million acres of working lands more than half of that in the last five years of that period.

Perhaps the new owner will be a Texas oil baron or a ranching family with deep roots here. Just as likely it will be a Russian oligarch or an Asian corporation that will stock it with Ibex and charge $20000 for luxury guided hunts.

The first battle at Adobe Walls was the last time Kiowa warriors forced American troops to retreat from a battlefield. The second battle marked the beginning of the end of a way of life for the plains tribes. It led to the Red River War that resulted in relocation of those tribes to reservations in what is now Oklahoma. It was from one of those reservations that Kiowa leaders drove to Booker in 1990 to hand me a spear.

“Read this and you’ll understand your people” Mom said. My people were not Kiowa. Nor ranchers. Nor barons. Nor really much of anything. Best I can tell they were lawmen outlaws and drunks — sometimes all three at once. Dwellers in New Mexico gas camps and Panhandle carbon black plants. Riders of covered wagons on their way across the prairie to settle tiny Lefors in Gray County. One of them pursued Butch Cassidy in Wyoming if the internet research is to be believed. Another refused to be photographed as a schoolboy in preparation for the eventuality of life on the lam.

They seem to have been less concerned with taking Kiowa lands than with simply making a living. Or maybe that’s just what I hope to be true. I imagine they were drawn to the open prairie by thin possibility — the slim chance to make their own way by their own hard work and initiative. That’s a Panhandle perspective. The place has always been about risk and reward. Only the blindly optimistic the socially rejected or the criminally indebted believed their best futures lay in the hard-packed earth there. To move to the Panhandle was to believe in miracles.

To paraphrase the late singer/songwriter Rich Mullins:

You talk about your miracles talk about your faith

My dad he could make things grow out of Panhandle clay

Mom could make a gourmet meal out of just cornbread and beans

They worked to give faith hands and feet and somehow gave it wings.

Like a mother who wants to pass something on to her son my people have a connection to a shared past — to a history that began before the Turkey Track before Adobe Walls.

And like all Panhandlers Kiowa included my people have a connection to the land that torments them as often as it rewards them slows down their pickups on the way to service oil wells stations tumbleweeds at their fences as if mustered for attack turns their gardens lunar.

On Monday when I called Mom to get some of the family history straight she was watering the neighbors’ plants while they were out of town saving vegetables from the dry prairie wind neighbors banded together against the elements the way it has been for generations.

The joke about the Panhandle is that it’s God’s country — so barren only God could love it. In my experience Panhandlers may not love their land but they’re loyal to it. That hasn’t changed since Quanah Parker and Kit Carson.

I just hope whoever buys the Turkey Track protects those connections. Paints the pipe fence around the monument. Mows the prairie grass. Stands where the settlement looked up at the treeless bluff and then stands on the bluff squinting down toward the barrel of Billy Dixon’s long-spent rifle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZnN0b3BwZXJzLmNvbS9waG90b3Nob3AvY29weS1hbnktY29sb3ItZ3JhZGUteW91ci1waG90by1uZXctcGhvdG9zaG9wLXRvb2wtNTg1MDQ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Copy Any Color Grade to Your Photo With the New Photoshop Tool,"Adobe has released a slew of new features in the recent Photoshop 2022 update one of which pertains to color grading. With this tool you can transfer the color palette from one image to another allowing you to replicate looks from films and other media.

It won't be news to anyone that colors are crucial to a final product save for black and white imagery and what you do in post-production often can change the whole feel of your work. I have always had an obsession with color decisions made in cinema — like many of us do — after seeing Amelie in my formative years.

I have never gone so far as to replicate the colors of a movie or television show but it isn't something that's unthinkable to me. While I would never use a tool like this to copy another photographer's work I can imagine creating portraits that are inspired by cinema. To further prove I am a generic person I love the general aesthetic of Drive for instance.

Escalating Demand for Air Rifles in APAC and MEA to Propel Air Gun Market Growth in Coming Years

The demand for air rifles is growing at a faster pace in APAC due to the increasing number of sports events and the mounting interest of citizens in animal hunting. The region offers immense scope for hunters to hunt stags gazelles bears roe deer etc. In Australia China Japan and Southeast Asian countries among others hunting is legal. For instance in Australia the hunting is regulated independently by each territory and state government which govern through different laws license requirement and fee and fine structures. In Japan the hunter should be 18 years and above to get a license for using air gun and projectiles (rifles and shotguns). Moreover several sports held in 2020 such as 2nd World Deaf Shooting Championships (June 2020) 2020 Summer Olympics 2020 Summer Paralympics and World and continental shooting events further propelled the market growth. The growing demand for air rifles across these countries with the increasing interest in hunting games and sports events is boosting the air gun market across APAC countries except India.

In the MEA the UAE and Africa are perceiving significant demand for air rifles for hunting purposes. The countries have different rules for the possession of air rifles which mainly depend on the caliber and muzzle energy of the guns. The UAE regulates somewhat lenient regulations than other countries in the region. Likewise in South Africa a valid hunting license must be issued from the relevant provincial authority which includes a permit authorizing for the usage of an air rifle for hunting. Thus APAC and MEA are creating huge opportunities for the air gun manufacturers to expand their foothold in these regions.

Air Gun Market: Product Type

Air guns are used as instruments for hunting and firearms training as well as toys in funfairs. Air gun is characterized into two types—rifles and pistols. These product types are also used in shooting events for 10 m air rifle and 10 m air pistol events. The increasing affordability of a high-power air gun has enabled large projectiles and longer target distance for the purpose of the competition. The demand for air rifles and air pistols is expected to rise with the increase in its adoption among individuals in the coming days with the growing number of sporting events including shooting events. In the Extreme Benchrest competition held in Arizona US air gun with calibers up to 0.35 inches are used for targets placed at a distance of 75 and 100 yards while the big-bore bench rest arm types of air gun in the same competition are used for targets placed at a distance ranging from 35 to 200 yards.

The pistols segment held the largest market share in 2019 as its demand is higher among air gun users owing to the affordable prices. However the trend of adoption of air pistols is anticipated to continue to surge and the segment is estimated to be the fastest growing during the forecast period. The stupendous growth rate of air rifles is majorly attributed to the rise in hunting and long range target shooting activities across various countries.

NeatCleats began as a simple metal bracket for hanging cycling shoes back in 2017 and now its new Align+ gives you the ability to measure and accurately align your clipless cycling cleat position as well as attach your shoes securely to the outside of a bag.

“Each pack comes with a calibration ruler to measure your lateral and vertical positioning of the cleat and also adjust your heel in and heel out position” NeatCleats explains.

This tool is designed to be used when replacing your cleats by using these measurements. It can also be used by those who want to fit the cleats onto a new pair of shoes says NeatCleats.

Refitting your cleats so they are in the appropriate position for you can make a huge difference to the fit and feel of your bike. Feeling comfortable as you ride won’t just make cycling a more pleasant experience it could also prevent injury and even benefit your performance.

NeatCleats uses a laser-cut steel plate which is said to be hardwearing and also easy to recycle. “Although we currently use plastic in the production of Neatcleats we have begun the switch to replace all plastic components over to wood-based or recycled plastics.

“By biocomposite/recycled plastic our goal is to go plastic-free by the end of 2022” says the brand.

Priced at £47.99 with the guide or £35.99 without there’s two versions currently available: one for Shimano SPD-SL cleats and Look Keo Grips while the other is for Wahoo Speedplay’s Zero Aero.

NeatCleats says Time iCliq and SPD Crankbrothers and Time ATAC versions will also be available by the end of 2021. The video below shows how to measure the current position of your clipless cycling cleats.

Driver shortages escalating ride-share fees government catfights and heavy food delivery competition may have taken a toll in the third quarter raising odds for an aggressive ‘sell-the-news’ reaction after Thursday’s post-close report when UBER is expected to post a 16-cent per-share loss.

Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied out of a deep basing pattern at 16 cents in August topping out at 35 cents a few weeks later. It posted a higher low in September and bounced once again nearly completing a 100% retracement into the prior peak on Thursday. The coin has been pulling back since that time but strong support around 25 cents should ease selling pressure setting up a potential buying thrust that may complete a cup and handle breakout pattern with an upside target just above 50 cents.

Watch Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) on Wednesday because the passage of President Biden’s massive infrastructure bill may depend on Tuesday’s hotly-contested gubernatorial election in Virginia. The sector has been trading in tandem with acrimonious negotiations for several months now rallying 31% in the last 19 trading days. A Republican victory may be viewed as a mandate against big government spending potentially shifting moderate Democratic votes to the ‘no’ column.

Ford Motor Co. (F) joined the EV bandwagon this year announcing a series of initiatives to compete with better positioned rivals Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and General Motors Co. (GM). The automaker beat Q3 expectations and raised 2021 guidance last week adding to an uptick that’s posted an impressive 94% 2021 year-to-date return. However the stock is now approaching resistance going back to 2011 raising odds for a reversal and decline that could last for weeks or months.

Mixing reality with an Alphabet soup | Mint,"New Delhi: There's a strong sense of deja vu about Mark Zuckerberg's ' Meta ' announcement. Six years back when Larry Page announced the launch of Alphabet he said upfront ""...in the technology industry where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant...Our company is operating well today but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company called Alphabet...""

Alphabet today is ""mostly a collection of companies"" the largest being Google. Declaring results for the quarter-ended 30 September Sundar Pichai CEO of Alphabet and Google said: “Five years ago I laid out our vision to become an AI-first company. This quarter’s results show how our investments there are enabling us to build more helpful products for people and our partners...""

When Zuckerberg made his Meta announcement on 28 October he said among other things ""Our mission remains the same — it’s still about bringing people together. Our apps and their brands aren’t changing either. We’re still the company that designs technology around people..."" While Meta Platforms Inc. (FB)'s corporate structure will not change the company plans to report on two operating segments -- Family of Apps and Reality Labs -- starting with the fourth quarter results of 2021.

However Zuckerberg unlike Page made no reference in his speech to ""a cleaner and more accountable"" company despite the numerous legal and privacy tangles that the company has been embroiled in and continues to grapple with in the US European Union and other parts of the world. For example Facebook's spat with whistleblower Frances Haugen a former data scientist at Facebook continues in the US courts. All he said was ""...This period has also been humbling because as big of a company as we are we’ve also learned what it’s like to build on other platforms. Living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry...""

Regardless of whether the 'Meta' name will alter the fortunes of Facebook valued currently at just over $900 billion the fact remains that the company needs a perception change -- from that of the world's largest social networking site to one is futuristic the way Google did with DeepMind.

Zuckerberg wants the new identity to be ""metaverse-first not Facebook-first"" (remember Google underscores AI-first and Meta cannot work without AI). This he explained means that over time you won’t need a Facebook account to use the company's other product and services. This simply means that users can be on Facebook Instagram Whatsapp or soon leap beyond all that with Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse entity called 'Meta'. During the first quarter of 2021 Facebook said 3.51 billion people were using at least one of its core products (Facebook WhatsApp Instagram or Messenger) each month according to Statista.

This is similar to how individuals and businesses can do a plain Jane search and leverage advertising with Google while investors can deal with an expensive Google parent called 'Alphabet' now valued at $1.97 trillion.

For now though the Meta brand is a work in progress. According to Zuckerberg the metaverse encompasses both social experiences and future technology. Going forward Zuckerberg hopes the metaverse ""will reach a billion people host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce and support jobs for millions of creators and developers"".

But how unique is the Metaverse to Facebook?

To begin it isn't. Many technology firms including Microsoft Nvidia and Fortnite maker Epic Games have been talking about their own visions of the metaverse for quite some time. In fact the term itself has been borrowed from Neal Stephenson’s 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash wherein the concept was used to describe a new kind of internet with virtual reality (VR).

And if you're a sci-fi movie buff you will recall Tom Cruise encountering interactive billboards and iris-triggered direct marketing in the film Minority Report that was released nearly 19 years back or Tony Stark as the Marvel Comics superhero in the movie Iron Man going a step further with his artificial intelligence (AI) partner Jarvis (just a very intelligent system) providing him with all the information he needs on holograms computers and also in Stark’s Iron Man suits.

Pokémon Go a free location-based augmented reality (AR) mobile game for iOS and Android smartphone users mixes online reality with the real world. It allows players to use GPS (global positioning system) and Google Maps on their smartphones to look for PokeStops at places such as public art installations historical markers and monuments where they can collect Poke Balls and other items. And like PokeStops Gyms can be found at real locations in the world—all this without users needing a virtual reality (VR) headset which indicates that AR technology is coming of age.

You may recall Second Life which can be said to be a different kind of metaverse within or beyond the Internet. Developed by San Francisco-based Linden Labs in 2003 this multi-player world became a craze digital when it allowed users to create their digital 3D avatars socialize with others play games and explore multiple worlds called Sims. While Facebook’s Metaverse is a VR and augmented reality (Mixed Reality that melds VR and AR with the real world) platform Second Life is a virtual online world that can be accessed on a PC. It also has a thriving marketplace where users can buy and sell merchandise property and services using a virtual currency called Linden dollar. Second Life’s user base reached a record high of 1.1 million monthly active users in 2013 and is currently believed to have 900000 active users.

Magic Leap founded in 2010 by Rony Abovitz went a step further. It was seen as one of the most promising companies in the field of mixed reality. Abovitz managed to create and sustain buzz around Magic Leap headsets for years without actually launching a product in the market. In 2018 US telco AT&T acquired stakes in the company and the first Magic Leap One headset was launched at AT&T stores the same year.

However Magic Leap One failed to live up to the hype and was a far cry from the tall promises made in their many demonstrations. Palmer Luckey who is best known as the founder of Oculus VR and designer of Oculus Rift (both owned by Facebook or Meta now) in a blog post titled 'Magic Leap is a Tragic Heap' called it a flashy hype vehicle that nobody can use in a meaningful way. Abovitz eventually stepped down in 2020 and Peggy Johnson a former Microsoft executive was appointed the CEO. In October 2021 Magic Leap raised $500 million in funding taking the total investments to up to $3.5 billion and announced that its next AR headset Magic Leap 2 will launch in 2022.

The craze around Second Life and Pokémon Go may have sure waned with time but the fact remains that technology companies like Microsoft with its HoloLens and US-based start-up Magic Leap Inc. are increasingly betting on the melding of technologies like AR and VR with the real world to give users and businesses a world of so-called “mixed"" reality (MR) or “blended"" reality concepts to deal with. The belief is that these technologies have the potential to become the next big computing platform.

While VR is all about a world created solely on computers or online AR still deals with the real world and has elements of the virtual world built atop it akin to layers of information. AR technology was envisioned by Ivan Sutherland who devised the first AR system in 1968 but the technology is blooming only now with customized applications in industrial automation theme parks sports television military displays and online marketing.

Jaron Lanier an American writer computer scientist and composer of classical music is credited with popularizing the term AR. He and Thomas G. Zimmerman left gaming firm Atari in 1985 to found VPL Research Inc. the first company to sell VR goggles and gloves.

Mixed Reality or MR as the name suggests mixes both realities in a bid to capture the best of both worlds.

To be fair Zuckerberg did say in his note that the metaverse will be a collective project that goes beyond a single company and that it will be created by people all over the world and open to everyone.

In September Facebook itself introduced Ray-Ban Stories--smart glasses that can capture photos and videos help you listen to music or take phone calls. Built in partnership with Facebook and EssilorLuxottica Ray-Ban Stories are already available in a few countries (but not in India). A month later Facebook announced a $10 million Creator Fund to ""encourage more people to come build with us as we continue rolling out Horizon in beta"". Facebook Horizon is a place to explore play and create with others in VR. Further Codec life-like Avatars from Facebook Reality Labs is another ongoing research project.

Microsoft too is betting big on its MR holographic computer which it christened HoloLens. HoloLens has sensors that allow you to use your gaze to move the cursor when you want to select holograms. You can use gestures to open apps select and size items and drag and drop holograms and use voice commands to navigate select open command and control the apps. You can also speak directly to the personal digital assistant Cortana.

Indian companies are having their own brush with mixed reality. In his 2014 campaign India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi used London-based Musion's 3D life-like holographic technology to address audiences in 128 locations simultaneously across India.

Mumbai-based VR startup Tesseract in which Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio has a majority stake is promising a mixed reality future like that with its Jio Glass Quark camera Holoboard headset and Jio Fiber. It is promising applications for both consumes and enterprises. For instance you could watch a football match on a VR headset that streams the match live and projects interesting stats on the fly with the help of augmented reality (AR). Similarly a Hyderabad-based mixed reality startup called Imaginate enables cross-device communication over VR and AR wearables for enterprise collaboration in the industrial sector.

All these examples underscore how Mixed Reality or MR is coming from the shadow sci-fi movies like Blade Runner 2049 where Officer K. played by Ryan Gosling develops a relationship with his AI hologram companion Joi. It indicates why MR is poised to be the next big computing platform.

Will that however help Facebook go beyond its past with Meta? Or will adding Meta to the Apple Amazon Alphabet or Google Microsoft Netflix and Tesla group only add more confusion to the Alphabet soup?

Firestick remote isn't working you should try resetting its connection to your device. Make sure that there's a clear path between your remote and the Firestick so they can connect.

Your Firestick remote's batteries might need to be replaced too.

With more and more people getting rid of cable television streaming devices like the Amazon Fire TV Stick (also known as the Firestick) are becoming more popular. And the Firestick is a great device - when it's working correctly.

If your Firestick's remote control stops working it means no movies and no TV. In some cases it might mean that you can't turn on your television at all.

Thankfully there are a variety of ways to fix a Firestick remote that's not working.

Quick tip: This article focuses on the Amazon Firestick but these steps should work for any Amazon Fire TV device.

How to fix your Firestick remote when it's not working

Change the batteries

It might seem too simple to work but hear us out. Your Firestick might be small but it uses power whenever you press a button. And over the course of a year that adds up.

Remove the battery cover on the back of your Firestick remote to remove the batteries and replace them with fresh ones. Most Firestick remotes take two AAA batteries.

Once you've replaced the batteries try using the remote again.

Remove any obstructions

Your Firestick remote might be wireless but it still needs space to connect with the Firestick. Make sure that there's nothing blocking your remote or Firestick like a game console or pile of books. Also move any nearby devices sending off radio signals like Wi-Fi routers or even microwaves.

For the best results there should be a clear line between your remote and the Firestick.

Unpair and reconnect the remote

If the batteries aren't the issue and you've got a clear line of sight your remote's connection to the Firestick might need a refresh. Unpairing the remote from your Firestick and re-pairing it might do the trick.

1. Use another Firestick remote to wake your Firestick and open the Settings menu. If you don't have another physical remote you can connect your iPhone or Android device and use that as a virtual remote.

2. In the Settings menu select Controllers & Bluetooth Devices and then Amazon Fire TV Remotes.

3. Scroll down to the remote that's not working - it'll probably just be called Amazon Fire TV Remote - and press the Menu button and then the Select button. Your remote will disappear from the list.

4. Scroll down and select Add New Remote then press and hold the Home button on the unpaired remote.

5. When the Firestick prompts you press the Select button on the ""old"" remote you used to navigate the menus.

Your Firestick will re-pair with the remote which will hopefully get it working again.

Reset the remote

If unpairing it didn't work you can try resetting the remote. This not only refreshes the connection but also restarts the remote's internal software and hardware.

The exact steps it'll take to reset your remote differ depending on what kind of remote you have so check out our full guide on how to reset your Firestick remote for more information. Basically you'll need to press and hold certain buttons on the remote and unplug the Firestick from its power source.

Reset your Firestick

While most connection issues stem from the remote there's always a chance that your Firestick is really the one causing problems. If none of the previous steps worked you can factory reset your Firestick.

Factory resetting the Firestick will erase all of its data returning it to the state it was in when you bought it. This means that you'll have to redownload your apps and log into your accounts. It's annoying but also a great way to fix issues.

Just note that you'll need to have at least one remote that can connect for this even if it's just the virtual remote in the Fire TV smartphone app.

1. Open the Settings menu on your Firestick and select My Fire TV.

2. Scroll down and select Reset to Factory Defaults then confirm your choice.

Give the device a few minutes to reset. Once it's done set it up like new.

Contact Amazon

If you've tried all these steps and your Firestick remote still won't work the problem probably runs deeper than you can fix. In this case contact Amazon directly for help.

Amazon's customer service representatives can help you with nearly any Fire TV issue. If even they can't figure out the problem there's a chance that they'll let you send in your Firestick for a replacement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9xLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTAvYW1hem9uLXJkcy1jdXN0b20tb3JhY2xlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Introduces RDS Custom for Legacy and Custom Oracle Databases,"Amazon recently announced RDS Custom a managed database service for legacy and custom applications that need access to the underlying operating system and database environment. RDS Custom for Oracle is the first available service.

Amazon RDS Custom automates setup operation and scaling of the databases while giving access to the underlying EC2 instance. Customers have access to the database and underlying operating system to configure settings install patches and enable native features an approach significantly different from a traditional RDS instance. Santosh Rao principal product manager at AWS comments:

Great milestone for customers who seek the best of both worlds in running a managed service and wanting more control and choice.

RDS Custom provides a monitoring service the support perimeter that ensures that the database instance runs on a supported AWS infrastructure operating system and database. All changes and customizations to the underlying Oracle Linux operating system are logged using Systems Manager and AWS CloudTrail. The new service currently supports Oracle Database Enterprise Edition engine running on Oracle Linux OS and targets customers and deployments that historically have not been able to move to a managed database service.

Source: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-rds-custom-for-oracle-new-control-capabilities-in-database-environment/

Channy Yun principal developer advocate at AWS highlights the markets that might benefit from the new option:

There are some legacy and packaged applications that require customers to make specialized customizations to the underlying database and the operating system (OS) such as Oracle industry specialized applications for healthcare and life sciences telecom retail banking and hospitality. Customers with these specific customization requirements cannot get the benefits of a fully managed database service like Amazon RDS and they end up deploying their databases on premises or on EC2 instances.

Using the RDS Custom option high availability database backups and software maintenance are not anymore fully managed but are under a shared responsibility model between the customer and the cloud provider. AWS documents how to connect to a RDS Custom DB instance using SSH or AWS Systems Manager.

Clay Moore AWS architect at Wipro hopes that Microsoft databases will be supported soon:

Now we need RDS Custom for MS SQL for those workloads that require SA access and I won't have to build any more SQL clusters on AWS.

As highlighted in the FAQ scaling of the DB instances is limited by the terms of the Oracle license and customers are responsible for maintaining a third-party support agreement for the database software. Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle is currently available in a subset of AWS regions including North Virginia and Ireland and runs under a bring your own license (BYOL) model. Pricing is different and more expensive than for equivalent traditional RDS instances.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy1vbi1hbWF6b24tcHJpbWUtdmlkZW8tbm92ZW1iZXItMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's What's New on Amazon Prime Video in November 2021,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy1vbi1hbWF6b24tcHJpbWUtdmlkZW8tbm92ZW1iZXItMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

There have been fires and explosions of CI flexo and gravure presses in the North the South and West also. In general these have been attributed to ‘poor housekeeping.’

The only plant in which I have seen discussion and training on fire safety was the Thomson Press commercial printing offset plant in Faridabad in the 1970s. Nevertheless there was a fire in the oven of its web offset heatset press in the plant in those days – which could have been because of the poor maintenance of the oven and also the general tendency of piling both dampening solution and ink on the papers substrates. This led to the continuous raising of oven temperature for curing the heavy layers of ink while printing.

There was an explosion in the oven of a heatset web press in Chennai about 20 years ago. About 15 years ago the entire building of a label press burned down on the main road in Noida – fire engines were there for several days. This is just to say that fires and explosions are a danger and hazard in all types of printing plants and they also happen at major brand owners processing and packaging plants – in fact industrial fires can happen in any process and setting where energy is used. Have you been involved in a car accident while driving for work? Read about the employer liability for employee car accident on Tingey Injury Law Firm’s website.

The flexible packaging industry is meant to be or should be organized. It routinely handles flammable plastic substrates prone to static electricity and discharges inks that are based on and diluted with volatile solvents and uses curing systems that are generally hot air ovens. And not just the pressroom since a new cast polypropylene CPP line and metallizer in India also caught fire recently.

Mantras for getting organized on safety

Flexible packaging experts say that the fire hazards in the industry start right at the top and result in a dismal amount of awareness seeping down to a lack of best practices awareness and training on the shop floor. There is great negligence in filling and pouring solvents in pressrooms that already contain significant amounts of evaporated solvent in the air around the print units. A small bit of static creates a spark and there is generally enough evaporated solvent to cause a fire. In less than a few seconds the film or laminate catches fire and carries it through the entire length of the press and burns it down. Just think – what better fuel for a fire than plastic films laminates inks and solvents?

The organized flexible packaging companies get it. Apart from following best practices and doing the training of the resources on the shop floor – companies such as Amcor Constantia Huhtamaki and Paharpur 3P generally use double static elimination systems and they also install cameras around the press to monitor both the housekeeping of stuff lying around and the safety behavior of the operators.

Best practices include following the ATEX Directives for workplace atmospheres and the safety and health of the workers. Apart from double static elimination systems CO2 flooding at each print unit of the press is becoming mandatory. If one has seen any of the live Kohli Industry Zoom demos of gravure presses in the past year one will notice that Kaku Kohli always highlights the CO2 flooding system on each unit.

Safety norms include making sure that the dryers should contain a negative pressure to evacuate air and solvent from the press and the plant. You cannot have migration of solvent into the plant and there should be an additional exhaust from the pressroom according to ATEX norms. One has seen such air evacuation and change systems in the newly built Constantia Ecolam plant in Ahmedabad.

Any component that can catch fire should be at least one and a half meters from a potential fire source. Explosion-proof motors are part of the CE norms and lastly flexible packaging business owners must buy presses that contain lower explosion limit (LEL) systems. The LEL systems shut off the press if the solvent limit in the atmosphere is exceeded at any of the print units. However the LEL systems can cost Euros 4000 to 5000 for each unit of an imported press and many of the press buyers avoid spending this ‘extra’ Euro 40000 to 50000 when buying a press – only to regret it later.

Supplies are so scarce that Pa.'s and N.J.'s electric grid operator is worried.,"A mountain of coal was removed from the Mercer Generation Station in New Jersey during its 2018 shut-down. In current markets coal stockpiles are running low at some power plants. Read more

Coal a pariah fuel for climate activists has made a quiet comeback this year in the post-lockdown economic resurgence. Coal stockpiles at power plants are getting so low that the regional electric grid operator PJM Interconnection has taken steps to prevent a system collapse this winter similar to Texas earlier this year.

PJM based near Valley Forge this month imposed new rules on power plants in 13 states and the District of Columbia to make sure electricity generators do not run short of fuel during a cold snap. The rules would allow some coal generators to curtail operations to build up emergency reserves increasing power prices already on the rise.

Demand for coal has jumped in response to rising natural gas prices even though coal emits more toxic and greenhouse gases per kilowatt hour generated than rival fuels. Coal-fired power plants have struggled to replenish stockpiles because the energy sector is facing the same kind of supply chain challenges that have slowed deliveries of many goods and commodities.

“Our top priority at PJM is ensuring a reliable electric grid” said Michael Bryson PJM’s senior vice president of operations. “We are especially concerned about coal supply chain issues and inventory levels heading into the winter.”

The resurgence of coal power even amid a worldwide push to promote clean energy and decarbonize electricity production demonstrates that fossil fuels still remain very much in the energy mix coal advocates say.

Policymakers need to recognize coal as “part of an all-the-above energy strategy for the foreseeable future because the coal fleet supports grid reliability and resilience helps keep electricity prices affordable provides fuel security and serves as an insurance policy when other electricity sources are not available or are too expensive” said Michelle Bloodworth chief executive of America’s Power a trade group for the coal industry.

But climate activists say coal generation is merely the short-term beneficiary of rising natural gas prices which have elevated coal’s place in the hierarchy of fuel choices facing grid operators which select generators based largely on price. Now is the time to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy they say.

“My sense is this is a blip” said Joseph Otis Minott executive director of the Clean Air Council. “In the long run the writing is on the wall for coal plants.”

Indeed coal’s share of the nation’s power-generation mix has fallen steadily in the last 10 years from 44% in 2011 to 20% last year according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Coal’s role was diminished by natural gas after production of inexpensive fracked gas soared in the last decade. Though natural gas is also a fossil fuel whose production and combustion emit greenhouse gases it was relatively easy for power generators to get permits to build new efficient gas-fired power plants because they emit far fewer toxic emissions than coal plants. Nationwide electricity generated from natural gas-increased from 23% in 2011 to 39% last year.

Coal has also lost share to renewable energy primarily wind and solar which have increased from 4% to 12% of the U.S. electricity generation mix in 2020 and are continuing to grow at a fast clip. Of 230 gigawatts of proposed new power generation awaiting approval to connect to the grid 90% of it is renewable energy said Jeffrey Shields a PJM spokesperson.

But with rising energy prices this year coal power has become more competitive in the short term. Federal energy officials estimate that coal power plants will generate about 170 billion kilowatt hours more electricity this year a 22% increase from 2020. Coal’s share of the nation’s power mix is expected to increase from 20% last year to 24% this year.

Coal stockpiles which in October stood at 86 million tons are down 35% from a year ago when 133 million tons were available going into winter according to the Energy Information Administration. Current inventories are 18% below the lowest level in the past five years and are projected to get as low as 61 million tons a year from now and not recover in 2022.

Coal producers including Pennsylvania’s Consol Energy Inc. whose share prices have soared this year telegraphed the growing demand months ago to investors.

“Inventories are I would say near critical levels for many of the domestic utilities that we do serve” Robert Braithwaite vice president of marketing for Consol told analysts in a conference call in August. “When I say critical levels I’m saying sub-10 days of inventory on the ground.”

Coal-fired power plants are running more frequently at a time when they normally would be stockpiling fuel for the winter said Bryson of PJM.

Replenishing stockpiles is more complicated than calling a broker and ordering a barge delivery. In the current topsy-turvy economy energy markets are encountering the same supply-chain disruptions that have upended manufactured goods ranging from furniture to new vehicles. The energy industry is dealing with shortages of transportation and labor including truck drivers railroad personnel and coal miners.

American producers of coal natural gas oil and propane are also facing increased demand for energy overseas particularly in China and India. China’s still-expanding coal fleet of 1080 gigawatts is as large as the entire U.S. electricity generation capacity combined including gas nuclear renewables and coal. China’s coal-power capacity is five times bigger than America’s coal fleet.

“It makes it very difficult for our generators to build their supplies in the way they’ve been comfortable building them in the past” said Bryson.

There is still plenty of coal in the ground. But coal producers say they are not incentivized by policy makers to invest in reliability. Bloodworth blamed “the lack of price signals that value fuel assurance and provide longer-term certainty for the coal industry necessary to ensure the entire supply chain can remain healthy and able to provide the reliable and resilient electricity when it is needed most.”

PJM said it attempted to address incentives with its temporary rules requiring coal generators to keep larger stockpiles on hand this winter.

Reliability in the grid has been a concern for many years Bryson said. After the infamous polar vortex in 2014 where heating demand soared power plants failed and electricity prices spiked dramatically PJM enacted new rules aimed at assuring that power generators honored their commitments to produce during extreme weather events. It adopted “capacity performance” rules to pay power producers to winterize their plants and fuel supplies and also enacted severe penalties on producers that failed to perform as promised.

Bryson said the latest rules for coal generators were developed after a severe winter storm knocked out more than 4 million Texas households in February. PJM planners began to model more extreme weather conditions.

“I know what demand is supposed to be like but what if the weather is colder? And it’s colder for a longer period of time and the generators are out at a higher rate or we have natural gas issues?”

Under the old rules PJM would move a power unit to what it calls “maximum emergency” status if its fuel supply dipped below 32 hours. That meant the plant could only operate during an emergency until it replenished fuel supplies.

With the new rules which are in effect through April the power grid can restrict a power producer from operating if its fuel stockpiles shrink below 10 days. A unit could remain offline until it built up a 21-day inventory of coal.

Bloodworth the spokesperson for coal generators said the PJM policy changes are a “good temporary solution” to ensure that power plants can readily support grid reliability and resilience. But she said the industry is urging PJM to adopt a long-term fix to compensate coal generators to keep sufficient stockpiles on hand to get through an emergency.

Bryson agrees that it’s too soon to write off fossil fuels if the nation is moving toward a “net-zero” carbon emission target by 2050.

“There’s an argument to be made that resources like coal and gas need to be around for transition as we get to higher and higher penetration of renewables” said the PJM executive. “It’s premature to get rid of them before we have enough renewables on the system to be able to serve the load. So from that perspective it means this situation may be there for a couple years.”

View the current offers here.

In the years before the pandemic I had a preflight tradition.

If I had access to an airport lounge before leaving to board my flight I would grab a copy of a newspaper to peruse while in the air. Or if an airline offered newspapers on board I would almost always take one.

In our era of digital devices it may seem counterintuitive. But I loved the feeling of being disconnected while up in the air -- all the while flipping pages of the day's top headlines.

Whenever I did this I would also distinctly recall a childhood memory that of my parents as they read the Chinese newspaper at the kitchen table on a weekend morning. The paper they read was in a text that felt familiar yet foreign at the same time.

That's all to say now as a 20-something adult I savor the opportunity to read something that's printed to feel the weight of a crisp piece of paper between my fingers. And there's a certain personal nostalgia it brings of a bygone era where life felt a bit more carefree.

So when I discovered that the recently-launched ""digital entertainment credit"" on The Platinum Card® from American Express also applied to physical print copies of The New York Times I eagerly signed up.

In the past I wrote about how the Platinum's digital entertainment credit -- applicable toward only four services -- could use a revamp to be more useful for the average consumer. While I still think this credit is far too limiting it actually has served my needs as an existing Times subscriber.

In our current COVID-19 era newspapers at airport lounges (and onboard cabins on international flights) feel like a relic of the past. Who knows if they will actually return to the airport setting or if QR codes and endless scrolling will forever replace the satisfying turn of a printed page.

But for now using my Platinum credit I at least have something that restores my print fascination. No it's not exactly like reading the paper at 30000 feet all the while occasionally glancing out the window at the world below.

Recently The Platinum Card® from American Express had some big changes that saw quite a few new benefits being added to the card in addition to an annual fee hike. One of those new changes was the addition of an annual $179 statement credit towards a CLEAR membership.

But now it seems American Express is extending the same offer to select Amex cardholders through Amex Offers.

What Is CLEAR?

If you’re not already familiar CLEAR uses your biometrics like your face iris or fingerprint to verify your personal identity making it possible for you to speed through both airport and sports venue security.

This means that at the airport you won’t need to wait in line for an ID check. In fact you won’t even need to remove your ID from your wallet. After verifying your identity at a CLEAR pod a CLEAR Ambassador will escort you through the dedicated CLEAR lanes to the front of the line of the TSA checkpoint.

Needless to say this can be a big time-saver when traveling through the airport even for those who already have TSA PreCheck as having a CLEAR membership will allow you to jump to the front the TSA PreCheck line as well.

Free CLEAR Membership Through Amex Offers

So if you don’t already have the Amex Platinum card which cards appear to be offering a CLEAR benefit through Amex Offers?

As of now it seems that targeted cardholders of either the American Express® Gold Card or the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card are able to enroll in this offer.

As an Amex Gold cardmember here is what the offer looks like on your account:

Those who enroll in the offer and use that enrolled card to pay for CLEAR will get 100% back as a 1-time statement credit. Keep in mind that the offer expires on October 30 2021 but your CLEAR membership is good for 1-year after activating so you might want to wait until you have some upcoming travel to use the offer to fully maximize your free year of membership.

Hot Tip: Not a cardholder of the cards mentioned but still interested in a free or discounted CLEAR membership? Check out the best credit cards and elite programs for the CLEAR expedited airport security program.

Final Thoughts

Although a CLEAR membership credit feels like a bit of a slight to Amex Platinum cardholders it is great news for any Amex Gold card or Hilton Aspire cardholder who doesn’t already have the Amex Platinum card. If that’s you then be sure to jump on this great offer before it expires at the end of October so that you can get an expedited security experience at select airports and stadiums!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vYXV0aG9yaXplZC11c2VyLWJvbnVzZXMtdmlhLXByZS1xdWFsaWZpY2F0aW9uLXRvb2wv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Authorized user bonuses via pre-qualification tool,"American Express has been offering good authorized user bonuses this year. My wife had a few offers in her account over the last several months that would periodically show up under her Amex Offers. Unfortunately they had mostly dried up and have no longer been showing up under her Amex Offers for the past month. However she noticed that a couple of the offers are now showing up under the prequalification tool.

In recent months my wife has seen additional cardholder bonuses on a few of her cards including:

Platinum Card: Get 20000 points when you add an additional cardholders and they spend $2000 in the first 6 months

Gold Card: Get 10000 points when you add an additional cardholders and they spend $1000 in the first 6 months

Everyday Preferred: Get 5000 points when you add an additional cardholders and they spend $1000 in the first 6 months

In each case she has seen those offers appear under her Amex Offers or sometimes at the top of the page for each card in her account. However in recent weeks she has only seen the Everyday Preferred card additional cardholders offer (sometimes under “useful links” to the right of the Amex Offers section on desktop).

She hasn’t seen the Platinum or Gold additional cardholders offers in recent weeks. Then she checked her “Pre-Qualified Credit Card Offers” by clicking the menu cards and then the pre-qualified section as shown below:

On that page the first couple of offers she saw were for adding authorized users to her Everyday Preferred and Platinum cards:

The Gold card offer was no longer showing.

She had previously completed the Platinum card offer earlier this year. The offer terms suggest that the offer is only valid for the first additional cardholder added. That said the offer disappeared after taking advantage of it and then it came back again so it may be possible to complete again (I don’t know yet but will know eventually). Remember that while most Platinum cards charge $175 for up to three additional Platinum cardholders you can add free additional Gold cardholders. That isn’t an Amex Gold card (no supermarket or restaurant bonus). The card comes with the Platinum card’s earning structure and without Platinum card benefits like Centurion Lounge access or Delta Sky Club access. The good news is that it is free to add and triggers the 20K bonus (again she previously completed the offer).

Keep in mind that there have also been great offers for additional cardholders on the Business Platinum card this year. I was just glad to know where to find these easy additional cardholder offers that had seemingly disappeared from the Amex Offers section.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3Jldmlldy1iZS1yZWxheC1zcGEtbGF4LXByaW9yaXR5LXBhc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Be Relax Spa LAX (Priority Pass),"I recently checked out the Be Relax Spa in Terminal 1 at Los Angeles International Airpot (LAX) a new addition to the Priority Pass lounge network. My recommendation: allow yourself plenty of time. But it’s a nice addition especially if you are flying on Southwest Airlines.

Be Relax Spa LAX Review

I was not flying from Terminal 1 (Southwest) though the TSA does not prohibit passengers traveling from other terminals from accessing Terminal 1. Just allow yourself plenty of time – it took me a good 15 minutes to walk from Terminal 1 to Terminal 7 then I had to re-clear security.

With a valid Priority Pass card you can enjoy one of the following four treatments:

30 minute Lounger Massage – (a US$35 value)

15 minute Lounger Massage plus Aromatherapy & O2 – (a US$35 value)

10 minute Head Massage plus Aromatherapy & O2 – (a US$38 value)

10 minute Foot Massage plus Aromatherapy & O2 – (a US$38 value)

I arrived hoping for a foot massage but the spa was busy and I was told the wait would be 90 minutes. However there were two massage chairs unoccupied and I was invited to use one of those instead which I did.

The staff was quite kind but at around 3:00pm two workers left leaving only one poor guy to deal with five people including four waiting for treatments. He was overwhelmed…

Note that American Express-issued Priority Pass cards are exempted from this benefit: unfortunately American Express only allows access to Priority Pass lounges not restaurants or experiences like this spa. Also no guests are permitted.

The spa is open daily from 6:00am to 11:00pm and advance reservations are not offered. You’ll find it airside in Terminal 1 next to Rock n Brew Restaurant (sadly a former Priority Pass restaurant).

If you don’t have Priority Pass or want additional treatments here is the price list:

Tipping is appropriate – 15-25%.

CONCLUSION

Worth your time? Probably not unless you have a lot of time to burn or are traveling from Terminal 1. However I will return at some point just so I can try a foot massage and when I do I will report back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dyYW5kLXJhcGlkcy8yMDIxLzEwL25hdGl2ZS1hbWVyaWNhbi10cmliZXMtYWNxdWlyZS10d28taG9sbGFuZC10cnVja2luZy1jb21wYW5pZXMuaHRtbNIBgQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ncmFuZC1yYXBpZHMvMjAyMS8xMC9uYXRpdmUtYW1lcmljYW4tdHJpYmVzLWFjcXVpcmUtdHdvLWhvbGxhbmQtdHJ1Y2tpbmctY29tcGFuaWVzLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Native American tribes acquire two Holland trucking companies,"HOLLAND MI -- The investment arms of two Native American tribes have teamed up to acquire a pair of trucking transportation companies.

But they face a tougher opponent off the field,"CNN —

Atlanta has long been called a Black Mecca but in the 1990s it was also known for something else: The home of some of the country’s baddest Black baseball superheroes.

Those Braves teams featured a colorful lineup of Black superstars: Fred “Crime Dog” McGriff speedy Otis Nixon two-way star Deion “Prime Time” Sanders and the dimpled chin of David Justice who was married to actress Halle Berry.

The Braves then were part of the heartbeat of Black Atlanta. Hip-hop artists wore their caps and legions of Black fans ushers and street vendors mingled with White fans at the team’s ballpark in a historic Black neighborhood near downtown.

But when the Rev. Michael Clayton Harris co-host of the Red & Rev. Sports Show attended a recent Braves game at Truist Park he sat in a crowd of overwhelmingly White fans in a predominantly White suburb while a soundtrack of mostly rock and country music played over the sound system.

“When you go to the game it has a Trump feel to it with the fan base” says Harris who is a pastor at Acts of Faith Baptist Church in Decatur a suburb of Atlanta. “It felt weird for the simple fact that I remember when the stands had a lot more Black people and a lot more were enticed to games because they had more representation.”

Harris’ experience demonstrates that one of the most fascinating storylines of the 2021 World Series is happening off the field. The Braves aren’t just playing the Houston Astros – they’re also battling a perception that the franchise has abandoned the city’s Black community.

I’ve lived in Atlanta for 30 years and I’ve long heard this talk in barbershops and sports bars. Some Black fans say the team has few if any African American players they can relate to. Others believe the team left Atlanta because its suburban White fans felt uncomfortable coming to games downtown where they were surrounded by Black people.

Atlanta once known as the “city too busy to hate” in recent years has been engulfed by racial turmoil: police shootings of Black men racial protests and clashes over voting rights. These tensions spilled over into the sports world this year when Major League Baseball pulled the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta to protest new state laws that make it more difficult to vote.

A World Series title usually brings a city together. But I wonder: Will this Braves’ championship begin to heal the rift with the city’s Black community?

Atlanta’s racial tensions go beyond sports

This question may be surprising because of the Braves’ history.

The franchise’s most famous and beloved player the late Hank Aaron was a hero in the Black community. He received racist taunts and death threats when he broke Babe Ruth’s home run record in 1974 but the Braves organization embraced Aaron as a symbol of racial reconciliation in his retirement.

Aaron’s jersey number 44 is carved into the outfield grass at Truist Park as a tribute to the Hall of Famer who died in January.

The Braves also hired Bill Lucas the first African American to run the player-personnel department of a Major League Baseball team.

But in recent years the city’s fan base has become more segregated. The NBA’s Atlanta Hawks and the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons are seen by many as the “Black teams” while the Braves are increasingly known as the “White team.”

The Braves seem aware of this rift. When I contacted them this week about the Braves’ relationship to the Black community team officials sent me a 1600-word bullet-point response detailing all their efforts to promote racial diversity: being the first MLB team to create a diversity and inclusion department; creating foundations and career days to recruit players and front-office talent from historically Black colleges; and offering an array of community programs to promote baseball in Atlanta’s Black neighborhoods among others.

But bullet points can only go so far when the tension between the Braves and some of its city’s Black residents goes beyond sports.

Part of this is a byproduct of the city’s tense racial and political climate. Consider any explosive racial issue you can think of – White flight voter suppression racial protests the killings of Black people on video – and it has somehow detonated in Georgia in the past few years.

A White police officer killed Rayshard Brooks a Black man in an Atlanta parking lot last year only weeks after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparking protests and the resignation of Atlanta’s police chief.

Three White men are now on trial for the killing Ahmaud Arbery a Black man in February 2020 while he was jogging in a coastal city in south Georgia.

And in March over furious protests by Black voters and Democrats the Republican-led Georgia legislature passed one of the nation’s most racially restrictive voting laws.

The Braves ‘Tomahawk chop’ is getting political

Sports and politics aren’t supposed to mix. But Georgia’s current Republican governor ignored that adage during the Braves’ playoff run this season.

After the Braves won the National League pennant Gov. Brian Kemp criticized MLB’s decision to move the All-Star Game while attacking Stacey Abrams the Black voting rights advocate and a political rival.

Kemp tweeted: “While Stacey Abrams and the MLB stole the All-Star Game from hardworking Georgians the Braves earned their trip to the World Series this season and are bringing it home to Georgia. Chop On and Go @Braves.”

Kemp’s “Chop On” reference only served to highlight the Braves’ problematic “Tomahawk chop” symbol and gesture which some Native American groups and activists say perpetuates “dehumanizing” racial stereotypes.

Former President Donald Trump injected himself into the controversy Saturday night when he appeared at Game 4 of the World Series and did the Tomahawk chop from his Truist Park suite. Images of a smiling Trump chopping away flanked by exuberant White fans doing the same won’t help the Braves’ relationship with the city’s Black community or their White allies.

Critics have long demanded that the Braves eliminate the chop and change their team name – as the former Cleveland Indians did earlier this year – from one seen by many as a racial slur.

Some have suggested the Braves change their name to the “Hammers” to honor “Hammerin’” Hank Aaron’s nickname.

Last summer the Braves said they were reviewing use of the chop which is traditionally done by fans at the ballpark to rally the team.

But the Braves have so far resisted a name change saying in a 2020 letter to season ticket holders that “We will always be the Atlanta Braves” and citing the team’s relationship with regional Native American groups.

To some fans especially after the racial reckoning over George Floyd this stance seems racially insensitive.

A lesson from the Atlanta Hawks

Even Atlanta’s sprawling geography contributes to this rift between the Braves and the city’s Black community.

The city of Atlanta is 51% Black but many suburbs in places like Kennesaw and East Cobb County are predominately White. As someone who has worked in downtown Atlanta for more than 20 years I’ve seen a racial divide in the city’s fan base.

The crowds for Falcons and Hawks games in the city’s downtown are filled with Black and brown faces. But the throngs of Braves fans who passed through on their way to Turner Field were noticeably whiter. And some White fans looked palpably nervous as I watched them navigate Black crowds on their way into the Hawks’ arena and Falcons’ stadium.

Talking openly about these racial optics is what got a former owner of the Hawks in trouble not too long ago.

Bruce Levenson the former majority owner of the Hawks sold his interest in the team in 2014 and apologized after emails he sent to other Hawks executives went public.

Levenson said crowds at the Hawks’ arena were “70 pct black” and that they “scared away the whites.”

One writer said Levenson’s sentiments were not unique in the Atlanta sports world.

“This message that the Hawks owner apologized for delivering—that white fans are more valuable than black ones—is the exact one the Atlanta Braves have been broadcasting for the last several years” Robert Weintraub wrote in an essay for Slate.

Add these elements together and a perception has hardened among Black residents that the Braves don’t cater to them says Nubyjas Wilborn an Atlanta native and sportswriter who covered the Braves from 2016 to 2018.

“There are people who believe that the Braves are for straight Christian White people” says Wilborn who writes for AL.com.

The many challenges facing the Braves

One of the biggest obstacles the Braves face in erasing that perception is a primary cause for the rift: the team’s decision to move to a predominantly White suburb for the 2017 season.

Team officials said at the time that they left Turner Field downtown because there wasn’t enough parking and reliable mass transit. The Braves now play in Cobb County near a constellation of primarily White suburbs north of Atlanta.

The move reminded some of a big-league version of “White flight” the historical pattern from the 1960s and 1970s in which White residents fled urban neighborhoods across the country for the suburbs when Blacks moved in.

Yet for anyone who knows Atlanta saying the Braves moved to a conservative White community is overly simplistic. Cobb County the Braves’ new home is becoming more racially diverse – and is now a majority Democratic county.

It’s also unfair to say the Braves’ challenges with race are unique to them. It’s true that the Braves’ World Series roster includes several Afro-Latino players but just one African American: reserve outfielder Terrance Gore.

But few Black athletes are playing Major League Baseball in 2021. The presence of Black players in the majors peaked in 1981 at 18.7% according to the Society for American Baseball Research. On Opening Day this year it was 7% the group said.

There are several reasons for this shift. More Black athletes are going into football and basketball because it’s less expensive to play and more college scholarships are available. And some Black players say they feel isolated in MLB clubhouses.

Harris says the scarcity of African American players on the Braves is part of a bigger issue.

“What the Braves are dealing with is not just an Atlanta problem – it’s a major league problem” he says.

What this Braves title could do for the city

Winning it’s been said cures everything.

A Braves World Series title may not heal all wounds with Atlanta’s Black community but it may help the team recapture some fan loyalty from an earlier era.

“Sports is the great melting pot” says Gerald A. Griggs first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP and a self-described Braves fan “since I could walk.”

“When you have the opportunity to talk about something other than the things that divide us it’s a great opportunity. African American fans like winners. If they win a championship I think a large majority of the metro Atlanta area which is diverse will start to come together and support the team.”

Where the Braves hold their victory parade could also be key. When the team last won a championship in 1995 they celebrated with a parade in downtown Atlanta. I was a bystander. The crowd looked like a mini rainbow coalition as Black White and brown fans lined up to cheer the players.

If the team holds a victory parade downtown this year instead of in Cobb County it could send a signal to Black Atlanta that the Braves haven’t forgotten them says Harris the sports talk-show host.

“Sports definitely can be used as a healing agent” he says. “It would show a lot of character for the Braves to go and connect with the Black community especially when they’re on top.”

If that happens this World Series may be memorable for something other than an athletic triumph. The Braves would no longer be such a symbol of the city and state’s racial divisions.

They would become part of the solution.

That kind of victory won’t be as dramatic as a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. But in a city and a region in desperate need of racial healing it would still be a grand slam.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjEvYnVzaW5lc3MvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtamV0Ymx1ZS1hbnRpdHJ1c3QuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines and JetBlue Face Antitrust Suit Over Alliance (Published 2021),"The Justice Department filed an antitrust suit on Tuesday against American Airlines and JetBlue saying a growing alliance between the two carriers had created a “de facto merger” in the New York and Boston markets reducing competition and hurting consumers.

The suit said the arrangement between the airlines reduced the incentive for them to compete in the Northeast and elsewhere and would “cause hundreds of millions of dollars in harm to air passengers across the country through higher fares and reduced choice.”

“This sweeping partnership is unprecedented among domestic airlines and amounts to a de facto merger” the Justice Department declared. It said attorneys general in six states and the District of Columbia were joining in the lawsuit.

The action is the latest effort by the Biden administration to increase competition and limit the power of large companies through antitrust actions.

ATC had recently obtained the majority stake of Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Ltd (KTBL). KTBL is a sister concern of Confidence Group - a local conglomerate.

KTBL is now planning to invest around US$1 billion in the wireless tower infrastructure of the country said the company source.

Confirming the share transfer to the American Tower Confidence Group Director Salman Karim told The Financial Express that KTBL was now aiming to either purchase or build around 11000 to 12000 towers.

As KTBL can't purchase all towers due to some regulatory guidelines it is going to buy as many as possible he added.

In 2018 the telecom regulator issued licences to four companies - Edotco Bangladesh Company Summit Towers Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh and AB Hightech Consortium - to build lease and operate telecom towers in the country.

Transcend Infrastructure Holdings a subsidiary of American Tower was the partner of KTBL when it received the licence back in 2018. With the new move ATC now formally owns a major stake in KTBL.

As the market continues to evolve with the expansion of 4G network and 5G in the offing both build-to-suit (BTS) and sale-and-leaseback opportunities for tower companies exist.

Presently Bangladesh's tower market comprises around 40000 sites with the majority of those sites still held by the wireless carriers particularly by Grameenphone and Banglalink.

Robi currently owns 2470 towers. In 2015 the operator had sold off 5258 towers to Edotco Ltd for $250 million.

Both Robi and Banglalink are now looking for prospective buyers for their towers industry insiders said.

Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted licences to these four tower companies allowing them to operate for an initial period of 15 years with the possibility to extend this term incrementally by five years.

Of them Edotco has a portfolio of around 12000 towers and it manages different sites in Bangladesh. The company has around 11000 towers of its own and 1000 managed towers primarily for wireless carrier Robi Axiata.

Edotco has added an average of 500 towers to its portfolio.

AB Hi Tech owns 250 and Summit Tower owns nearly 500 towers according to the industry statistics.

KTBL now has less than 100 towers but Confidence Group Director Salman Karim said by the end of the year they would have around 300 towers.

As ATC joins KTBL it is now planning to invest around $1 billion he added.

In a further mature market Mr Karim said the number of total towers will come down to around 30000 as the available tower infrastructure will be shared by all operators.

""So with the four companies in the market KTBL can't hold even half of the towers of the total due to regulations"" he said.

""So the scope is limited"" said Mr Karim adding that KTBL was going to use investment facilities as much as it could.

According to a report titled 'Telecom Tower Market - Forecasts from 2021 to 2026' the global telecom tower market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.04 per cent over the forecast period to reach a market size of $105.262 billion in 2026 from $74.038 billion in 2020.

Telecom Tower Market refers to the infrastructure provided by the telecom players under the private ownership shared infrastructure service or as a joint venture to provide the services of connection or data to the wide audience.

The telecom tower infrastructure carriers operated on the model of finding the property to install the tower at the reasonable price having permits arranged and constructing the facility on behalf of the telecom companies in return for a rent.

This modus operandi has remained for a substantial period under the telecom tower space with the intent of increasing the customer base said the report.

The sector has witnessed a growth in terms of service streams to mobile connections broadband internet and others.

However despite such advancements at the global level there are three billion people across the globe remaining unconnected to telecommunications said the telecom tower market report referring to IFC reports.

This calls for the last mile connectivity programmes from telecommunications service and tower infrastructure providers.

With the change in the market dynamics the telecom tower companies are now motivated to undertake the route of digital transformation with advancement in technology to 5G growing competition altering the tower specifications and increasing rural markets customer base the report added.

Situated between two smokestacks that helped power Winston-Salem for nearly a century and in the center of Innovation Quarter Bailey South aspires to bridge the gap between the city’s heritage and future ambitions. The familiar smokestacks built in 1926 and 1946 frame a new six-story brick-and-glass building that encapsulates remnants of the original power plant. The development was built on a former parking lot power substation and credit union. It now includes a six-story building that is 95% leased by tenants such as The Variable Marketing firm Black Mountain Chocolate and three restaurants. Within the atrium of Bailey South a hole was left open to one of the smokestacks and lights placed within it for passers-by to peek inside. The surrounding Innovation Quarter district is home to about 170 companies and their 3700 employees and 1800 Wake Forest University students. The development has nearly 2 million square feet of office laboratory and educational space.

Bailey South developer Front Street Capital is a Winston-Salem-based company that has other real-estate investments in the Triad Atlanta Greenville S.C. and Memphis. “Real estate continues to define what a community’s perception of itself is” says Coleman Team a Front Street Capital partner and the son of Managing Partner Robin Team a veteran N.C. developer. “Bailey South is a dynamic and energy-creating asset intended to bring the community into Innovation Quarter … [and] give a glimpse towards where Winston-Salem is going.”

Variable President David Mullen says Bailey South can be a game-changer for downtown Winston-Salem and Innovation Quarter. “We wanted our fingerprints to be a part of it. It’s an incredibly special development from the overall building design to the design of our top two floors to the proximity of amazing outdoor spaces restaurants and entertainment options” he says. “It helps us attract incredibly talented people from across the country to join The Variable and fosters amazing collaboration and work-from-office options for our team.”

GRAFENWOEHR Germany – U.S. Army Garrison Bavaria community members got into the holiday spirit at the USO Grafenwoehr Halloween Spooktacular program hosted on Oct. 30 at the Tower Barracks Exchange Complex.

Participants enjoyed truck-or-treating face painting dancing a photo booth Halloween themed coloring prizes a costume parade and community connectivity.

To help make this event happen organizations and individual families from across the garrison volunteered with USO Grafenwoehr to host an array of decorative trunks. Furthermore each station prepared several thousand pieces of candy to distribute among the young trick-or-treaters.

According to USO Grafenwoehr Center Manager Gabe Foist his organization purchased more than twice the amount of candy for this year’s event compared to 2019.

“I think this event is a fantastic opportunity for USAG Bavaria community members to come together and engage in something that we previously couldn’t last year due to COVID-19” said Foist. “We’ve made a lot of changes – like hosting the main trunk-or-treat lineup outside and providing hand sanitizer at the stations – to ensure a safe responsible event for everyone to enjoy!”

USAG Bavaria Garrison Commander Col. Christopher Danbeck also joined the festivities to lead the official costume parade alongside his children. He was donning a “fancy ketchup” costume.

As the event wrapped up USO Grafenwoehr awarded door prizes to guests. And based on popular vote community members decided on the best decorated trunks:

First Place – Service Credit Union | World First Candy ATM Trunk

But most businesses aren’t run by Donald Trump.

When a deluge flooded the Trump Organization’s Westchester County New York golf course and a nearby town in 2011 the organization used a wildly inflated claim to score an insurance payout of nearly $1.3 million pulling in far more than what it spent to repair the course two people tell Rolling Stone. The previously unreported insurance claim at Trump National Golf Club in the Village of Briarcliff Manor far outstripped the cost to repair the damages which were about $130000 to $150000 one of the sources says.

One of the sources a former Briarcliff employee says superficial repairs were made to the damaged parts of the course. “The work was never completed” the former employee says. “They basically Band-Aided it.” The Trump Organization had sought even more than the nearly $1.3 million that was paid out but the insurer withheld a portion because the Trump Organization failed to produce the required receipts the other source says.

Both sources have direct knowledge of the Trump Organization’s operations and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to compromise ongoing investigations. Neither source who spoke to Rolling Stone knew the name of the underlying insurer of the Briarcliff course because all claims were handled through a brokerage service Aon Risk Services. Aon and the Trump Organization both declined to name the underlying insurer.

Questions around the claim could spell more legal trouble for a Trump Organization already eyeball-deep in lawsuits and investigations. The Westchester County District Attorney’s Office has opened a criminal investigation into financial dealings at Trump’s Briarcliff club. The New York Times which first reported the investigation said it appears to be focused at least in part on whether the Trump Organization misled local officials about the value of the property to reduce its taxes. The newspaper noted that the full scope of the inquiry could not be determined. (Jess Vecchiarelli a spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office declined to comment.) In the course of legal wrangling over an attempt to obtain Trump’s tax returns a federal judge in 2019 noted that the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and other law-enforcement authorities in the state are investigating “alleged insurance and bank fraud by the Trump Organization and its officers.”

Editor’s picks

A Trump Organization representative in an emailed statement says the organization was “not aware” of any investigation into the Briarcliff claim or any other. “Nor should there be an investigation” the representative wrote. “The insurance claim at issue was amicably resolved more than a decade ago following a series of well-chronicled storms across Westchester County that dumped more than five inches of rain on the Village of Briarcliff Manor causing extensive damage and flooding at the golf course and surrounding areas.”

The organization’s alleged insurance shenanigans at Briarcliff may help explain how the Trump Organization year over year took in more from insurance than it paid out in premiums. One of the sources said the company would routinely gather overinflated repair estimates often from members of Trump’s clubs that could be used to justify insurance claims. In a conversation with top company officials the source learned that the Trump Organization calculated that it got more than $2 back from insurers for every dollar it paid in — a return of more than 100 percent. Broadly the source says the company viewed insurance not as an expense but rather as an ongoing source of profit.

Even within the Trump Organization’s broader legal morass the Briarcliff payout stands out. The organization not only made a hefty profit off of the flood per the two sources it did so after a series of moves that increased the damage both to the golf resort and to its neighbors according to a lawsuit. The Village of Briarcliff Manor alleged that the Trump Organization improperly modified a series of course features that were aimed at controlling flooding breaking the rules for aesthetic reasons an accusation the Trump Organization denied.

After the storm the village cited the course over modifications to grassy basins that had been designed to catch excess rainwater but were turned into ponds. Those ponds were unhelpful when the June 23 2011 storm dropped five inches of water on the course and the rain spilled over into a massive flood according to a lawsuit the village filed in 2014. In the lawsuit the Village of Briarcliff blamed these “illegal and intentional modifications” along with the club’s failure to maintain the stormwater system for flooding that caused nearly $250000 in damage. The village which lies at the foot of a hill below the course saw its recreation center and historical society both located in the local library damaged by flooding and the local swimming pool and athletic fields were submerged below several inches of water. A geyser of water shot from a manhole after its cover popped off when the drainage system was clogged with rocks and debris. The village demanded the Trump Organization pay for damage estimated at more than $238000. “The failure of the Trump stormwater facilities to perform as designed was the sole direct cause of the village damage” the village claimed in its suit.

The Trump Organization disagreed and disavowed any responsibility for the flooding. Before the suit Specialty Risk Services LLC a third-party administrator had denied the Village of Briarcliff’s insurance claim against Trump’s golf club finding that the flooding was due to an extreme “300-year event” according to a letter obtained under New York’s Freedom of Information Law. (In its subsequent lawsuit the village maintained that the rainfall did not exceed the amount the course’s stormwater system was designed to handle.) Scott Blough a former superintendent at Trump’s golf course tells Rolling Stone that the club was not to blame for the flooding saying the erosion had all occurred in a ravine off the golf course and he was unaware of any problems with the drainage basins. “From what I understood everything was working properly” Blough says.

The Trump Organization ultimately paid the town $50000 to settle the lawsuit but under the terms of the settlement did not admit any wrongdoing according to a copy of the settlement obtained in a request made under New York’s Freedom of Information Law. The settlement came on July 12 2016 a few days before Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president.

The allegations about the insurance claim could add to the former president’s mounting legal problems. The Trump Organization and its chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty in what one prosecutor called a “sweeping and audacious” scheme to evade taxes on perks that should have been declared as income. Authorities in Georgia have opened a separate criminal investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the state’s election results and the Attorney General for the District of Columbia announced a criminal investigation into the former president’s activities on Jan. 6. Trump also faces a host of civil complaints. And then there’s the Westchester County DA’s investigation.

As is often the case with Trumpworld the allegations about the insurance claim pull in a rotating cast of characters with long-standing ties to Trump and legal woes of their own including former Trump caddy Dan Scavino and onetime bodyguard Matthew Calamari.

In a 2007 deposition Donald Trump testified that when it comes to dealing with insurance claims he relies “mostly” on Calamari the Trump Organization’s fiercely loyal chief operating officer. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office is looking into whether Calamari received tax-free benefits as part of its investigation into the former president’s company.

Calamari’s attorney Nicholas Gravante Jr. says his client has neither been contacted nor subpoenaed by any New York authorities regarding anything related to insurance claims adding that all of Calamari’s “duties at the Trump Organization have always been performed lawfully and ethically.” Responding to allegations that his client acted improperly with insurance claims Gravante says: “Tell whoever the coward is who is anonymously feeding you this false information to come out of the woodwork and attach their name to it. I’ll look forward to suing them for defamation on Mr. Calamari’s behalf.”

A representative for the Trump Organization declined to respond on the record about whether Calamari and Scavino were involved with the Briarcliff insurance claim.

According to two sources Scavino the general manager of the golf course at the time would have been well-aware of the modifications to the course’s stormwater system as well as the claim for damage from the 2011 storm. Scavino another die-hard Trump loyalist was a 16-year-old caddy at the Briarcliff club in 1990 when he got to carry Trump’s golf bag. In 2015 he joined the Trump campaign and served as White House director of social media and a deputy chief of staff. Scavino did not respond to a message left on his phone and one of his social media accounts.

One of the sources provided a specific example of the Trump Organization wringing money out of an insurer. As part of the 2011 claim at the Briarcliff club the company asked its insurer to cover the cost of replacing a torn lining in a man-made pond at the Briarcliff club. The Trump Organization insisted that replacing the torn lining would be an expensive process. It would involve draining a large pond and then removing and replacing the damaged liner. But all along the source says Trump’s company had a far cheaper repair in mind: Instead of draining the water a worker was sent into the pond with scuba gear to patch the lining a fix that had an estimated cost of less than $1000.

The nearly $1.3 million payout at the Briarcliff club was not the first time that the Trump Organization may have profited from an excessive insurance payout in the wake of a weather-related disaster. Six years earlier in 2005 Trump received a $17 million payout for hurricane damage to Mar-a-Lago the former president’s members-only club and current home in Palm Beach Florida. The Associated Press reviewed property records interviewed the adjuster who handled the claim and spoke with Trump’s butler at Mar-a-Lago. The AP ultimately concluded that there was “little evidence” of large-scale damage to the property.

Trump’s insurance policies also came up in 2007 when he was deposed in a $5 billion defamation lawsuit he filed against author and journalist Tim O’Brien. In that deposition Trump said that under the terms of his “very good insurance policy” he was not required to repair damage to his properties. “We didn’t have to spend anything under the policy as I understand it” Trump said.

Pamela Newman Trump’s longtime insurance broker at Aon handled the claim at Trump’s Westchester course and personally surveyed the damage according to two sources. Newman also handled the 2005 claim for hurricane-related damage at Mar-a-Lago. In his 2007 deposition Trump said Newman and her associate Regina Degnan “did the entire settlement with the insurance companies” for the Mar-a-Lago claim. Newman did not respond to an email or a text message left seeking comment.

Trump was one of Newman’s “largest clients” according to a glowing 2011 profile of the insurance broker broadcast on PBS’ Nightly Business Report. Newman holds the distinction of being the first person to contribute to Trump’s presidential run. She retired from Aon in 2017 and was appointed a civilian aide to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy representing southern New York.

The former president’s relationship with Newman may raise red flags according to an analysis of Trump’s legal troubles produced in June by the Brookings Institution. The report noted the close relationship “may raise questions for investigators as to how closely the broker scrutinized any false statements Trump may have made or whether she was duped by him” the report stated adding that it may turn out nothing was amiss.

In 2019 New York regulators subpoenaed Aon for documents relating to the company’s dealings with Trump and the Trump Organization according to The New York Times. (Aon was reportedly not a target of the investigation.) Aon which declined to comment for this story has said it intends to cooperate with investigations into the former president and his company. In addition to serving as the Trump Organization’s insurance broker Aon was paid more than $2 million for providing insurance services to the Trump campaign Federal Election Commission records show. The city of Cleveland paid Aon $9.5 million for consulting services and a policy covering the 2016 GOP convention.

Trump said that Aon’s Newman was there for him whenever there was a flood a fire or any other problem at one of his properties. “There’s something about Pam where she just gets in there and kicks ass” Trump told Nightly Business Report not long after the Briarcliff storm that yielded his company a seven-figure payout. “She’s all right.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmxvY2t0b24uY29tL2diL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbG9ja3Rvbi1yZS13ZWxjb21lcy1zaW1vbi1tb29yZS1hbmQtamFtZXMtYm9vbi10by1pdHMtbm9uLW1hcmluZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockton Re welcomes Simon Moore and James Boon to its' Non-Marine Retrocession and Property Specialty Division,"LONDON 5th November 2021 - Lockton Re the global reinsurance business of the world’s largest privately held independent insurance broker is pleased to announce that Simon Moore and James Boon have joined the Non-Marine Retrocession and Property Specialty division in London as part of Lockton Re’s growing global platform.

Companies had kicked off discussions around the need to change salary structures as many people had relocated to smaller towns and hometowns away from office headquarters as remote work was expected to continue in some form in the hybrid work model. However HR services firm Aon and prominent recruiter Randstad India said hybrid work hasn't sparked off actual revision in salary structures by companies.

Leading firms like Kotak Mahindra Bank Axis Bank and Tata Consumer Products also confirmed that they are not changing their compensation structure because of hybrid work. Even though hybrid and remote work was touted as the future of work at the peak of the pandemic employers veered more towards calling employees back to offices once the heath crisis began abating.

""We will have to see by March 2022 how much of the hybrid model is taking off. Maybe WFH (work from home) remains as an option but most people come back to office. If the hybrid format does remain in some companies it is unclear if they will really go to the effort of creating separate cost structures for the hybrid work employees"" said Aon's partner for human capital business Roopank Chaudhary.

Besides the long-delayed labour codes are also expected to be implemented in the upcoming year.



""Companies are thinking about the labour code implementation and are waiting for it to be formalised. It will prescribe how companies calculate base salary and PF contribution for employees"" said Randstad India MD and CEO PS Viswanath.

Amid this it is unlikely that companies will complicate their salary structures further added Chaudhary.

The government has proposed four labour bills -- Wage Code Industrial Safety and Welfare Social Security and Industrial Relations -- to rationalise 44 central labour laws.

Some of its provisions include statutory floor-level minimum wage and provision of gratuity based on the new wage definition which caps allowances at 50 per cent of the wages. The rules are expected to increase the cost burden for companies which are emerging from a financially taxing year-and-a-half of pandemic.

The Labour Ministry has finalised the rules under the four codes. However both the Centre and the states have to notify the rules under these codes to convert them into laws as labour is a concurrent subject. The states are in various stages of progression on the codes.

The experts however added that the pandemic has certainly led to more companies including health and wellness insurance as part of employee benefits. There is also more emphasis on variable pay they said.

Wozniak Says That He Will Hang Onto His iPhone 8 for the Time Being

After getting the new iPhone 13 Wozniak said the following about the latest handset.

“I got the new iPhone; I can’t tell the difference really. The software that’s in it applies to older iPhones I presume. I worry about largeness and size ... but I don’t study it. I’m just into if products are good.”

In many ways the iPhone 13 series is indistinguishable from the iPhone 12 and you will have to look very carefully to notice that Apple added a smaller notch to the four new models while also making them thicker and heavier than the ones released last year. It is likely that he returned his latest iPhone 13 to an Apple store outlet as he says that he is happy with his iPhone 8 stating that it looks the same as an iPhone 7 and iPhone 6.

“I’d rather wait and watch that one. I’m happy with my iPhone 8 — which is the same as the iPhone 7 which is the same as the iPhone 6 to me.”

Back in 2017 Wozniak might not have been too taken with the iPhone X as he told reporters that he would not be purchasing the flagship on the first day of its release. He did however praise the Apple Watch calling it his favorite piece of technology so his impression about the company is not all that bad. He also mentions that he wants to see a foldable iPhone but given the state of this smartphone type it looks like his dream may not come true for a while.

If Wozniak thinks there is no difference between the iPhone 13 and the latest models perhaps he will get excited about the iPhone 14 series. After all the top-tier model the iPhone 14 Pro Max is rumored to get a redesign sport a punch-hole front-facing camera Titanium chassis and massive camera upgrades. Hopefully he is not too disappointed with what is announced in 2022.

This was a busy week for Apple legal. They filed a series of trademark applications in the U.S. and Hong Kong for various versions of AirTag. Apple also filed for two additional trademarks in Hong Kong covering ShazamKit and ""All Access."" Further Apple filed for the ""A15 Bionic"" trademark and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Apple a certificate of registration for their latest version of ""MagSafe"" that will cover MagSafe 3 which they applied for originally in October 2020.

A Series of ""AirTag"" Trademarks

Apple filed for a series of five trademark applications covering figurative and non-figurative versions of ""AirTag"" in the U.S. with an additional four applications for this same trademark filed in in Hong Kong. Below is an image of an application in-part covering just one of their applications filed with the U.S. Patent Office this week.

(Click on image to Enlarge)

AirTag Figurative trademark filing #97091212 was filed on October 25 under international claim 018 covering ""Leather carrying cases leather straps leather key cases luggage tags.""

The ""figurative"" version of the trademark included the bitten Apple as presented in the image found in Apple's trademark application.

Apple Specimen

The U.S. Patent Office defines a specimen as being an example of how a company is actually using their trademark in the marketplace with the goods or services in their application. It's what consumers see when they are considering whether to purchase goods or subscribe to services that Apple provides in connection with their trademark.

Below is the specimen supplied by Apple to USPTO showing the retail box of a Leather Loop with the figurative Apple AirTag trademark they're filing for.

Based on extensive research and nearly 100 interviews the report examines California’s economic footprint in Israel Israel’s economic presence in California key technologies where that activity is focused and future opportunities for collaboration.

Built on shared values and aligned interests the relationship between California’s Silicon Valley and Israel’s Silicon Wadi is reflected in growing venture investment large-scale acquisitions of Israeli companies successful Israeli-founded unicorns and public companies in Silicon Valley and extensive corporate and binational R&D.

“Drawn by the search for engineering talent Silicon Valley companies began their migration to Israel in the mid-1970s a movement that has continued to the point where today California R&D centers are pervasive” the report states. “Silicon Valley’s footprint can be seen most deeply in its concentrated investment in software and IT services.

More highlights of the report:

• From January 2003 to February 2021 California companies made 147 foreign direct investment projects in Israel. Software and IT services was the leading field followed by semiconductors financial services and communications.

• 103 California companies invested a total of $22.4 billion in Israeli companies between 2003 and 2021.

• California-based companies are responsible for 20 percent of all acquisitions of Israeli companies globally and for 42% of all acquisitions by US-based companies.

• Out of 402 multinational companies with an innovation presence in Israel 96 are California headquartered and 80 of those are from the Bay Area.

• California hosts 140 Israeli-owned firms that support 6248 jobs amounting to $615 million in wages.

• California is home to 22 Israeli-founded technology unicorns the most of any US state.

• Three of the five largest Israeli acquisitions in history and seven of the top 15 acquisitions were made by California companies including Mobileye and Moovit by Intel Mellanox by NVIDIA and Waze by Google.

Silicon Valley-headquartered firms such as Applied Materials KLA Corporation IBM Oracle Cisco Salesforce and Intel exemplify the role that Israel plays in the global R&D and business strategy of multinational companies.

“Intel with 14000 employees is both Israel’s largest technology company and its largest private employer” the report states.

Looking toward the future the report pinpoints promising fields for future cooperation as biotech data science and security particularly advanced cryptographic systems such as postquantum cryptography.

“Embedding intelligence at the edges of computing — through intelligent vehicles and highway systems for example — is creating new security vulnerabilities. With more intelligence in the grid there is a growing question of how to secure it and with the world at an inflection point between data-enabled connectivity and systemic vulnerability a rich opportunity exists for collaboration with Israel in fields such as AI and cybersecurity” the report predicts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC92dy1ncm91cC13b3JraW5nLW9uLXdpcmVsZXNzbHktY2hhcmdpbmcteW91ci1wb3JzY2hlLXRheWNhbi10by04MC1wZXJjZW50LWluLTEwLW1pbnV0ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VW Group Working On Wirelessly Charging Your Porsche Taycan To 80 Percent In 10 Minutes,"Early trials are promising and the system's power has been ramped up from 6.6 to 120 kW although the goal is to reach 300 kW

Volkswagen Group of America’s Innovation Hub Knoxville the company’s technology unit for applied materials science is expanding its research collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the University of Tennessee Knoxville to work on future technology.

Together the three partners aim to “explore how to integrate breakthroughs in material science and recycling concepts to support electric mobility and sustainable transportation.” Their first project will test a better way to recharge wirelessly.

The partners plan to work on ORNL’s high-power wireless EV charging concept with a Porsche Taycan. The goal is to make a breakthrough in wireless charging design that focuses on electromagnetic waves to eliminate interference.

Early trials are promising and a prototype system has already shown an efficiency of up to 98 percent. That means that almost all of the power leaving the charger makes it to the vehicle. By working with VW the team has been able to ramp up the power from 6.6 kW to 120 kW. The goal though is to ultimately reach a 300 kW power level which would allow the Taycan to charge to 80 percent in just 10 minutes.

“We are excited to work with Volkswagen to demonstrate ORNL’s high-powered ultra-efficient wireless charging technology” said Xin Sun Associate Laboratory Director for Energy Science and Technology at ORNL. “Our unique polyphase electromagnetic coil design and power electronics provide high power transfer levels in a compact system with the potential to alleviate electric vehicle range anxiety and speed the decarbonization of the U.S. transportation sector.”

The research will expand beyond that though into areas such as advanced functional materials. That includes composite car body parts plant-based materials for interior designs and new recycling concepts for materials that have historically been considered non-recyclable such as fiber-reinforced composites.

“The global Volkswagen Group aims to build a more sustainable vision of future mobility worldwide and we connect the best researchers in the world to make that a reality” said Nikolai Ardey Executive Director Group Research at Volkswagen Group. “Co-innovating with partners like Oakridge National Laboratory and University of Tennessee helps to multiply the power of Volkswagen’s international innovation team.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6b20uY29tL25ld3MuYXNweD9uZXdzSUQ9NTcxMjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Potential of Hybrid Organic–Inorganic Perovskites,"The huge family of composites based on perovskites has sparked a lot of attention as a result of recent developments in materials science research. Perovskite is a substance with the same crystalline structure as the first perovskite crystal found calcium titanium oxide. Perovskite has piqued the curiosity of material scientists because of its extensive availability in nature. Research in the journal by the American Institute of Physics (AIP) dives deep into the evolution of perovskite materials.

Due to their low production cost and higher efficiency perovskite-based photovoltaic cells with hybrid organic-inorganic metal halides as a light-collecting active material are regarded as prospective materials in the photovoltaic sector.

Power Generation Using Perovskites

Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are a new class of perovskite materials with a wide range of unique optoelectronic characteristics that might be used in power generation that are both sustainable and environmentally friendly.

These materials might also be used to fine-tune structural electrical and optical characteristics in response to external stimuli such as temperature pressure and electric fields which could be useful in types of energy materials.

Over the last decades solar cells from hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) have significantly developed power conversion efficiency surpassing 25.5 percent. HOIPs have been studied extensively in order to produce novel materials for photovoltaic modules natural light-emitting diodes and field-effect transistors.

The increased absorption coefficient fully variable bandgap and extended diffusion lengths of HOIPs distinguish them as exceptional photovoltaic cell materials for a variety of technological applications.

The material CaTiO 3 and any configuration with the same ABX 3 are referred to as perovskite.

The stability with those HOIP materials may be improved using various compositional technologies and systems such as tweaking their characteristics by changing the organic or inorganic cations. Despite the fact that the inorganic component of the electronic band structure is the most important the organic cation impacts the inorganic framework by reacting with the adjacent 12 halogens which changes the optical and electrical characteristics.

These HOIPs have become the most attractive material for solar cells due to improved photovoltaic characteristics while maintaining structural integrity.

Evolutions in HOIPs materials

Hydrostatic pressure has been successfully used as a sensitive technique to control hybrid perovskites' photovoltaic characteristics and morphological phases in new investigations. Many studies have shown that the condition of the A-site ion significantly impacts diffusing lengths or carriers' lifetimes compared to those of highly pure single-crystal semiconductors.

It has been demonstrated that the crystalline structure of HOIPs material expresses itself under pressure through numerous structural phases that are normally unavailable due to temperature variations.

Pressure-induced processes such as lattice strain phase transition Jahn–Teller phenomenon photochromism Rashba-splitting and others help to improve photovoltaic semiconductors. Extreme behavior in substances such as metallization increased or forced superconductivity and magnetic structuring can be improved by lattice compression.

HOIPs' electrical versatility has allowed them to be used in various applications including LEDs and white-light phosphors. Although two-dimensional hybrid perovskites are used as solar absorbers with improved electrical characteristics their three-dimensional counterparts have photovoltaic and optoelectronic uses.

The materials structures formed at these elevated pressures can be thought of as solids with expanded electronic bands that have enough orbital overlapping to allow charge carrier movement resulting in a less deformable phase.

The systematic study of metallization in HOIPs under pressure to achieve improved excitonic transport capabilities as well as superior electrical properties like superconductivity is an interesting subject. In order to expose the enhancement of material qualities with pressure a new subject called material pressure engineering may be researched which integrates both breakthroughs in materials science and engineering ways to incorporate pressure for optimal use.

There are various difficulties in the subject of pressure in HOIPs that can be studied in the coming years. The low pressure (or hydrostatic tensile pressure) in HOIPs a hot new tool for tuning functional and structural features at the nanoscale is among the main areas of interest.

The study of chaotic amorphous phase HOIPs at high pressure which has received less attention than the crystalline phase has also become a hot research area. As previously said changing the organic portion of HOIPs is critical for increased system stability. Therefore research into the structural transition of any organic material in HOIPs under high pressure is yet another intriguing area to pursue.

Another current difficulty in the area is designing and constructing HOIPs that exhibit desired changes at low pressure. That is because high-pressure analysis in HOIPs is another method of discovering novel materials; high-pressure application allows the material to be structurally transformed fully.

Having a crush on Zayn Malik is not hard. For starters he was A-L-W-A-Y-S the bad boy of One Direction he started an iconic collection of tattoos way before Harry Styles did he had THE BEST solos in the group (feel free to fight me on that) and most importantly he was often shrouded in a big fat cloud of mystery. Like…posting to Instagram only a handful of times per year? Mysterious as hell!

But you know what else is hella mysterious about Zayn? The fact that no one *truly* knows how he makes his money. Obvi the bulk of it comes from his 1D days and music releases but aside from that…we don’t know too much. And considering the fact that he’s about to become a father to Gigi Hadid’s baby girl it’s worth digging into!

Here’s a lil breakdown of Zayn’s $$$. Apologies in advance to your empty piggy bank.

Let’s Go Back Back to the Beginning

And no I’m not talking about to the day that Zayn was born. I’m talking about November 8 2011 aka the now-legendary day that One Direction released its debut album Up All Night.

The album OUTSOLD. Up All Night topped the charts in 16 countries sold 4.5 million copies worldwide by 2012 and grossed more than $5 million with the album’s corresponding tour. And that was just the start of Zayn’s career as a musician!

According to Celebrity Net Worth the rest of the 2010s were incredibly kind to One Direction (while they were still together 😭). The site reports that between June 2013 and June 2014 One Direction earned $75 million in revenue and in the subsequent year that figure grew to $130 million. Oh and that Where We Are Tour? Yep that made a whopping $282 million. So yeah Zayn was making bank.

We Can’t Forget His Solo Career Though

Zayn broke hearts everywhere when he decided to leave One Direction in 2015 but to his credit it was a massive power move. The following year Zayn released his first solo album Mind of Mine and it did stupidly well on the charts. Mind of Mine secured the number one spot on the United States’ Billboard 200 Chart sold 232000 copies in its first three weeks of release and topped daily iTunes charts in more 70 countries. And here’s a major flex: With Mind of Mine Zayn also became the first British male solo artist to get a number one album with a debut record since George freakin’ Michael.

Two years later Zayn released his sophomore effort Icarus Falls. In the United Kingdom the album moved only 1730 copies in the first week of release and it peaked at 61 on the Billboard 200 Chart. But! On September 10 2020 Icarus Falls was certified gold by the RIAA meaning that it sold more than 500000 copies. An impressive feat!

Later that month on September 25 2020 Zayn proved he's an artist who just never stops releasing ""Better"" the first single from this (then forthcoming) third studio album Nobody is Listening. The track was Zayn's first solo release in almost two years and on January 8 2021 he followed it up with ""Vibez"" which served as Nobody is Listening's second single. The full album dropped just over a week later on January 15 2021. The album was met with overall favorable reviews and performed pretty well commercially peaking at No. 44 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and No. 17 on the U.K. Albums Chart and racking up more than 300 million streams on Spotify. Not. Too. Shabby.

About His Home Purchases…

Zayn paid $3.1 million for a swanky single-story home in Bel Air back in 2015 and he remodeled it to include a weird space-themed galaxy room. In October 2018 Zayn listed the property for $3.5 million but ended up walking away with $2.94 million after the sale.

Believe it or not that wasn’t the only time Zayn took an L with one of his properties! In March 2018 Zayn purchased a Very Expensive™ penthouse in New York’s Soho neighborhood for (wait for it!) $10.69 million and listed it for sale in July 2019 for $10.8 million. Zayn’s property didn’t sell until January 2020 and he made $9.45 million from the sale. Ho hum.

Zayn is trying to be more low-key now—in May he purchased a farm in Pennsylvania next to Yolanda Hadid’s place where he and Gigi were reportedly isolating together.

His Creative Endeavors Would Like a Word

Did you know that Zayn is super into fashion?? Well if not now you do. In October 2016 Zayn was named the creative director of Versus Versace and released a collection titled Zayn x Versus the following May.

In January 2017 Zayn created a capsule collection with the Italian footwear gods at Giuseppe Zanotti. In September 2018 he also codesigned a line of backpacks (which he took some very hot pics with might I add) with The Kooples.

Reminder: Luxury designer goods don’t come cheap so Zayn likely made a pretty penny off of creating collections with these brands.

Sooo What the Heck Is His Net Worth?

Celebrity Net Worth claims that Zayn is currently clocking in at a cool $75 million meaning that yes…his and Gigi's daughter Khai will want for nothing.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Haïti - FLASH : Naufrage au large de Grosse pointe au moins 39 victimes





Dans la nuit du vendredi 29 au samedi 30 octobre 2021 un petit bateau surchargé assurant le transport Marigot/Anse-à-Pitres transportant du ciment des produits alimentaires du carburant et un grand nombre de passagers a fait naufrage au large de la localité de Grosse Pointe dans le département du Sud-Est.



Selon la Direction de la Protection Civile du Sud-Est le bilan provisoire serait de 20 survivants et au moins 19 morts. L'agent exécutif intérimaire de Marigot René Danneau nous informe que les recherches se poursuivent pour retrouver des survivants.



La pénurie d’essence dans le département a empêché les sauveteurs de Service Maritime et de Navigation d'Haïti (SEMANAH) de venir en aide aux victimes à temps et a également ralenti le processus de recherche par les autorités.



Réagissant à cette tragédie le Premier Ministre a.i. Ariel Henry à déclaré

« Nous avons appris dans la douleur et avec émoi la triste nouvelle du naufrage d'un bateau ce matin assurant le trajet Anse-à-Pitre/Marigot et qui a entraîné la mort de 19 de nos compatriotes. Nous présentons nos condoléances aux familles des victimes et au peuple haïtien. Face à ce nouveau drame survenu dans des conditions déplorables nous tenons à assurer les familles des victimes ainsi que les survivants du plein soutien du Gouvernement et des autorités locales. »

Les médias transalpins se souviendront de lui comme le créateur d'un des desserts les plus mythiques d'Italie. Le restaurateur Ado Campeol surnommé ""le père du tiramisu"" est décédé à l'âge de 93 ans.

Pourtant il n'est pas réellement le créateur du dessert composé de biscuits imbibés de café et de mascarpone. C'est son épouse accompagnée du chef Roberto Linguanotto qui en ont eu l'idée et l'ont mis au menu de leur restaurant de Trévise dans le nord de l'Italie en 1972.

Le tiramisu un accident?

Sur Twitter Luca Zaia gouverneur de la région de la Vénétie a rendu hommage à Ado Campeol en assurant que Trévise avait ""perdu une autre étoile dans son histoire gastronomique et viticole"".

Plusieurs légendes ont accompagné l'origine du tiramisu. Certains estiment qu'il aurait été servi comme aphrodisiaque dans une maison close de Trévise. Mais il est communément admis que c'est bien au sein du restaurant des Campeol que le dessert a été créé...accidentellement.

Là encore c'est une anecdote qui aide à créer le mythe du tiramisu: selon le co-inventeur du dessert le chef Roberto Linguanotto le plat est le résultat d'un accident lors de la fabrication de glace à la vanille. Il aurait laissé tomber du mascarpone dans un bol contenant des œufs et du sucre et après avoir remarqué le goût agréable du mélange il en aurait parlé à la femme d'Ado Campeol Alba.

Le duo aurait ensuite perfectionné le dessert en ajoutant des biscuits à la cuillère imbibés de café en les saupoudrant de cacao. Le célèbre ""tiramisu"" est né. Il est depuis devenu un incontournable de la cuisine italienne adapté par les chefs du monde entier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpldW5lYWZyaXF1ZS5jb20vMTI1ODk0OC9wb2xpdGlxdWUvbWFsaS1xdWktYXNzaW1pLWdvaXRhLWEtdC1pbC1kZXNpZ25lLXBvdXItb3JnYW5pc2VyLWxlcy1hc3Npc2VzLW5hdGlvbmFsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mali : qui Assimi Goïta a-t-il désigné pour organiser les Assises nationales ?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1258948/politique/mali-qui-assimi-goita-a-t-il-designe-pour-organiser-les-assises-nationales/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpldW5lYWZyaXF1ZS5jb20vMTI1ODk0OC9wb2xpdGlxdWUvbWFsaS1xdWktYXNzaW1pLWdvaXRhLWEtdC1pbC1kZXNpZ25lLXBvdXItb3JnYW5pc2VyLWxlcy1hc3Npc2VzLW5hdGlvbmFsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

“Thank you for your free speech. I’m so glad you have freedom” Matthews the evening’s host said from the stage in an awkward attempt to recognize the protester. “Well that was uncomfy for all of us but we have to fight for everyone’s rights. Thank you for my opener” he moved on back on his feet.

And so set the tone for the evening. Each year in a star-studded ceremony GLAAD gives awards to LGBTQ+ media and bestows two honors: one to a trailblazing LGBTQ+ personality and another to an allied media icon. This year’s recipients were Orville Peck and Jennifer Hudson respectively introduced by Jennifer Lawrence and Laverne Cox.

Popular on Variety

But the GLAAD Media Awards are populated by donors and celebrity advocates. During a charged moment of generational protest over war in the Middle East and the lead-up to an existential election most are too hamstrung by the companies or productions they represent to engage in the political matters which charge the moment. Money not words is how the room votes.

Matthews refreshingly honest summed up the dilemma to Variety before the ceremony began perhaps anticipating some disturbance to his monologue.

“I have to be careful and I’ll tell you honestly: I hate that I have to” he told Variety. “We’re so divided now that I feel like if you state an opinion you alienate half the country.” Matthews in addition to his tenured role as producer and judge on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” is also a newly minted producer and co-host on “The Drew Barrymore Show.”

“Lines have been drawn. Whatever you believe you have to show up” he said with a knowing wince at his generality. “Especially when you have a platform — myself included — you have to be careful and I hate that. But you have to find balance. There are some things I keep to myself and there are some things I can’t. GLAAD is one of them. In my monologue tonight you’ll hear some things I can’t not say.”

Matthews did get out a few jabs: “Since some members of the Supreme Court think it’s okay for them to tell women what to do with their bodies maybe we should tell them what they can do with theirs” he chided at the top of the award show. “Like maybe they can go fuck themselves?”

Lawrence there to introduce and honor her friend Peck also used her introductory speech to hurl a few rousing insults at prominent Republicans albeit ones who matter less these days.

“I love the gay community. In fact I was in love with a homosexual. I tried to convert him for years but now I know conversion therapy doesn’t work” she began. “Did you hear me Mike Pence? I said conversion therapy isn’t real even though I know you think it worked on you” she hurled to a giddy audience. “He’s in New York tonight. He’s receiving a Kid’s Choice Award for weirdest dick.”

Gay and transgender rights have a place in many of the political and social justice issues which confront voters this election cycle. Most guests on Saturday telegraphed what they hoped to say through pursed lips.

“I have to give you my ‘Miss America’ answer” said Sasha Velour a former “RuPaul’s Drag Race” winner and current co-host of HBO’s “We’re Here.” “LGBTQ+ activists have been at the forefront of all social justice movements” she told Variety. “Even now with students organizing to support Gaza it’s queer people who are organizing. We’re part of every community even if we aren’t welcomed.”

Jaida Essence Hall another “Drag Race” winner and “We’re Here” co-host grinned through her teeth: “Gay rights are human rights” she told Variety on the red carpet echoing the famous phrase. “Speaking up for social issues is like a buffet. There’s always room to go back for more. Everyone has a right to live where they are and be where they want to be. Wink wink.”

GLAAD of course is a political organization. While the glitz and glamor is fun — the award show also featured appearances by Uma Thurman Don Lemon and Loren Allred who sang “Never Enough” — the $350000 raised on Saturday evening will primarily support get-out-the-vote initiatives and ad-buying through the election season.

It’s no surprise then that no guest roused louder applause and a hastier standing ovation than New York Attorney General Letitia James who took the stage to introduce GLAAD’s president Sarah Kate Ellis. Clad in a warrior-like evening dress overlaid with chain mail-like accents James lit up the room. In her hands — still glossy with a $355 million bounty from Donald Trump — rested real change the crowd reasoned.

“I love you more” she shouted back at the star-struck audience with her strong New York brogue. “In New York we say gay. We say lesbian. We say bi. We say transgender and we say history” she rallied with a stab at Florida’s infamous “Don’t Say Gay” legislation. “In New York we don’t just say these words. We embody them each and every day and we celebrate the history of everyone.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXJ0LW9mLWFuaW1hdGlvbi1yZXNvcnQtd29ydGgtaXQtZm9yLWFkdWx0cy1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtMjAyNC010gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnQtb2YtYW5pbWF0aW9uLXJlc29ydC13b3J0aC1pdC1mb3ItYWR1bHRzLWRpc25leS13b3JsZC0yMDI0LTU_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Staying at Disney's Art of Animation as an adult worth it for $265,"My husband and I stayed at Disney's Art of Animation Resort for $265 a night.

Too often users fixate on a single issue or are not aware of what's even possible. Marc asserts that instead companies should be ready to ask why their customers use the software every day. Learn what they are trying to solve. For example merchant businesses need to know more about their customers and loan officers need to better assess risk. He adds that a business solution should be able to tell merchants which customer segments are more likely to return purchased items or to help identify loan risks upfront. Then envision how the design might unfold.

Similarly the technology can be utilized for product and packaging design optimization reducing material use and encouraging recyclable materials.

The versatility of the technology is already a talking point among retailers around the globe with 92% planning to ramp up their investments in Generative AI as per a GlobalNewswire release.

Immersive Reality will No Longer be a Novelty

Retailers bet big on experience as a major differentiator and try using technology to drive experience as a differentiator. The evolution of Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality has thrown open a new paradigm in experience that seamlessly marries the physical with the virtual. The ability to experience furniture fashion and more from the comfort of the drawing room is a relatively new experience one that customers are eagerly absorbing and consuming. According to a survey by PWC India China and Qatar are most keen on VR. The survey states that 32% of users buy products after checking them out on VR platforms. A similar report on AR from NielsenIQ highlights that 56% of customers feel more confident about the product using AR while 61% said they prefer to shop with retailers offering AR experiences.

AR/VR and MR empower retailers to:

Entertain – Walmart collaborated with DC Comics and Marvel to bring superhero-themed AR experiences to selected outlets

The evolving wave of spatial computing that utilizes a range of technologies including AI ML AR and IoT to establish an awareness of the three-dimensional (3D) environment surrounding an object enable it to interact seamlessly with its surroundings is a fast-developing technology poised to take the experience quotient to another level and promise an immersive engaging future for retail consumers and better returns for retailers. The growing influence of immersive technologies is charting the way for retailers into the evolutionary world of the Metaverse. Retail giants like Nike Gucci and Adidas among others have already made a foray into the virtual world by buying real estate building digital stores conducting fashion shows and hosting concerts. The future state of this space holds a lot of promise for retailers as it is expected to create a digital connection between the customer and the brand like never before. Retail brands are excited about the opportunity as it provides them with direct access to zero-party data of customers enabling retailers and service providers to establish a hyper-personalized connection with the customers. The customer is enthusiastic and buoyed by the surreal experience that is being rendered across these new digital platforms which promises to better all previous experiences from the past.

Expanding the Expanse with Omnichannel Integration

Powering the futuristic omnichannel retail ecosystem at the front end will be a headless commerce architecture that delivers a distinctive consistent customer experience across channels and supports all touchpoints with shared functionalities such as wish lists appointment booking and payments. This architecture is also expected to be more scalable and flexible than a traditional monolithic architecture as it is decoupled from the backend giving retailers the ability to drive changes faster. The world is steadfastly embracing IoT in the shape of wearables home automation and more. The headless architecture will help retailers deliver content across each device type without reinventing the wheel keeping the experience consistent. Talking of the backend the move towards a microservices-based architecture at the backend can also be a game changer for retailers. This decoupling of the monolithic architecture at the backend will help retailers to upgrade or revamp a specific function quickly for example integrating biometrics into the sign-in function or integrating gesture recognition for payment. These new-age capabilities can be separately developed and deployed in a modular fashion. This is unlike how it is done in the traditional monolithic architecture where the complete system would need a revamp for the addition of any functionality.

Blockchain Safeguarding Digital Assets Across the Virtual Terrain

Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that provides robust security and transparency for safeguarding digital assets in the retail sector across the digital landscape. Through its immutable and distributed nature blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and data reducing fraud and enhancing trust. For example in supply chain management blockchain can trace the origin and journey of products allowing customers to verify the authenticity and quality of goods. It also acts as a powerful tool for driving sustainability within the retail sector by providing retailers insight into their supply chains promoting responsible sourcing and reducing waste. By verifying product authenticity blockchain helps combat counterfeiting ensuring that consumers receive genuine quality products discouraging the production of environmentally damaging fakes.

In e-commerce blockchain-based payment systems like Bitcoin offer secure and borderless transactions eliminating the need for intermediaries. Blockchain can also be a game changer in driving loyalty programs enabling retailers to offer customers rewards securely while smart contracts an agreement based on blockchain technology that kicks in automatically once certain conditions are met can enforce credible transparent agreements on product authenticity warranties or refund policies ensuring a seamless and trust-driven retail experience. Blockchain holds significant value in a rapidly digitizing world that is embracing Non-Fungible Tokens or unique digital identifiers recorded on a blockchain ledger as an identification of ownership and authenticity for digital assets such as art music fashion or any other collectible owned by an entity. One of the main advantages of NFTs is that they allow people to own and intellectual property. NFT cannot be replicated a strong reason why fashion labels and multinational retail conglomerates are exploring the use of NFTs to secure ownership of digital assets and thwart counterfeiting.

Embracing the Future of Retail Technology Today

As inflation and fears of an economic slowdown weigh heavy on the minds of consumers curtailing their spending retailers will need to embrace the advances in technology to attract convince and drive sales to build an all-encompassing retail ecosystem. Retailers will need to deploy new-age strategies powered by contemporary technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain augmented and virtual reality and more to get up close and personal with their customers building long-lasting trust and value. Retailers will have to look at technology not just for delivering convenience and experience but also as a medium to drive sustainability and security. The time is ripe for retailers to embrace the future of technology to catapult from digital transformation to digital ascendance.

‘Make a Mark’ is a three-year collaboration platform created to accelerate creative and technological innovation in wine and spirits packaging and provide brand owners with a preview of the future packaging design trends. The goal is to stimulate designers’ creativity with a special focus on luxury and sustainability.

Without cost and technological constraints eighteen of the best packaging design agencies on a global level have been challenged to push their creativity further and break new ground in packaging innovation.

The brief was to satisfy the brands’ double need to make the difference on the shelf by catching the consumer’s eye while respecting the environment.

The resulting trailblazing design projects have then been developed by leaders in the luxury packaging supply chain like Estal for the glass bottles Avery Dennison for the labeling materials Kurz for the embellishments plus many other key players in the industry like label printers capsule and closure manufacturers.

“Make a Mark is not a design contest and the Make a Mark book is not a catalog featuring the current packaging design trends. It showcases the prototypes created by the industry pioneers leading the way towards a new era of wine and spirits packaging design. Make a Mark is an ambitious project which has engaged more than forty partners for many months in order to first create and then develop such futuristic packaging projects” said Vladimir Tyulpin Avery Dennison’s market segment leader – Wine & Spirits.

Stéphane Royère director of the packaging and print business area at Leonhard Kurz had the honor of presenting the Make a Mark Design Gallery to H.S.H. Prince Albert II who visited the booth. “His Highness greatly appreciated our project but the next edition of Make a Mark will be even more ambitious. We have already been working on the 2022 edition to develop some new ideas that will increase the interest of those brands that wish to invest into their product packaging to make a difference on the shelf while decreasing the packaging impact on the environment.”

Make a Mark — Brands need creativity

The constant acceleration of business in the time of globalization leaves no room for promises. Brands want concrete proposals. The primary need of brands is to create packaging that is attractive but at the same time sustainable. “This is why we Make a Mark Design Gallery at the recent Luxe Pack aroused great interest from the most important brands in the wine & spirits segment and in cosmetics. Make a Mark has freed the creativity of some of the most awarded packaging design studios in the world “pushing” us players in the packaging supply chain to rapidly develop new technologies and new materials that are truly at the forefront in terms of sustainability.

Enticed by the prospects of AI and machine learning to predict problems before they occur—and the possibilities for optimizing production sourcing staffing and safety—oil and gas companies around the world have made large internal investments and launched trials and pilots to leverage this technology.

Many of these attempts have yet to impact a company’s bottom line. Why? Because they’ve been unable to collect all the data in one place; adapt culturally from manual decision-making to machine learning-assisted processes; secure the right talent; or achieve scale. Success in bypassing these roadblocks requires collaboration.

Petronas Malaysia’s integrated oil and gas company recently announced an extensive expansion of digital programs to better tackle AI at scale.



“Petronas addresses the energy demands of today by leveraging the power of digital as an accelerator technology as a differentiator and data as an asset”

– says Petronas Project Delivery and Technology Senior Vice President Samsudin Miskon.



“Petronas is committed to accelerated digital transformation that delivers productivity efficiency visibility safety and performance. The predictive intelligence of AI is critical to meeting these needs and this is only possible with AI that drives outcomes at pace and scale.”

How the DIY energy AI approach has evolved

Petronas is not alone in initiating significant programs before partnering with proven platform providers to launch a scaled AI approach. As companies seek to capitalize on technology breakthroughs to deliver oil and gas more efficiently safely and sustainably energy behemoths from West to East are now taking a more partnered approach to their digital transformation programs. Companies such as Chevron and BP have made announcements around AI programs to extract data from drilling reports and to reduce emissions.

Saudi Arabia similarly has prioritized IR 4.0 (the Fourth Industrial Revolution) in its In-Kingdom Total Value Add (IKTVA) program which aims to increase localization of oil and gas suppliers. Saudi Aramco’s 4IR Center is dedicated to developing cutting-edge technology and AI solutions are now being deployed at sites including Uthmaniyah one of the world’s largest gas plants.

The progress in AI adoption is notable but the issue of scaling domain-specific solutions remains. Many of these initial projects take place as trials or pilots at particular plants or fields. The test comes when businesses are tasked with scaling initial pilots across operations enterprise-wide.



“How many companies have actually gone past the pilot stage and implemented enterprise AI solutions at scale?”

– asks Ed Abbo President and Chief Technology Officer at C3 AI.



It’s relatively easy to create a one-off AI model but very difficult to train deploy and operate millions of models that continuously aggregate and analyze data from numerous disparate data sources and sensor networks across hundreds of thousands of assets and systems. Industry failure rates for enterprise AI applications highlight the fact that it’s nearly impossible to implement these predictive applications and achieve scale without a combination of the right AI application platform to simplify technology and oil and gas domain expertise.

Why an AI-enabled oil company boosts efficiency and automation

This is where BakerHughesC3.ai (BHC3) combining Baker Hughes’s energy technology and deep domain expertise and C3 AI’s software suite comes in. A DIY approach to developing AI applications can take 18 or more times longer than using a proven pre-integrated platform like that offered by BHC3 an independent study commissioned by C3 AI showed. Building applications using this platform accelerated development by a factor of 30 (three days

compared to 90 days) and required drastically less development code (14 lines of code compared to more than 3000) “while reducing delivery risk” compared to alternate approaches the report concluded.[1]

The advantage of a partner goes beyond domain expertise and technology. Petronas was looking to improve the reliability of more than a dozen energy assets in critical operations—by improving maintenance programs for gas turbines and by improving the reliability of control valves with early detection of anomalous conditions preventing downtime. The company announced partners with energy technology data science and AI experts at Baker Hughes and C3 AI to collaborate on projects focused on improving reliability of energy assets in critical

operations.



“So the traditional approach has been to say ‘OK we want to digitally transform our organization let’s build a big digital function we’re going to hire a bunch of data scientists and we’re going to build this thing ourselves”

– says Abbo.



“That talent is really hard to come by because there are a lot of companies vying for those same qualified software engineers and data scientists. But the build-it-yourself approach also significantly underestimates the level of investment and expertise required to successfully build a common AI design and operating platform to scale and maintain it in production enterprise AI applications.”

How petro manufacturing AI improves performance and reduces downtime

Global manufacturers are facing unprecedented challenges from supply chain disruptions significant demand fluctuations reliability issues and heightened customer expectations. In addition to dealing with pressures on profitability and growth they are also battling new classes of nimble digital-native competitors. AI presents an opportunity to bring together data — from demand forecasts customer orders production costs and parts inventory — and improve production schedules to better match forecasted demand.

Koch Industries the second-largest private company in the United States holding a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries including energy companies that specialize in refining manufacturing distribution and chemicals has made progress developing AI programs. Acceleration and growth at the scale required to meet business needs meant taking a new approach. In 2020 the company announced standardization of AI programs on the C3 AI Suite giving access to Koch Industries companies including Georgia-Pacific Flint Hills Resources and Molex.

“We recognize the need to leverage AI in our ongoing transformations and while we’ve made progress by taking the do-it-yourself approach we also realized we needed to go faster and scale across our diverse enterprise” said Jim Hannan EVP and CEO of Enterprise for Koch Industries in a June 2020 press release. ""The C3 AI Suite allows us to take advantage of our existing investments while accelerating our AI transformation so Koch companies can better serve their customers.”

Fueling transformation — and transition

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has stated that efficiency will be key in meeting the world’s decarbonization goals representing 37% of total emission reductions needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Utilization of data to drive these results is no longer a choice but a matter of survival.

“The energy industry is at a unique inflection point” says Abbo. “Leading operators are fundamentally changing their business models to take advantage of new opportunities from the energy transition. To survive companies will need to activate massive amounts of data to inform near real-time decisions that’s where AI comes in.”

Helping to keep a lid on prices were concerns over rising U.S. supply and the possibility of fresh supply from Iran in the future. Underpinning prices were expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Russia and their allies known as OPEC+ would maintain production cuts.

On Friday December WTI crude oil futures settled at $83.22 up $0.41 or +0.50% and January Brent crude oil finished at $83.72 up $0.06 or +0.07%.

Potentially Bearish Factors Cap Gains

Crude oil gains were capped last week by a report from the government that showed U.S. crude stocks rose by 4.3 million barrels during the week-ending October 22.

Additionally Iran said talks on reviving the international deal on its nuclear program will restart by the end of November bringing it a set closer to boosting oil exports.

Limited Output Expectations from OPEC+ Supportive

An OPEC+ committee largely stuck to forecasts of a strong demand rebound this year and next ahead of a meeting next week at which the group is expected to rubber stamp a planned output increase of 400000 barrels per day (bpd) in December according to Reuters.

The Joint Technical Committee (JTC) which met on Thursday now expects oil demand to grow by 5.7 million bpd in 2021 120000 bpd below OPEC’s forecast in its latest monthly report two OPEC+ sources said.

The JTC left its demand forecast for next year steady at 4.2 million bpd one of the sources said.

OPEC+ forecasts are still higher than those of the International Energy Agency (IEA) which expects oil demand to grow by 5.5 million bpd in 2021 and 3.3 million bpd in 2022.

Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Russia and their allies – collectively known as OPEC+ – meet on November 4 to decide policy.

US Drillers Add Oil and Gas Rigs for 15th month in a Row – Baker Hughes

U.S. energy firms added oil and natural gas rigs for a 15th month in a row in October as oil prices soared to fresh seven-year highs prompting some drillers to return to the wellpad.

For the week the oil and gas rig count an early indicator of future output rose two to 544 in the week to October 29 its highest since April 2020 energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report Friday.

That was the seventh time the rig count increased in the past eight weeks. The total rig count was still up 248 or 84% over this time last year.

U.S. oil rigs rose one to 444 this week while gas rigs also gained one to 100 their highest since mid-September.

For the month the number of active oil rigs rose by 23 putting the total count up for a 14th month in a row for the first time since July 2017.

As the industry develops new clean sources of energy oil majors have committed to scale up massive renewable energy systems using solar and wind power while leveraging core domain strengths to deliver hydrogen biofuel geothermal and carbon capture and storage technologies. Parallel to this effort the world is demanding more energy and hydrocarbons will continue to play a significant role in the energy mix for years to come.

In the midst of a rapidly changing energy landscape efficiency is critical. Called “the first fuel of a sustainable global energy system”1 by the International Energy Agency (IEA) doing more with the same resources offers huge potential to significantly reduce greenhouse emissions energy costs and energy market volatility risks. Indeed the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario the blueprint for achieving international climate and energy goals forecasts that energy efficiency will be responsible for delivering more than 40% of the reduction in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions over the next 20 years.2

“At Baker Hughes we talk about three undeniable truths when it comes to the energy transition” says Uwem Ukpong Executive Vice President Regions Alliances & Enterprise Sales at Baker Hughes the global energy technology company. “First to meet net zero targets we must move faster. The urgency around the energy transition that has come forward over the past year highlights this need for accelerated action. Next if we want to fuel world economies with the energy they need while accelerating our move to net zero efficiency of energy operations is critical. Lastly meeting decarbonization and emissions reduction targets—including efficiency—is not an individual effort. Delivering technology for change requires collective global action.”

To reach new levels of efficiency that will reduce emissions today artificial intelligence (AI) paired with deep domain expertise is a potential game changer. AI is key to creating energy-efficiency solutions that are proactive rather than reactive. For instance a chemical processing plant using a steam-powered production system can apply AI to relevant sensor data steam availability data and related planning information to optimize steam flows generate the right amount of energy and reach optimal steam balance; in the process the plant reduces energy use and achieves efficiency and emission reduction targets. In the oil and gas industry data is often siloed in multiple disparate systems so it must be unified and analyzed in a logical efficient domain-relevant way to support enterprise-scale AI solutions.

The impact of these kinds of collective efficiencies could be significant for existing energy operations. Use of AI for environmental applications could reduce carbon intensity by up to 8% by 2030 according to a report by PwC3 and Microsoft.4

“Prior to this most recent downturn most efficiencies—by changing processes altering the supply chain improving the way we engineer and design equipment—had been achieved. Now we as an industry have to examine where we can further improve” says Ukpong. “It is clear that AI is at the core of this next productivity and efficiency step-change. AI is required to process the vast amount of historical and real-time energy data analyze that data to generate predictive insights and drive proactive actions that improve efficiencies. It all boils down to a domain-specific approach to predictive analytics that changes industrial oil and gas operations.”

Shell.ai’s global effort

Shell started developing and deploying AI in 2013 and started scaling enterprise AI in 2018 when it deployed C3 AI’s platform globally. By rapidly scaling and replicating focused AI and machine learning (ML) applications across its upstream integrated gas and downstream manufacturing businesses—for various purposes like flagging equipment likely to malfunction (predictive maintenance/reliability)—Shell is realizing emission reductions while also producing substantial economic value through lower costs reduced downtime and the improved safety of its operations. In June this year Shell and BHC3 announced that the flagship partnership has been renewed for another five years.

At Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands AI-enabled early detection saved an estimated $2 million in maintenance costs and downtime in just a single instance. Another example is that Shell achieved 25% time savings in certain work processes by integrating a range of their proprietary AI technologies that improve understanding of the subsurface to maximize recovery from new and existing oil and gas fields. Shell now regularly sees similar examples of optimization through AI across its businesses worldwide.

The efficiencies that come with this type of digital transformation and AI also directly translate into emission reductions. For example deploying a single AI solution to decrease boil-off gas and associated flaring has enabled Shell to reduce the process emissions of one LNG asset by 130 kilotons a year—the U.S. equivalent of taking 28000 vehicles off the road.

Shell is also using digitalization and AI to reduce the footprint of its operations. For example it uses AI to improve inventory demand planning reduce wastage of products and raw materials and decrease idle time of heavy machinery and uses AR robotics and digital twin technologies to reduce the need for travel. AI is also helping Shell offer low-carbon energy solutions to its customers from AI solutions that reduce the fuel consumption of ships; to smart charging of electric vehicles that optimizes renewable energy use on the grid; to virtual power plants that connect decentralized energy units from solar to bio-energy to hydropower.

“AI is a huge opportunity for us. We’re going through a digital transformation firstly to make ourselves more effective and efficient and secondly to make sure we thrive through the energy transition” says Daniel Jeavons Vice President Computational Science and Digital Innovation at Shell. “There’s huge disruption in the energy market and as we go through this and move toward cleaner energy solutions Shell wants to lead the way and AI plays a huge role in that.”

Shell selected the BHC3 AI Suite for the maturity‚ domain relevance scalability and extensibility of the platform and its unique model-driven AI architecture. The platform enables Shell’s developers and data scientists to integrate and process diverse energy data sets into a “unified data image”—a comprehensive view of important industrial aspects of a business. The real-time insights gained from this integrated data—from sources such as sensor networks and maintenance logs—help Shell rapidly develop‚ deploy and operate advanced AI and Internet of Things (IoT) applications across millions of the company’s assets such as refinery control valves‚ and individual oil and gas replacement parts in the supply chain and global markets.

“We chose BHC3 because we wanted a platform for our enterprise applications. We want to leverage the platform already created and bring our IP on top of that” says Jeavons. “What BHC3 offered as one of its core differentiators was a way to manage the tens of thousands of energy-focused machine learning models we run—the automation aspect both in terms of model management and model training.”

Open AI Energy Initiative

Earlier this year BHC3 Shell and Microsoft launched the Open AI Energy Initiative (OAI) a first-of-its-kind open ecosystem of AI-based solutions for the energy and associated process industries. The OAI provides a framework for energy operators service providers and equipment providers to offer interoperable solutions including AI- and physics-based models and monitoring diagnostics prescriptive actions and services for energy use cases.

The OAI augments BHC3 applications with partner-led domain-specific solutions that accelerate deployment of AI-based reliability solutions to make energy production cleaner safer and more efficient. It includes some of the solutions that Shell has proven at scale in its own operations.

This kind of collaboration is new for an industry that has traditionally taken a closed do-it-yourself approach to software.

“We believe you must know energy and software to change energy and this collaboration delivers on that premise” says Ukpong. “We simply will not move at speed or reach results at scale with AI if we do not leverage ecosystems like the OAI to deliver new domain-specific solutions.”

“At Shell we know we don’t have all the answers but we also recognize that the rich data assets that operators have built up over many years are critical to solving some of the toughest digital problems” says Jeavons. “We are committed to working as part of an ecosystem—bringing multiple players together to move forward in the AI space because no one company can solve the world’s AI problems. Also speed is paramount; the energy transition is forcing us to change more quickly. Alliances are critical to accelerating our progress and enabling AI deployment at scale.”

BHC3 and KBC: Collaboration around technology

The work that BHC3 is doing with KBC which provides domain-focused process simulation software to the energy industry is an example of how technology collaboration can deliver a significant improvement in efficiency at a time when productivity has reached a plateau. BHC3’s industrial-focused enterprise AI-enabled platform is being used to enhance Petro-SIM KBC’s process simulation software that helps operators from Brazil to India meet production goals and maximize profitability yielding what KBC estimates will be more than $0.65 per barrel in economic value for customers.

As energy demand picks up post-pandemic greater efficiency can also help meet that demand in a way that does not further increase emissions.

“If we look downstream there’s a lot of value leakage that can be reduced in the refining industry value chain with its heavy reliance on models pressure on people and multiple time horizons” says Mike Aylott Chief Technology Officer at KBC. “Digital technology allows us to transform the cycle enabling refiners to respond to the factors driving our industry; it could be supply push to demand pull deeper decarbonization building in operational agility or automating work processes.”

KBC adopted the BHC3 AI Suite because of its ability to scale up domain-specific AI across an enterprise a challenge that all manufacturing companies face as they expand their use of automated systems. Models change over time and can be out of date in six months resulting in several thousand models that then need to be updated. The BHC3 platform helps overcome what Aylott calls a “sustainability nightmare.”

Like Baker Hughes and C3 AI KBC and its parent company Yokogawa are focused on helping companies reach their sustainability goals. Enterprise AI applied to industrial oil and gas data is a key tool in the decarbonization challenge—making things happen that are repeatable over and over again says Aylott—and will help the industry move quickly to respond to societal and market pressures driving the energy transition.

Players of the Pennsylvania lottery may notice changes as soon as next year as the lottery has struck a new deal with vendors ahead of its anticipated 50th anniversary celebration on March 7 2022.

The majority of the modernization will be to the lottery's software and systems. There are other changes players will notice that include new vending equipment and in-store digital signage. The plan also includes an update to the Pennsylvania Lottery app. When the lottery marks its anniversary next year lottery officials promise 'exciting new things' for players but have not officially announced what those plans contain at this time.

The two vendors selected supply the lottery with its instant tickets otherwise known as scratch-offs. Pollard Banknote Limited was picked as a secondary supplier. Scientific Games Corporation was selected as the primary as well as the vendor selected to provide lottery gaming system services. On October 27th Scientific Games Corporation announced it had entered an agreement to sell its lottery business to Brookfield Business Partners L.P.

""Our partnership gives the Lottery access to our exclusive portfolio of unique and innovative products that can be leveraged to infuse further excitement and broaden the appeal of scratch-off games for new and existing players alike. We are confident that this will result in continued success by driving sales and maximizing profits that ultimately provide support to a very worthy beneficiary"" said Doug Pollard co-chief executive officer of Pollard Banknote.

Ewa Swope a spokesperson for the PA Lottery told FOX43 sales have stayed steady as the majority of PA Lottery retailers include essential businesses which stayed open throughout the pandemic.

""As the Pennsylvania Lottery approaches its 50th anniversary we couldn't be more excited to start working with these business partners to reinvent the Lottery and position it for future growth"" said PA Lottery Executive Director Drew Svitko.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbGVkb2JsYWRlLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvMTAvMzAvZmluZGxheS1vbmUtZW5lcmd5LXdpbmQtdHVyYmluZXMvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxMTAyMzAwMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Findlay-based One Energy makes foray into niche Wind for Industry market,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9kZWJhdGUvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDE0ODYyNS9QRVRFUi1ISVRDSEVOUy1LcmVtbGluLWNvbnNjaWVuY2UtV2VsYnktaHlwb2NyaXRlLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZGViYXRlL2FydGljbGUtMTAxNDg2MjUvYW1wL1BFVEVSLUhJVENIRU5TLUtyZW1saW4tY29uc2NpZW5jZS1XZWxieS1oeXBvY3JpdGUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PETER HITCHENS: Even the Kremlin had more of a conscience than Welby the hypocrite,"Even the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union eventually admitted that it had wrongly smeared and ruined those it had once accused of terrible crimes.

The victims of screaming one-sided show trials later murdered or starved to death and in one terrible case hanged cremated and their ashes used to grit the freezing roads all of them were in the end exonerated.

So why does Justin Welby Archbishop of Canterbury struggle so to admit he made a terrible mistake about the late Bishop George Bell of Chichester one of the greatest Englishmen of the 20th Century? He did not as many do mix him up with his near-namesake the revolting molester Peter Ball. Nor should you (I have had some very rude letters accusing me of defending Ball. I would not dream of doing any such thing).

But to put it at its mildest Mr Welby was involved in what has since been shown to be a shocking kangaroo trial in which the long-dead Bell a courageous opponent of the Nazis and ally of the German resistance to Hitler was presumed guilty of a terrible charge of child abuse.

PETER HITCHENS: Why does Justin Welby Archbishop of Canterbury struggle so to admit he made a terrible mistake about the late Bishop George Bell of Chichester one of the greatest Englishmen of the 20th Century?

My own view has long been that the complainant was abused but by somebody else. Her evidence against Bell when it was finally made public did not stand up to serious examination by a leading QC Lord Carlile.

But would Mr Welby back down? Not a bit of it.

First he took seriously a collection of new allegations against George Bell so ludicrous and feeble that even Dame Cressida Dick and her Olympically gullible Met Police Celebrity Squad would not have believed them. And when these duly collapsed he continued to insist that a 'significant cloud' hung over the reputation of George Bell. Apparently in his world if you are accused of a crime you will always remain suspect.

But Mr Welby so censorious about others now has troubles of his own. When he was a senior church official in Liverpool he banned a worshipper from the Cathedral there for being 'abusive and threatening'.

PETER HITCHENS: Mr Welby was involved in what has since been shown to be a shocking kangaroo trial in which the long-dead Bell a courageous opponent of the Nazis and ally of the German resistance to Hitler was presumed guilty of a terrible charge of child abuse

But the worshipper had his reasons. He was rightly trying to get Mr Welby to act against a priest who he said had abused him. In this case (unlike George Bell's) there was good reason to take the claim seriously.

The priest involved John Roberts already had a criminal conviction for indecent assault. Later Roberts was jailed for offences against three people – one of them the man Mr Welby had sternly banned from the Cathedral. This fascinating story about England's premier clergyman has received amazingly little media coverage outside our sister paper the Daily Mail.

Actually I can see Mr Welby's problem here. He made a bad judgment as many have done in such cases. But lawyers for the victims of Roberts point out that Mr Welby's failure to act could have delayed police action for many years. So he really is not in a position to set himself up as the Righteous Judge of George Bell.

That is why I wrote to the Church of England and asked if under the circumstances Mr Welby would withdraw the words 'significant cloud' and act to rehabilitate George Bell.

For Bishop Bell's name like that of a Soviet show-trial victim has been stripped from a building named after him from a school named after him and from a house in another school which was also named after him. A planned statue of him which should long ago have been completed and unveiled on the front of Canterbury Cathedral is in some sort of limbo.

I got nothing back except flannel. So here we are. As long as he will not withdraw the claim that there is a 'significant cloud' over George Bell then I say that Justin Welby is a hypocrite and a significant cloud hangs over him. Even the Kremlin had more of a conscience.

Little Amal masks a big problem

Last week I finally saw the peculiar giant puppet Little Amal which has been paraded across Europe supposedly to draw attention to the plight of refugees from Syria. The glowering thing came to Oxford my home town where it was paired with a rather po-faced mega-doll of Alice in Wonderland our local heroine.

Alice had an eye for human folly and spent a lot of time being the wrong size. But what she would have made of this political carnival I do not know. It is very odd. It strikes me that most Syrian refugees are not little girls but strapping young men. I wonder how a huge puppet of such a person would be greeted.

PETER HITCHENS: Last week I finally saw the peculiar giant puppet Little Amal which has been paraded across Europe supposedly to draw attention to the plight of refugees from Syria

It strikes me also that Little Amal actually 11ft 5in does not look at all like a small girl but like a rather snappish and cross Left-wing TV presenter perhaps on BBC's Newsnight. And finally it strikes me that if Left-wing persons in this country had not been so keen to stoke up a civil war in Syria and to intervene in Libya too there might not be so many refugees whether they were little girls or grown men.

How many who turn out to show obeisance to the Little Amal puppet even know of the vast billion-dollar CIA programme called Timber Sycamore by which the nice West fanned the flames of war in Syria and in some cases even ended up helping groups linked to Al Qaeda? What good did this do? The Syrian regime was and is terrible but do you make that better by turning people into corpses and refugees and by backing fanatics?

I have nothing but praise for those who personally welcome such refugees into their own homes. But I am less keen on those who think other people should shoulder the burden. If Little Amal was a real little girl she might wonder if she was being used.

I love a war with the French as much as any red-blooded Englishman but I am worried that the Foreign Secretary amazingly a former (?) anti-monarchist and Lib Dem called Liz Truss might be too keen on this fishy confrontation.

I will not be surprised if her official photographer snaps her on the bridge of a Royal Navy gunboat twirling a Nelsonian telescope while attired in a striking new nautical-style outfit from her remarkable wardrobe. Nothing it seems can stop her.

Sainsbury's falls to the zealots

The infiltration of every part of the country by zealots and activists is now nearing completion. You may have been worried about the takeover of the BBC the universities or your child's nursery by various sorts of fanatics. And rightly so. Banks bus companies and stately homes also ceaselessly emit the PC message.

The latest great institutions to fall are the supermarkets. They have begun to lecture us to eat more beans and lentils and less meat so as to save the planet. And last week I walked into a Sainsbury's under a display of little flags that proclaimed that the shop was 'Celebrating Black History Month'.

I seldom drive but modern petrol pumps seem to me to be getting quite bossy and I wonder how long it will be before they start lecturing customers about their carbon footprints and Black Lives Matter.

It's always one opinion. It's always expressed in such a way as to let you know that if you disagree the tiniest bit you'd better be quiet about it.

And while it's funny in a way in another way it is not funny at all.",,,,,,

The increasing focus on environmental social and governance (“ESG”) considerations at public companies including this year’s highly publicized proxy contest at Exxon Mobil Corporation (“Exxon”) has demonstrated the growing importance of understanding ESG and the implications it can have for investors and companies. Among the many ESG developments bubbling to the forefront of the markets in recent years is the desire of investors to see companies address social justice concerns. In particular shareholders have begun to request that companies conduct racial equity audits (“Racial Equity Audits”) which generally seek an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. We anticipate greater interest in Racial Equity Audits and similar initiatives in the upcoming proxy season and accordingly believe companies will be pushed to critically and objectively examine their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion to identify areas in need of improvement.

A. Overview of the ESG Landscape Today

ESG considerations can be broken down into three categories. First—environmental criteria which considers a company’s actions as a steward of the environment such as what steps a company is taking to address the depletion of the planet’s resources pollution and greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of climate change. Second—social criteria which considers how a company engages with all of its stakeholders (including employees customers and suppliers) rather than just shareholders including the treatment and diversity of its employees on the frontline management and boardroom levels the effects of a company on the surrounding community and whether a company is working with suppliers who share similar socially desirable values. Third—corporate governance which considers how a company governs itself and holds itself accountable taking into account the structure and diversity of a company’s board of directors the separation between management and the board of directors executive compensation equal and fair pay amongst employees and the extent to which a company or its management or board of directors are undertaking lobbying efforts making political and charitable donations or engaging in corruption or bribery.

With the increasing prominence of ESG awareness the market has also seen the rise of ESG-specific funds as a new form of investment vehicle. These funds have explicit mandates to make ESG-focused investments from mutual funds whose portfolio companies must score a high grade on ESG metrics to investment firms dedicated to ESG impact investing. In the U.S. market there are now over 600 ESG funds and exchange-traded funds for investors to choose from with approximately $161 billion in assets under management (“AUM”) which is more than double the AUM of ESG funds in 2010. According to research from Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) “ESG Funds were among the largest winners in 2020 taking in a record $60 billion in net flows nearly triple their 2019 total.”

In the meantime on November 9 2020 the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced the issuance of new final rules that expanded human capital management disclosure requirements applicable to SEC reporting companies. Since then SEC leadership has signaled that more comprehensive ESG-related disclosure could be mandated in the near future with SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee issuing statements earlier this year “directing the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings” and inviting input from “investors registrants and other market participants on climate change disclosure.” Former Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance John Coates also stated earlier in the year that the “SEC should help lead the creation of an effective ESG disclosure system so companies can provide investors with information they need in a cost-effective manner.” Based on these statements we believe there is a strong likelihood that the current SEC-mandated human capital management disclosures will soon be expanded to require additional disclosures covering environmental and other social initiatives and metrics further supporting a view that ESG awareness stewardship and reporting at public companies are here to stay.

As the ESG movement gains momentum and as the new wave of investors who factor ESG concerns into their investment decisions gain a larger share of the market companies are being advised to revisit their current policies and practices under the ESG lens. Companies that dismiss these concerns or lag behind their peers in addressing ESG matters may find themselves in the crosshairs of investors and proxy advisory firms or even state legislatures and federal agencies. On the other hand it has been found that companies that affirmatively adopt meaningful approaches to these issues may not only help progress environmental and societal goals but may also potentially see improved financial performance.

B. How ESG Ties Into Shareholder Activism

ESG considerations are becoming increasingly relevant to shareholder activists. This is because issues relating to climate change and the environment racial justice and diversity human capital and governance may influence companies at large and shareholder investment flows. Governance has long been a key focus of shareholder activists as corporate governance best practices including accountability of a company’s board of directors to its shareholders robust disclosure on executive compensation and independence of a board of directors from management have been found to have a readily apparent correlation with increased returns to shareholders. Recently however activists have begun to realize that social and environmental issues can also impact their investments in both negative and positive ways.

ISS and others have published a number of reports that have found that addressing social and environmental concerns correlates with companies either currently experiencing or having the potential to experience increased growth and profitability. As discussed in more detail below a company’s performance on ESG factors such as investment into renewable energy promotion of employee health and safety and contributions to the local community are pressing issues that can either benefit or adversely affect a company’s perception in the public eye operational execution and bottom line. Enhanced performance in these areas can lead to less scrutiny from environmental regulators increased customer loyalty more productive employees reduced employee turnover more lucrative business partnerships and increased profitability.

Improved ESG criteria is not a new area for activist investors. Shareholder activists have advocated for increased diversity in corporate boardrooms for a number of years. Concurrently with shareholder activists nominating an increasing number of diverse director candidates the voting policies of many institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc. (“BlackRock”) have been updated to reflect a desire to enhance boardroom diversity as have the voting guidelines of many prominent proxy advisory firms such as ISS. State governments have also codified ESG initiatives into law—California leading the charge with the passage of Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 which require a certain percentage of directors on the boards of public companies headquartered in the state be composed of females and individuals from underrepresented communities. Most shareholder activists are cognizant of the stance of institutional investors and proxy advisory firms on ESG issues and have increasingly incorporated ESG factors into their proxy campaigns.

C. Recent Push for Racial Equity Audits

Amongst the various ESG developments gaining traction in the markets is the recent push by shareholders for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits which generally consist of an objective investigation into a company’s practices policies and histories to determine such company’s impact on social issues and areas for improvement. In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020 and the subsequent civil rights movement and unrest many companies announced a number of initiatives and measures to address social justice issues including committing financial resources and reviewing their own policies and practices. However many advocates believe that without objective means to identify areas of improvement and monitor companies’ progress these commitments may be illusory and confirmation that these companies have in fact met their commitments could be difficult. Accordingly the 2021 proxy season saw an influx of shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (“Rule 14a-8”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits.

Just like its environmental and corporate governance counterparts addressing social concerns can be equally important to companies and investors alike as this can translate into among other things value additive results. For example following a racially-tinged incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks in 2018 where two African-American men who were waiting for a business meeting to begin were arrested the company performed a Racial Equity Audit which found that among other things racial sensitivity and the elimination of implicit biases are correlated to Starbuck’s core business plan of “creating an inclusive and equitable working environment as well as a welcoming ‘third place’ between home and work for customers.” In addition the W.K. Kellogg Foundation has found that “[b]y 2050 our country stands to realize an $8 trillion gain in GDP by closing the U.S. racial equity gap.”

II: Background and Overview

A. What Are Racial Equity Audits?

A Racial Equity Audit is at its core an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. Not only are Racial Equity Audits designed to help inform investors about their current and future investments from a social and financial perspective but are also intended to help companies craft their policies and practices to achieve their social justice goals.

According to certain proponents the point of a Racial Equity Audit is not necessarily to critique a company’s current platforms and efforts. Rather as argued by Trillium Asset Management (“Trillium”) a strong proponent of such audits the point of an audit is to embrace the notion that “if management is truly committed to make racial justice a critical element of its operations then in practice it can and should treat it like any other operations issue and audit it as such.” These proponents further argue that Racial Equity Audits should not be viewed as the end of a process for companies and/or shareholders looking to make a change; instead they can be a “stepping stone” to assist companies in developing and identifying a strategic plan to advance their goals.

B. What Impact Can a Racial Equity Audit Have on a Company’s Social Equity Policies and Practices?

The impact a Racial Equity Audit may have on a company may be felt in many ways. Racial Equity Audits can focus on various aspects of a company’s business including the treatment of customers at a company’s physical locations the diversity of senior management the targeting of products and even political contributions. Following an audit some companies have used the findings to develop a strategic plan to capitalize on opportunities to address racial equity moving forward. For example following the voluntary Racial Equity Audit conducted by Starbucks after the 2018 incident discussed above the company began requiring implicit bias training for employees setting public corporate diversity goals and implementing a number of other social initiatives. The public announcement of the Racial Equity Audit and related diversity equity and inclusion efforts appeared to not only rehabilitate Starbucks’ public image after the incident but helped the company become the “most popular restaurant stock on the S&P 500 with actively managed funds that are dedicated to ESG investing” according to RBC Capital Markets.

Racial Equity Audits may also find that a company’s existing policies and practices are not sufficient to address or may be perpetuating systemic social issues. For example in the supporting statement submitted by the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) to its Racial Equity Audit proposal included in the proxy statement for The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (“Goldman”) 2021 annual meeting of shareholders SEIU detailed Goldman’s alleged contributions to systemic racism. Specifically SEIU stated that “Goldman underwrites municipal bonds whose proceeds pay police brutality settlements.” Similarly Trillium on behalf of Christopher and Anne Ellinger submitted a Racial Equity Audit proposal that was included in Johnson & Johnson’s proxy statement for its 2021 annual meeting of shareholders in which Trillium expressed concerns with claims that the company continues to market its talc-based baby powder to “Black and Brown women after its talc supplier included the WHO’s ‘possibly carcinogenic’ label on shipments.” Proponents of Racial Equity Audits argue that a reassessment of internal policies and practices via such audits can identify the right levers to pull to begin to shrink these racial divides.

C. What Is the Democracy Case For Racial Equity Audits?

Civil rights advocates and proponents of social justice have long touted the moral and ethical considerations of closing the racial divide in America. Recently investors and companies have also begun to appreciate that positive financial returns are often associated with investing in initiatives working towards racial equality. Beyond the moral case and business case for conducting Racial Equity Audits and fighting systemic racism in general is the “democracy case” espoused by social justice advocates and that corporations can at times act more swiftly and have a more profound effect on current social issues than the government; therefore these advocates argue that corporations have a responsibility to address issues affecting our democracy. Racial Equity Audits can be designed to help identify if and where these issues exist within a company so that management can address them most effectively.

D. How Racial Equity Audits May Boost Financial Returns and Growth

Some studies have shown that “promoting racial justice can increase profitability and competitive advantage.” A study by McKinsey & Company found that implementing or improving racial justice policies can positively affect a company’s bottom line. As illustrated in the study companies with the highest degrees of ethnic/cultural diversity were 33% more likely to outperform their less diverse peers and companies with the most ethnically/culturally diverse boards of directors are 43% more likely to experience higher profits than their less diverse peers. A study by a Citigroup Inc. (“Citi”) global economist found that addressing racial disparities can have even broader macro benefits. According to this study “closing racial gaps would have generated an additional $16 trillion in economic output since [the year] 2000” and “by closing the various gaps between Blacks and Whites the U.S. could stand to gain an additional $5 trillion in economic activity over the next five years.” Racial Equity Audits could therefore prove to be a critical tool for companies looking to capture some of these unrealized gains.

E. How Investment Managers Especially Pension Fund Trustees Pushing to Address Racism May Be Consistent With Their Fiduciary Duties to Maximize Returns for Investors

A fiduciary’s duty is to act in the best interest of their beneficiaries and traditionally translates to acting to obtain the highest return on investment but it can be equally important that fiduciaries seek to minimize risk. Accordingly it has been argued that working to ensure that systemic risk in the marketplace is proactively addressed via for example a Racial Equity Audit is consistent with a fiduciary’s duties. Advocates of Racial Equity Audits believe that they are essentially intended to be implemented in furtherance of risk management and risk tolerance criteria that fiduciaries may choose to measure in order to protect their investments.

In addition there has also been a rise in ESG-specific funds as well as a growing number of ESG-specific products at mutual funds and other financial institutions. Beyond fund managers’ typical fiduciary duties to minimize risk and achieve positive returns these fiduciaries are explicitly mandated with making investments into companies that “aim to have a sustainable and societal impact in the world” based on ESG criteria or that “meet stringent environmental social and governance standards.” As the usefulness of Racial Equity Audits as a tool for ESG-conscious shareholders to measure a company’s adherence to ESG prerogatives becomes more mainstream it would be no surprise to see support for these audits grow.

F. How Professionals in the Area Believe Audits Should Be Conducted and the Importance of Independent Third Party Reviews

No two companies are identical. Every company has a different mix of products operations and services; therefore according to practitioners in the area it is important for participants in a Racial Equity Audit to identify the scope of the audit and benchmarks prior to conducting the audit. New York State Comptroller Thomas F. DiNapoli a staunch advocate of Racial Equity Audits has stated that such an audit should ascertain at least three things:

First whether a company’s policies practices and products are equitable and nondiscriminatory for employees customers and the communities in which they operate. Second whether any changes to existing programs or new measures or initiatives would help a company become more equitable and inclusive. And lastly whether a company has sufficient mechanisms in place to monitor effectiveness.

Practitioners also stress the importance of auditors using the right methodology including both quantitative and qualitative methods and for such auditors to review not only information provided by the company but to gather its own information. Accordingly auditors are encouraged to solicit information directly through surveys and interviews and to review historical records and a company’s performance against its peers.

Practitioners also believe that the audit process can be important for companies as a way to build trust with their stakeholders. To that end they believe companies should clearly disclose and explain the processes and personnel roles within a Racial Equity Audit and undertake to publicly share the results of the audit. Practitioners also stress the importance of identifying and engaging the “process owners” (e.g. the Chief Executive Officer Chief Legal Officer or Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer) as the persons who will actually drive the implementation of recommended initiatives. Advocates believe it is critical that the audit be conducted by an independent third party in order to ensure integrity and credibility throughout the process. Comptroller DiNapoli has observed that discrimination can be “deep-seated” within a company and “internal self-reviews have the potential to reinforce current structural impediments and biases” which is why he believes it is necessary for audits to be an independent assessment.

G. Which Companies Have Already Conducted Racial Equity Audits How Were They Conducted and What Were the Results?

Some companies have independently engaged in Racial Equity Audits or similar internal reviews usually in response to external pressures. As discussed earlier Starbucks undertook a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”) also conducted its own version of a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. The audit was led by Laura W. Murphy a civil rights advocate with help from a civil rights law firm. The Facebook audit began “at the behest and encouragement of the civil rights community and some members of Congress proceeded with Facebook’s cooperation and [was] intended to help the company identify prioritize and implement sustained and comprehensive improvements to the way it impacts civil rights.” The audit process included interviewing over 100 civil rights organizations several hundred more advocates as well as members of Congress. The aspects of Facebook that the audit focused on were informed by the aforementioned interviews which led to a holistic review of the entire company and not just a single aspect such as employment practices. The audit produced three reports which ultimately described how Facebook utilized the audit process “to listen plan and deliver on various consequential changes that will help advance the civil rights of its users” in a number of categories and also recommended implementation of specific action items including to (1) “continue to onboard expertise” (2) “build out the civil rights leader’s team” (3) “expand civil rights product review processes” (4) “require civil rights perspectives in escalation of key content decisions” and (5) “prioritize civil rights.” The thoroughness of the audit and the response and subsequent actions taken by the company have led to the Facebook audit being heralded by many as a big success.

H. Pushback to Racial Equity Audits

A number of other high-profile companies and financial institutions have been approached either by shareholders or civil rights advocates about conducting Racial Equity Audits. However not all companies have been as eager and willing to comply with these requests. As discussed further below several financial institutions including Citi JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman have resisted shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits stating that they would either fold such measures into their existing human rights assessments or that they didn’t believe it was the appropriate time for such an endeavor.

III: Rule 14a-8 Proposals—The Initial Stages of Advocacy

A. Shareholder Proposals

Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 shareholders may submit proposals to be included in a company’s proxy materials for its annual or special meetings of shareholders. Under Rule 14a-8 a company is required to include a shareholder proposal and related supporting statement in its proxy statement and list the shareholder proposal on its proxy card to be voted on with the company’s proposals if: (a) the shareholder satisfies specified eligibility and procedural requirements; and (b) the proposal is not excludable under Rule 14a-8(i). If the company determines that it is not in the best interests of the company to include a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal in its proxy materials it can (i) seek no-action relief from the SEC staff (the “Staff”) that if granted would allow the company to exclude the proposal without the threat of Staff recommendation of an enforcement action based on a procedural deficiency or a substantive exclusion under Rule 14a-8; (ii) take legal action in court to exclude the proposal; and/or (iii) negotiate with the proponent to withdraw the proposal. Shareholder proposals come from a variety of proponents including individual investors labor unions public pension funds shareholder activists and institutional investors and such proposals often focus on the environment corporate governance executive compensation and social issues. According to Forbes Magazine the past proxy season “set new records with at least 467 shareholder resolutions on environmental social and governance (ESG) issues.”

The Sustainable Investments Institute reports that 28 shareholder proposals dealing with racial justice had been included in proxy statements filed with the SEC as of April 27 2021. Certain of these racial justice proposals submitted by shareholders included proposals calling for Racial Equity Audits. For example the SOC Investment Group formerly known as the CtW Investment Group (“CtW”) a group that works with pension funds sponsored by unions affiliated with Change to Win a federation of unions representing nearly 5.5 million members submitted the following proposal to Bank of America Corporation for inclusion in its proxy statement:

RESOLVED that shareholders of Bank of America Corporation (“BofA”) urge the Board of Directors to oversee a racial equity audit analyzing BofA’s adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil rights organizations employees and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed. A report on the audit prepared at reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary information should be publicly disclosed on BofA’s website.

Similar Racial Equity Audit proposals were submitted by shareholders at several public companies during the 2021 proxy season with substantially the same resolution clause copied above but with different issues highlighted. In general Racial Equity Audit proposals ask the board of directors of a company to oversee such audits analyzing the company’s “business models—from policies to products and services—to determine whether they cause reinforce or perpetuate discrimination.”

B. Why Proponents Submit Racial Equity Audit Proposals

According to public policy analysts racial violence and the COVID-19 pandemic sparked an increase in Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals focused on racial justice. Several of the supporting statements for Racial Equity Audit proposals stated that:

High-profile police killings of black people—most recently George Floyd—have galvanized the movement for racial justice. That movement together with the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused the attention of the media the public and policy makers on systemic racism racialized violence and inequities in employment health care and the criminal justice system.

Proponents contend that Racial Equity Audits would help public companies “identify prioritize remedy and avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color” and would help a company’s board of directors assess such company’s “behavior through a racial equity lens in order to obtain a complete picture of how it contributes to and could help dismantle systemic racism.”

The chart below lists the proponents who submitted Racial Equity Audit proposals to public companies pursuant to Rule 14a-8 during the 2021 proxy season and the number of proposals they submitted:

C. Public Company Resistance to Racial Equity Audit Proposals

Boards of directors of public companies are “[i]ncreasingly . . . called upon to navigate the challenges presented by climate change racial injustice economic inequality and numerous other issues that are fundamental to the success and sustainability of companies financial markets and our economy.” After the May 2020 killing of George Floyd 66% of S&P 500 companies posted statements on their websites or social media accounts 36% made financial contributions to racial justice organizations and 14% stated in their communications that “Black Lives Matter.” While it has been observed that these companies were “quick to issue statements supporting Black Lives Matter and promis[ed] to do more to be responsive to non-white consumers employees and communities” most companies on the receiving end of a Rule 14a-8 proposal to implement a Racial Equity Audit have actively resisted such proposal by seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal from their 2021 proxy statements negotiating with proponents to withdraw their proposals and when the company had been unsuccessful with the foregoing recommending that shareholders vote against the proposals. In doing so these companies have argued that they have already taken measures to address racial justice such as “investing in Black entrepreneurs expanding credit and working to boost diversity within their ranks.”

Companies Sought No-Action Relief . Companies that sought to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals from their 2021 proxy statements by requesting no-action relief from the SEC argued that the exclusions set forth in sections (i)(3) (i)(7) or (i)(10) of Rule 14a-8 applied.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(10) a company is permitted to exclude a shareholder proposal if the company has already substantially implemented the proposal. The Staff has stated that “substantial” implementation under the rule does not require the company to have implemented the proposal in full or exactly as proposed by the shareholder. To demonstrate that they had substantially implemented the audit proposals companies argued they had (i) made pledges and commitments towards racial justice initiatives and made such information publicly available; (ii) issued ESG and/or diversity focused reports; (iii) issued press releases and public disclosures addressing racial inequality; (iv) implemented initiatives to advance racial equity; or (v) financially committed to racial justice initiatives and causes.

Rule 14a-8(i)(7) allows exclusion of proposals related to a company’s ordinary business operations. SEC interpretations of this rule provide that proposals that concern ordinary business matters but focus on significant social policy issues would not be excludable because “the proposals would transcend the day-to-day business matters.” In seeking to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals companies argued that these audits concerned day-to-day aspects of their ordinary business operations including: (i) “product sales and advertising;” (ii) “customer relationships;” (iii) the “nature of the company’s public relations messaging and communications with its shareholders and other constituents;” (iv) “workforce management;” (v) “relationships with suppliers;” (vi) “community impacts;” or (vii) “decisions regarding the products and services [the company] offers.” Furthermore these companies contended that the proposals did not focus on a significant policy issue that transcended their ordinary business.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(3) a shareholder proposal may be excluded from a company’s proxy materials if the proposal or the supporting statement accompanying the proposal is contrary to any of the federal proxy rules including Rule 14a-9 which prohibits a company from disclosing materially false or misleading statements in its proxy materials. The Staff has recognized that exclusion is permitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) if “the resolution contained in the proposal is so inherently vague or indefinite that neither the stockholders voting on the proposal nor the company in implementing the proposal (if adopted) would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty exactly what actions or measures the proposal requires.” Johnson & Johnson the only company to invoke Rule 14a-8(i)(3) during the 2021 proxy season to attempt to exclude a Racial Equity Audit proposal argued that the proposal was impermissibly vague and indefinite because “neither Johnson & Johnson nor shareholders would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty what actions or measures the proposal requires.”

The SEC considered the arguments described above to exclude the shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits and in each case the SEC did not concur with the company that the shareholder proposal should be excluded. Below is a chart listing the shareholder proposals submitted at various companies during the 2021 proxy season the proponent the regulatory basis to exclude the proposal invoked by the company and the SEC’s response to the company’s request for exclusion.

Companies Negotiated with Shareholders to Withdraw the Racial Equity Audit Proposal . BlackRock the world’s largest asset management firm and CoreCivic Inc. (“CoreCivic”) an operator of private prisons have agreed to conduct independent Racial Equity Audits after receiving shareholder proposals for such audits resulting in the proponents withdrawing their proposals. In the financial industry BlackRock’s decision distinguishes it from other financial institutions that have asked shareholders to vote against similar audit proposals and/or have sought no-action relief from the SEC.

Companies Recommended Voting Against Racial Equity Audit Proposals . Most companies who may have been unsuccessful in seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal or in negotiating a resolution with a shareholder to withdraw the proposal have recommended that shareholders vote against the proposals. These companies have asserted that they disagree with the “approach” of Racial Equity Audit proposals but are “aligned with [their] stated goal of addressing racial inequity in the financial sector.”

For example the board of directors of Citi recommended a vote against the Racial Equity Audit proposal included in its 2021 proxy statement noting that “[a]s recently as September 2020 Citi released a 104 page report on the economic cost of Black inequality in the United States titled Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps” and said its efforts on these issues are available to the public. Wells Fargo Co. (“Wells Fargo”) said it is conducting a “human rights impact assessment” and that it will update its Human Rights Statement to better align with the expectations of companies under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Wells Fargo also said it is making efforts toward “expanding [its] diversity and inclusion commitments with a focus on hiring promotions and turnover with increased accountability across all of those areas and [is] taking specific actions in support of these commitments.” The board of directors of Goldman recommended that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on a Racial Equity Audit saying it has taken additional steps toward racial equity in the past year including assessing its “shortcomings” and committing to hiring more analysts from “historically Black colleges and universities while maintaining [its] existing programs focused on other diverse populations.” Goldman also pointed out that it is “[b]uilding upon more than $200 million of grants in minority communities and to minority-owned businesses over the past two decades” and “in 2020 [Goldman] created the Fund for Racial Equity to support the vital work of leading nonprofits that are addressing racial injustice structural inequity and economic disparity which has committed $10 million from GS Gives in addition to matching employee contributions to recipient organizations.”

D. Proxy Advisors’ Positions on Racial Equity Audits

The two leading proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis & Co. LLC (“Glass Lewis”) have generally taken opposing views on Racial Equity Audits. According to Bloomberg Glass Lewis “has broadly said conducting the audits would help companies reduce risks of high-profile controversies that may result in customer and employee attrition regulatory inquiries and significant fines” and that “‘[g]iven broad societal changes it is particularly important for consumer-facing companies’ which depend on their customers’ trust and loyalty ‘to address issues of racial equity.’” On the other hand according to Bloomberg ISS has stated that “racial audits aren’t warranted because companies are taking ‘sufficient meaningful actions’ to address racial inequities such as expanding opportunities for people and communities of color as well as improving the diversity and inclusion of its workforces.” The following chart sets forth the recommendations ISS and Glass Lewis made with respect to each Racial Equity Audit proposal in the 2021 proxy season:

E. Amazon’S Response to a Racial Equity Audit Proposal—A Case Study

During the 2021 proxy season Amazon.com Inc. (“Amazon”) faced a shareholder proposal requesting the company to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. The proposal was submitted by Comptroller DiNapoli as trustee of New York State’s Common Retirement Fund for public employees which owns shares in Amazon. Comptroller DiNapoli was joined by other Amazon shareholders in requesting Amazon’s board of directors to commission a Racial Equity Audit that would analyze two main issues: (1) Amazon’s “impacts on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” and (2) the “impacts of those issues on Amazon’s business.” In response Amazon sent a letter to the SEC seeking to exclude the proposal from its 2021 proxy materials. Amazon argued that regardless of the proposal being “framed in the form of a request for a report” this did not change the fact that the “subject matter of the proposed report is within [Amazon’s] ordinary business” and thus excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

Amazon argued the proposal’s call to review its impact “on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” is a “broad survey on the impact of the Company’s policies practices products and services on societal issues” which implicates “routine business issues” such as “the products and services that the Company offers to its customers the Company’s business practices and operations the Company’s strategic decisions and the Company’s choice of technologies.” Similarly according to Amazon such an audit would “necessarily implicate[] a multitude of ordinary business matters relating to the Company’s day-to-day operations” which Amazon argued included decisions relating to among other things its charitable donations hiring decisions diversity and recruitment initiatives customer relations advertising public relations and communications with its shareholders and the kinds of products it sold. Despite the laundry list of examples Amazon cited in its No-Action Letter the SEC did not concur that the proposal was excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

In a webinar hosted by CtW Comptroller DiNapoli explained the importance of racial equity at Amazon and why shareholders should vote in favor of the proposal and argued that “racial inequity is harming the United States economy.” DiNapoli argued that “the pattern and magnitude of issues repeatedly facing the company demonstrate a need for a more in-depth review . . . Concerns related to workforce diversity treatment of minority workers environmental justice in communities of color surveillance and civil rights are just some of the controversies that have troubled Amazon.” For example current and former Amazon employees have accused the company of allowing racism to permeate its operations. The company’s environmental impact has also been called out for allegedly disproportionately affecting minority communities. Comptroller DiNapoli expressed concern with Amazon’s alleged lack of transparency stating that while the company has put policies in place to address this issue it “has not reported to investors the effectiveness or the process for completing its ongoing policy review.” In 2020 Amazon conducted its first human rights assessment which it referenced to support its position that there was no need to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. However Comptroller DiNapoli noted “a human rights assessment is not the same as an independent racial equity audit and shareholders should be weary of equating the two.”

On May 26 2021 Amazon shareholders rejected eleven shareholder proposals at the annual meeting. Among these the proposal for a Racial Equity Audit garnered the most support with 44% of the votes cast on this proposal voting in favor. Comptroller DiNapoli described the vote as “an immense success for a first-time proposal . . . [i]f CEO Jeff Bezos’ shares (70616270 shares 14%) were to be removed from those voting ‘against’ it the proposal received majority support.”

IV: The Focus of Racial Equity Audits on the Financial Industry

Financial institutions and asset management firms have become the focus of Racial Equity Audit shareholder proposals. According to CtW this focus is based on the belief that:

the finance industry has played a critical role in perpetuating unequal wealth distribution to communities of color. Whether it be modern day ‘redlining’ techniques related to mortgage loans to excessive checking account fees to most recently Payday [sic] Protection Program distribution communities of color have faced decades of discrimination as a result of the financial industry’s policies and practices.

While the financial institutions that have received Racial Equity Audit proposals have recently made philanthropic and strategic investments along with other commitments to racial equity CtW has stated that “the only way to effectively address racial injustice and economic inequality is careful study of how the industry’s products and services have contributed to this imbalance” which includes analyzing mortgage issuances the number of bank branches in minority neighborhoods or “banking deserts” and whether charitable contributions are “fully aligned with . . . public statements.”

A. An Outlier in the Financial Industry—BlackRock Agrees to a Racial Equity Audit

BlackRock’s response to the Racial Equity Audit proposal that SEIU submitted for inclusion in its proxy statement was an outlier among the other financial and asset management firms that faced similar proposals. Like the other companies that received shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season SEIU’s proposal urged BlackRock to “assess its behavior through a racial equity lens to identify how it contributes to systemic racism” including where its stated values are misaligned with the impact of its actions. The resolution included in SEIU’s proposal also noted that:

A 2020 report on proxy voting found that BlackRock did not use its clout as a significant owner to advance racial justice. BlackRock opposed nearly all shareholder proposals directly addressing racial justice issues including two proposals at Amazon seeking disclosure regarding hate-promoting products and effects of its facial recognition technology on people of color.

According to SEIU BlackRock “decided that the SEIU proposal is too important to wait until they are voted on at their shareholder meetings” and announced its plans to voluntarily conduct an independent racial audit of its operations. As a result the shareholder proposal was withdrawn and SEIU announced that it was currently working with BlackRock to bring about “needed change within the company and the financial services industry.” Commentators anticipate that BlackRock’s commitment to a Racial Equity Audit “could sway other financial services companies to follow in its footsteps.”

V: Developments for Future Proxy Seasons

A. Racial Audits May Be Here to Stay

ESG initiatives including Racial Equity Audits are likely to continue to gain momentum during the coming proxy seasons. As ESG issues garner more media attention and as younger generations move into the investing space these issues and related disclosures may become increasingly important to consumers investors and other stakeholders. Racial Equity Audits could emerge as a critical tool for companies to evaluate their current social impact and provide an objective method for investors to monitor their investments and potentially identify new companies that could benefit from increased social and economic engagement.

While we witnessed an increase in shareholder proposals related to Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season all such proposals were either withdrawn or defeated. However as Racial Equity Audits become more commonplace and enter the cultural norm these proposals may begin to resonate with more stakeholders and be approved by shareholders as early as the next proxy season.

B. Proactive Companies May Try to Cut These Initiatives Off at the Pass

In light of the anticipated increase in the number of Racial Equity Audit proposals in the coming proxy seasons we may see a corresponding rise in the number of companies that follow BlackRock’s lead and voluntarily conduct their own Racial Equity Audits. Proponents of Racial Equity Audits warn that such audits should be conducted in a robust manner by fully independent third parties and that the subject companies take action to address deficiencies shortcomings and concerns uncovered by the audits. Otherwise these proponents posit a lackluster or hastily conducted Racial Equity Audit or failure to take meaningful action in response to an audit may actually have the opposite effect for the implementing institution—instead of insulating the company from potential proposals demanding Racial Equity Audits faulty or perfunctory audits may instead create a target on the institution’s back for ESG activists in the following years.

C. Proxy Advisory Firms Likely to Weigh In

No major proxy advisory firm has issued official voting guidance on the implementation of Racial Equity Audits—and the two largest advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have been split on their support for shareholder proposals requesting such audits. However in the coming years we believe this is an area in which the proxy advisory firms may issue official voting guidance. On July 28 2021 ISS launched its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey which included requests for feedback on Racial Equity Audits. ISS will use the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey as a “key component of ISS’ annual policy development process to assess potential policy changes across regions and markets for 2022 and beyond.” While ISS has largely appeared hesitant to support Racial Equity Audits in the circumstances presented in the 2021 proxy season the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey could change its future guidance and recommendations on such audits. As the area develops (and if more companies voluntarily implement these audits) Racial Equity Audits could become viewed as good corporate governance particularly if top proxy advisory firms issue official guidance supporting the implementation of such audits.

The proxy advisory firms’ level of guidance may take varying forms—at the low end proxy advisory firms may increase a company’s ESG or corporate governance “score” for having in the past or recently conducted a Racial Equity Audit. At the higher end proxy advisory firms may offer official guidelines on what they believe are minimum actions a company should take with respect to Racial Equity Audits in order to receive the advisor’s support. For example such guidelines may provide for a minimum frequency of Racial Equity Audits and indicate parameters on what attributes an audit must possess to be considered sufficient. In this case failure to have a Racial Equity Audit policy or refusal to implement such a policy after shareholders have approved a proposal to implement one may become a criteria an advisory firm would consider in making a recommendation for or against the re-election of a company’s chairperson of the governance committee and/or the re-election of other directors at the company’s annual meeting.

Clear guidance from proxy advisory firms would also be beneficial to companies considering implementing Racial Equity Audit policies by offering indications on what parameters constitute “best practices” and how frequently these audits should occur. By offering such guidance companies may find it easier to voluntarily implement Racial Equity Audit policies.

D. Potential Legislative or Regulatory Mandates

Even with an increase in the number of shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits it is possible that companies may not adopt them as quickly or as widely as the public and/or certain legislative bodies would prefer. If this occurs legislators and/or regulatory authorities may at some point in the future step in to close the gap between investor demand and practical implementation. We saw this occur in California with Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 discussed in further detail above. As the general public’s views evolve on ESG issues public pressure for certain actions—in this case increased diversity in public boardrooms—often influence not just shareholder advocacy but legislative action. The California legislature recognized the public desire to move towards greater diversity on public boards and codified set requirements. In this way legislatures and/or regulatory authorities have the ability to serve as the catalyst for change and wider-reaching adoption by forcing companies that might have been unlikely or slow to act on their own to adopt such policies.

Indeed the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion is currently reviewing legislation that would require banks to conduct Racial Equity Audits every two years in an effort to promote diversity and equity. The proposed Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act would require such audits by independent third parties of the subject companies’ “policies and practices pertaining to civil rights equity diversity and inclusion.” The initial debates on the draft legislation also considered adding to the draft bill penalties for non-compliance including fines of up to $20000 a day for failure to engage in such audits. The draft legislation would also require banks to investigate what ties they may have to slavery and disclose steps such institution would take to reconcile profits it may have received from slavery. The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Joyce Beatty and co-sponsored by Reps. Nikema Williams and Jesus G. Garcia and is currently under committee review.

Other external forces that may prompt public companies to adopt Racial Equity Audit policies are the SEC and the securities exchanges. Currently neither the SEC nor the major U.S. securities exchanges mandate publicly traded companies to make disclosures regarding Racial Equity Audit initiatives. However on August 6 2021 the SEC approved new listing rules proposed by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) requiring each Nasdaq-listed company to disclose certain information about the diversity of its board of directors and generally include a minimum number of members of its board of directors who are Diverse (as defined within the new listing rules). Accordingly as Racial Equity Audits become an increasingly important area for investors it is possible that the SEC and the major exchanges may eventually require companies to make further diversity equity and inclusion disclosures which may include the existence and frequency of a company’s Racial Equity Audits.

Legislative or regulatory requirements are not without their own risks and compliance with any such minimum standards would not be fool proof to insulate a company from potential ESG proposals and proxy campaigns. Racial Equity Audits and similar equity and inclusion initiatives that are not robust or designed with the aid of independent third party consultants may risk being perceived as mere “window dressing” and invite criticism from shareholders.

E. Companies Should Stay Informed in This Area

Given current trends in ESG public companies should stay informed on Racial Equity Audits and their adoption crafting and implementation. Further companies wishing to stay ahead of the curve may start by critically and objectively looking at their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion and identifying areas in need of improvement. If a company lags behind in this quickly developing area we believe shareholders may become more willing to launch shareholder campaigns focused on ESG issues including demanding objective results through Racial Equity Audits.

22Supra note 10. The most recent and prominent example of the intersection between shareholder activism and ESG was the 2021 proxy contest at Exxon. Exxon has faced pressure from shareholders to shift practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon faces proxy fight launched by new activist firm Engine No. 1 Reuters Svea Herbst-Bayliss Gary McWilliams December 7 2020 available at https://www.reuters.com/article/exxon-shareholders-engine-no-1/exxon-faces-proxy-fight-launched-by-new-activist-firm-engine-no-1-idUSKBN28H2IO. Shareholder activist Engine No. 1 grew impatient with Exxon after years of declining financials and long-continued dependency on fossil fuels with no indication of future change. Id. As a result Engine No. 1 launched a proxy campaign in December 2020 to effect change on Exxon’s board of directors. Id. The activist investor nominated a slate of four director candidates with expertise operating energy companies and utilizing clean technology. Id. Dismissal and neglect of these concerns led to Engine No. 1’s unprecedented victory with three of its director nominees being elected to Exxon’s board at its 2021 annual meeting—sending a clear message that environmental concerns and proactive planning are deeply important to Exxon’s shareholders.(go back)

The position had its challenges — don’t seat too many people in one section or that server will be slammed but don’t underseat in another or that server will hate me — but the worst part was that through lulls and through rushes I had to stand up.

I’d clock in and take my position at the podium near the door. For the remainder of my shift there I was: standing sometimes for seven or eight hours. As I moved through food service jobs in the following years I began to think of work as consisting of two categories: sitting down and standing up.

In a country that hasn’t raised its federal minimum wage since 2009 the right to sit down may not be at the top of the list of workers’ demands but for many who are subjected to arbitrary standing for hours on end it is certainly on the list. While there are downsides to sitting-down jobs (as any office worker will tell you it’s not great on the body or the mind to spend day after day hunched over a computer screen) the pointless discomfort of having to stand while performing work that could easily be done from atop a stool or a chair is particularly grating.

Cashier is one of the more obvious such positions. In the United States most grocery stores require cashiers to stand at their checkout station. Merely leaning against a surface can bring repercussions — as many a manager has irritatingly put it “If you have time to lean you have time to clean.” The subject comes up every once in a while when a social media post about the issue goes viral. One such tweet for example reads “Honestly the fact that American supermarket cashiers don’t get to sit down (?????) is sufficient grounds for revolution by itself.”

A notable exception is ALDI which allows cashiers to sit down. The chain is German-owned — in Europe it is common practice for cashiers to be seated. Yet ALDI which has around two thousand stores in the United States is ruthless in its pursuit of high productivity and low labor costs; it allows cashiers to sit because its data suggests this arrangement boosts speed. The chain monitors cashiers’ rate on the register pushing them to scan more than one thousand items an hour and leaving customers to bag their own groceries. It staffs at low levels with workers responsible for a range of tasks during the shift and the chain’s practice of slapping many barcodes on every item is a means of speeding up the checkout process too. ALDI requires customers to cough up twenty-five cents to get a shopping cart (they do get their quarter back when they return the cart) saving the chain the labor cost of having workers round up scattered carts in the parking lot.

Rather than expecting an employer to adopt the right to sit out of its own goodwill standards are emerging through class action lawsuits. California’s Supreme Court broadened a right to sit down in 2016 after CVS Pharmacy cashiers and JPMorgan Chase bank tellers sued their employers for violating the state’s wage orders which provide that “all working employees shall be provided with suitable seats when the nature of the work reasonably permits the use of seats” a regulation originally adopted in 1911 to apply to women working in retail. The cases were brought through the Private Attorneys General Act which provides workers with a private right of action against employers for labor code violations.

In Kilby v. CVS Pharmacy Inc. workers argued that the phrase “the nature of the work” refers to discrete tasks such as ringing up items and that seating should be provided as an option when those tasks are being performed. This was in contrast to employers’ desire for a more wide-ranging determination of the phrase one that takes into account all the activities a worker performs during her shift as well as the boss’s judgment and the layout of the workplace.

While the court did not entirely agree with the workers it ultimately came down closer to their side ruling that employees cannot be denied a place to sit solely because an employer prefers that they stand. “There is no principled reason for denying an employee a seat when he spends a substantial part of his workday at a single location performing tasks that could reasonably be done while seated merely because his job duties include other tasks that must be done standing” wrote Justice Carol A. Corrigan.

California workers have brought class action lawsuits against several employers since the ruling. In 2018 Walmart agreed to pay $65 million to 100000 cashiers in California for violating the standard. Despite agreeing to provide suitable seating going forward the megacorporation has since been sued once again by workers who say it has not done so. Bank of America too settled a lawsuit by its California tellers for $15 million while Safeway settled a case for $12 million.

So long as workers are told to stand when they could sit the issue will continue to be one of the many frustrations of working in the United States. It needn’t be. If California can back workers’ right to sit down there’s no reason the rest of the country can’t do so. Grocery workers have risked their health and safety during the pandemic performing work that was celebrated as “essential.” If there was ever a time to let them take a load off it’s now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2h5LWFtZXJpY2Fucy1jYW50LXN0b3AtYnV5aW5nLXNob3BwaW5nLWFkZGljdGlvbi1zdHVmZi1jb25zdW1lci1zcGVuZGluZy0yMDIxLTEw0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS93aHktYW1lcmljYW5zLWNhbnQtc3RvcC1idXlpbmctc2hvcHBpbmctYWRkaWN0aW9uLXN0dWZmLWNvbnN1bWVyLXNwZW5kaW5nLTIwMjEtMTA_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 reasons why Americans can't stop shopping for stuff,"It's the year of buying stuff.

Americans won't stop buying stuff.

Spending on durable goods has soared over the past 18 months per a new JP Morgan note.

It's partly because of a new way of life and in other ways it finally marks a recovery from the Great Recession.

Americans just can't stop shopping.

Since the pandemic hit the US 18 months ago they've been buying way more stuff than they were in the 2010s. While service spending still dominates the economy getting double the amount of investment as goods Americans are just buying so much stuff these days.

It's kind of a problem how much stuff Americans are buying. It's giving the economy a much-needed boost: Spending growth for goods has surpassed pre-pandemic levels with a 25.69% increase from January 2019 to August 2021 a recent Insider calculation of Bureau of Economic Analysis data found. It's the first time in decades that spending on goods has increased so much.

However consumer habits also are crippling our economy. Americans' record-breaking shopping habits have led to the US running out of all kinds of goods as Insider's Emma Cosgrove reported.

A year ago the American shopper was in virtual hibernation and it was anyone's guess when lockdown would end. Now we know they've been spending with a vengeance.

A lot of the goods that Americans are buying are durable according to a Monday note from JP Morgan's Bruce Kasman meaning things that will be used for at least three years such as furniture cars and electronics. But why are they buying so many of them?

The bank broke down four driving forces behind Americans' seeming addiction to shopping right now.

The experience economy shut down

With months-long lockdowns and lingering restrictions across the country throughout much of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 there were little to no services to spend on.

Traditional entertainment spending was down by more than 90% year-over-year as early as May 2020 according to a Bank of America Research note at the time. With limited experiential opportunities JP Morgan said a little over a year later Americans diverted their spending power toward durable goods.

As the country slowly reopened vaccinated consumers began to return to out-of-home activities with plans to spend extra on experiences like travel and restaurants. Since the spring Americans have been eating and drinking out more and more. But service spending is recovering more slowly than goods.

Americans are shopping for a new kind of homebound life

​​Shopping for goods remains elevated partly because Americans are ""reconfiguring life for the pandemic era"" per JP Morgan. This required upfront investments in everything from personal tech for a work-from-home set-up to cars for avoiding mass transit.

It's a similar story for home goods. A year inside the homebody economy and a flurry of homebuying led to a spike in spending on private or homebound matters. Americans bought everything from furniture and appliances for home improvement projects to loungewear and kitchen necessities as they worked and cooked from home. A McKinsey report from May found that consumers intend to continue the investments they made in their home life post-pandemic.







Furniture and home improvement spending are up by 36% and 35% respectively for the week ending October 23 compared to the same week two years ago per a Bank of America Research note by a team led by economist Michelle Meyer.

There were stimulus checks to blow

Each of the three stimulus checks passed from April 2020 through March 2021 led to a big jump in goods spending. JP Morgan said

The checks and the decline in discretionary spending that accompanied the pandemic led to Americans holding $2.6 trillion in excess savings as of mid-April per Moody's Analytics. In May they were spending more than they did before the pandemic Insider's Ben Winck reported citing Visa data.

While many used their stimulus checks as financial assistance like paying off debt they also likely used them to invest in the goods they needed for a lockdown lifestyle.

Goods spending is finally catching up after a post-Great Recession slump

There's also the fact that spending on durable goods had been depressed since the 2008 financial crisis relative to long-run trends according to JP Morgan. ""That doesn't explain why the normalization happened all at once during the pandemic but it does caution against expecting a slump in durables demand"" the bank said.

During the Great Recession spending on durable goods fell by 12% – way more than the 3% drop in nondurable goods per data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Spending on cars auto parts furniture and household items fell the most and didn't recover to pre-recession levels until after 2013.

Cars and furniture just happen to be two of the areas that saw the most spending since the pandemic began. Perhaps then the newfound importance these items took on during a pandemic era was enough to help even out the Great Recession's overall decline in goods spending."

And it’s got plenty more strategy jobs in the pipeline.

Kaushik Viswanadha joined the tech giant CEO’s office earlier this month in a regional business operations job.

Viswanadha comes from Standard Chartered which bases many of its top strategy people in Singapore and is therefore an obvious headhunting ground.

He was with Stan Chart for about three and a half years latterly as a director of global strategy. His remit included digital transformation new business ventures and digital assets.

Viswanadha has joined Grab during a hiring spree for Singapore-based strategy jobs. Grab needs more strategists and consultants on board to help it transform into a “super app” and prepare for its Nasdaq-listed SPAC a deal which is expected to take place by year-end and which values the company at more than US$40bn

Grab has 39 Singapore-based vacancies in its business development and strategy category. These span a broad range of its business – from digital banking to grocery deliveries. There are senior roles on offer including a head of merchant strategy and execution.

The poaching from banks – Stan Chart Citi DBS OCBC and UOB are the likely targets Grab is likely to poach people from the Big Four and from consultancies such as McKinsey and Bain. Viswanadha started his career with a five-year stint at the former firm.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

School Board approves raise for teachers,"BATH CO. Ky. (WKYT) - At last months meeting Bath County School Board members approved a 2% raise for teachers. After some backlash the board reconvened and approved a larger 5% raise this time.

“The districts that have the funds are raising their teachers salaries. We are in a position where we don’t have the economic advantages the other districts have. So if we don’t at least try to compete at least to a 3% on the yearly rate we fall farther and farther behind” said Superintendent Steven Evans.

Superintendent Evans said he’s pushed for a 5% raise because many teachers are looking at positions in other districts or have already left. And he said he can’t blame them.

“Eventually it doesn’t make sense to become a teacher in this county when you can drive down the road and make $10000 more dollars.”

It’s these teachers who filled the board meeting and applauded after learning they’d receive the larger raise.

“This opportunity to give 5 our finance director says she can never remember doing a 5%. So it’s not a game changer but it’s a good boost in the arm for them. And they deserve it.”

All classified personnel will receive a $1 per hour raise as well. Many classified personnel make under $20 per hour and wouldn’t have been eligible for the percentage raise otherwise.

The board previously approved a $1000 stipend with the 2% raise. The stipend was removed with the larger raise tonight.

The Vanguard Self Storage facility is being built at the former Regency Laundry site on the A36 Lower Bristol Road.

The reception area will feature a restored De Haviland Vampire aircraft adding a unique touch.

Vanguard Self Storage one of the UK’s remaining independent providers of self-storage solutions say the new facility marks a significant milestone in their strategic expansion.

The property which had been a laundry dating back to the 1880s had been purchased by a residential developer but faced a rejected planning application.

Vanguard seized the opportunity making an unconditional offer and completing the acquisition in January 2022.

Will McCullagh Managing Director of Vanguard Self Storage said: “We are excited to bring our high-quality self-storage services to the heart of Bath.

“Our new facility not only provides convenient and secure storage solutions but also showcases our dedication to sustainable design and environmental responsibility.”

It has been designed by Bath architects Designscape to blend seamlessly with the city’s architectural heritage.

Vanguard say: “Utilising a combination of Bath stone glazing and bronze cladding the building’s exterior pays homage to the local aesthetic while incorporating modern design elements.”

Mike Lamplough Vanguard’s Head of Property said: “We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible storage experience From the architecturally sensitive design to the state-of-the-art amenities our new Bath store exemplifies our dedication to excellence.”

Sustainability is at the forefront of the project. Key features include a 75kWp solar array on the roof electric vehicle charging bays and a new stream landscape feature that re-naturalises the existing waterway running across the site as well as landscaping to contribute to the promotion of natural habitats.

The new facility will offer 45000sq ft of net lettable storage space spread across four floors and served by two 3.5-tonne Kone lifts.

Each unit will be individually alarmed and the site will be monitored 24/7 by CCTV.

Ben Thilthorpe Head of Operations at Vanguard said: “Following the success of our Bristol store which we opened in 2019 we anticipate that our new Bath branch will be very attractive to business customers.

“We will have units that will be ideal for micro and small companies and a drop-in business lounge.

“The fact that we are only a five-minute walk from the city centre means that we will be providing the perfect location for final mile logistics.”

The Bath store is the latest addition to Vanguard Storage’s growing network of facilities across the UK.

The company have also announced the completion of expansion projects at its Staples Corner and Bristol locations as well as the installation of a new 295kWp solar PV array at their Manchester site."

According to a social media post from the Lumpkin County Sheriff's Office no foul play is suspected and an investigation is ongoing. Sheriff Stacy Jarrard asked for thoughts and prayers for Baxter's family and friends and he thanked local first responders for their help in locating Baxter.

Baxter was last seen on Friday Oct. 22 on the UNG Dahlonega campus where he was a student. His family members took to social media for help in locating him posting on the Facebook account North Georgia Hiking & Adventure. Posts asked for other hikers to join the search since Baxter was described as an experienced hiker who liked to hike off-trail.

Baxter's vehicle was found in a parking lot in the Woody Gap area according to last week's social media posts from the family. They also said some witnesses had seen him heading in the direction of Springer Mountain. Search crews combed popular hiking spots including Woody Gap to Preacher's Rock to Dockery Lake as well as from Woody Gap to Gooch Gap. Volunteers and authorities showed flyers with Baxter's photo to hikers along the way but no one reported seeing him.

The search for Baxter was called off on Wednesday after crews thought Baxter was no longer in the Woody Gap area.

The memorial includes an abstract depiction of Field Punishment No1 for which men were tied to posts and had their hands tightly bound behind their backs for hours at a time during World War 1.

Opening the Archibald Baxter Peace Garden yesterday Mr Robertson said the punishment was a gross and inhumane form of state-sponsored torture.

‘‘I want to say sorry ...it was wrong.’’

Mr Robertson said the apology was personal rather than officially from the Government and he acknowledged the suffering of conscientious objectors.

It was appreciated as a significant moment by Archibald Baxter Memorial Trust chairman Prof Kevin Clements.

The memorial was complementary to the Otago Peninsula Fallen Soldiers' Memorial and honoured ‘‘a different kind of courage to say no to war’’ Prof Clements said.

Prominent pacifist Archibald Baxter and 13 other objectors were forced aboard a troopship bound for Britain in 1917 and then the front line.

They were subjected to cruelty as well as moments of humanity Prof Clements said.

He told the gathering at yesterday’s ceremony the memorial was 10 years in the making and the site at the corner of George and Albany Sts was accepted after two false starts.

Archibald Baxter's granddaughter Katherine Baxter flanked by Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson (left) and Otakou leader Edward Ellison told family of other conscientious objectors ‘‘this is your place’’.

Several speakers including Mr Robertson referred to the 1881 invasion of Parihaka which happened the same year Mr Baxter was born.

The government of the day chose to crush the peaceful resistance at Parihaka.

‘‘It’s incredibly important that we acknowledge all of our history when it comes to war peace and conflict and in New Zealand we have a lot of memorials to those who fought and that’s the right thing’’ Mr Robertson said.

‘‘But it’s very timely to have one to those who showed the courage of their convictions to be conscientious objectors.’’

Asked about Covid-19 vaccine mandates which essentially require sectors of the workforce to be vaccinated Mr Robertson said this was driven by public health needs.

Some people believed deeply they should not receive the vaccine but this was a different realm from principled pacifism he said.

Baxter family representative Katherine Baxter said it had been a long-awaited day.

The memorial and peace garden would be a lovely space in the middle of the bustle of Dunedin she said.

Dunedin Mayor Aaron Hawkins was bemused that the memorial project had faced resistance 100 years after pacifists endured suffering in World War 1.

However the trust’s painful journey to drive the project to completion bore no comparison to the suffering endured by the conscientious objectors themselves.

The design of the memorial was led by Paddy Baxter and the sculpture was by Shane Woolridge.

He said he was “disturbed” by a design that would cram the students into a 1.7-million-square-foot 11-story building and make the vast majority of them live in small rooms without windows “wholly dependent on artificial light and mechanical ventilation.”

“In the nearly fifteen years I served as a consulting architect to the DRC no project was brought before the committee that is larger more transformational and potentially more destructive to the campus as a place than Munger Hall” he wrote in the letter. “The basic concept of Munger Hall as a place for students to live is unsupportable from my perspective as an architect a parent and a human being.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY2hhcmxpZS1tdW5nZXItdWNzYi1hcmNoaXRlY3QtbWVnYS1kb3JtLXRpbnktbm8td2luZG93cy0yMDIxLTEw0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9jaGFybGllLW11bmdlci11Y3NiLWFyY2hpdGVjdC1tZWdhLWRvcm0tdGlueS1uby13aW5kb3dzLTIwMjEtMTA_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Architect quits in protest over Charlie Munger's UCSB mega dorm,"A plan for UCSB's Munger Hall

UCSB



An architect on the University of California Santa Barbara's ""mega-dorm"" project quit over concerns about the project.

The project known as Munger Hall is primarily financed by Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman the billionaire investor Charles Munger.

The plan contains 4536 beds for UCSB undergraduate students and is 1.68 million square feet.

Construction of a mega-dorm at the University of California Santa Barbara primarily funded by Charlie Munger is moving ahead school officials said even after an architect on the project reportedly quit in protest about the living conditions.

Munger Warren Buffett's longtime right-hand man and Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway donated $200 million toward the project known as Munger Hall with the condition that his blueprints be followed exactly according to the Santa Barbara Independent.

But earlier this week Dennis McFadden a consulting architect on UCSB's Design Review Committee (DRC) for over 15 years left the project the university confirmed in an email to Insider.

According to the Independent McFadden quit in protest calling the large project and nearly windowless plan ""unsupportable from my perspective as an architect a parent and a human being.""

Munger Hall's proposed plan contains 4536 beds for UCSB undergraduate students and 8 one-bedroom staff apartments according to records by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research in California obtained by Insider.

A majority of the dorm's single occupancy bedrooms do not have windows. The structure in its entirety will be 11-stories tall and approximately 1.68 million gross square feet.

""The Munger Hall project and design is continuing to move forward as planned"" a spokesperson from UCSB told Insider. ""We are delighted to be moving forward with this transformational project that directly addresses the campus's great need for more student housing.""

UCSB's total enrollment for 2020-2021 includes 23196 undergraduates according to its website. There are currently eight university-owned and operated residence halls at UCSB which house over 5000 students. After Munger Hall is completed the university will be able to house less than half of its undergraduate students on campus. The housing rate for UCSB's residence halls varies between $15072 and $20656 per academic year.

Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment on Munger's involvement in the project.

The project has been slammed by architects who say the many windowless rooms sound like a prison not a dorm.

McFadden expressed concern in his letter of resignation that the university has not offered any data to support this style of housing and its impact on students. McFadden called the project a ""social and psychological experiment"" with no known ""impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates"" at UCSB according to the Independent.







""An ample body of documented evidence shows that interior environments with access to natural light air and views to nature improve both the physical and mental wellbeing of occupants"" he wrote. ""The Munger Hall design ignores this evidence and seems to take the position that it doesn't matter.""

UCSB did not respond to Insider's request to comment on McFadden's concerns for the well-being of students that will live in Munger Hall.

""We are grateful for Mr. McFadden's contributions and insights during his tenure as an advisory consultant"" the spokesperson said.

McFadden told the Independent he decided to resign when the project plans appeared to be set in stone after a meeting in early October.

""In the nearly fifteen years I served as a consulting architect to the DRC no project was brought before the committee that is larger more transformational and potentially more destructive to the campus as a place than Munger Hall"" McFadden told the paper.

This isn't Munger's first foray into funding university construction projects.

Munger designed the Munger Graduate Residencies at the University of Michigan which opened in 2015. The billionaire donated $110 million to the project in 2013 according to a 2019 article on Munger's college-related projects by the Wall Street Journal. Munger's original plan for the residencies included housing for approximately 300 students. In its final execution Munger Graduate Residencies currently houses about 600 students many of whom live in apartment-style rooms without windows the article says.

Munger hopes that when his project at UCSB is complete ""it will be widely regarded as the best in the world"" he told the Journal. Comparing his project to Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt Munger says ""it isn't that the Jews didn't get to the Promised Land it's just that Moses didn't get to… That's OK. This will all come to fruition after I'm dead"" the Journal article quotes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy85LXdheXMtZm9sbG93aW5nLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LTE3MDAwMDQzMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9 ways Warren Buffett's frugal habits can help you save money like a billionaire,"9 ways Warren Buffett's frugal habits can help you save money like a billionaire

He might have billions of dollars to his name but unlike other celebrities and financial gurus Warren Buffett prefers to live life simply.

The investing icon practices what he preaches when it comes to financial discipline saving and paying off debt.

Buffett warned a livestream audience of over 28 million during Berkshire Hathaway's May 1 annual meeting that ""substantial inflation"" is hitting both retail prices and wholesale prices being charged to businesses. When one of the world's most successful investors raises concerns about rising prices it's likely time to apply some well-tested strategies to tighten your belt.

Here are nine ways Buffett's frugality can help you save and spend wisely.

1. He lives in the same home he bought back in 1958

While most billionaires bulk up on expensive real estate Buffett originally paid $31500 for his Omaha Nebraska home — that’s around $288700 in today’s dollars — and he’s lived there for over 60 years.

His home is by no means tiny however. The 6570-square-foot five-bedroom home has had plenty of renovations and additions over the decades and is worth about $1 million today. It’s also protected by fences and security cameras and most likely has a good homeowner’s insurance policy as well.

Buffett has no plans to move out calling it “the third best investment I ever made” in a 2010 letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders.

2. He rarely takes out loans

Buffett’s one-and-only mortgage was on a vacation home in Laguna Beach CA which he purchased in 1971 although he certainly had the cash to afford the $150000-listed seaside property.

He told CNBC that he took out the 30-year-mortgage loan because “I thought I could probably do better with the money than have it be an all-equity purchase of the house.” He decided to use the extra cash on hand for shares in Berkshire Hathaway — the company that brought him billions — instead.

Buffett's point about not locking up capital still resonates. And if you own your home you have options to free up some of your capital by refinancing at today's historically low mortgage rates. A switch today can save you thousands of dollars a year.

3. He buys breakfast cheap

@BusinessInsider / Twitter

While Buffett could simply hire a personal chef to cook him gourmet meals he often grabs his breakfast from Mickey D’s on his way to work. He doesn’t spend more than $3.17 on his morning meal.

“When I’m not feeling quite so prosperous I might go with the $2.61 which is two sausage patties and then I put them together and pour myself a Coke” he says in HBO's documentary Becoming Warren Buffett. He continued saying “$3.17 is a bacon egg and cheese biscuit but the market’s down this morning so I’ll pass up the $3.17 and go with the $2.95.”

Story continues

Instead of going out for big meals or buying a latte from Starbucks every day just make your own lunches and coffee. You can even get rewarded for buying your groceries and earn cashback for future spending.

4. He buys marked-down cars

Many billionaires and millionaires keep a collection of flashy sports cars and vintage models in their garages but Buffett allegedly prefers fixed-up automobiles that he can acquire at reduced prices.

He upgraded from his 2006 Cadillac DTS to a Cadillac XTS for just $45000 in 2014. ""The truth is I only drive about 3500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently” he admitted to Forbes.

Whether you’re opting for a brand-new car or a slightly-used model you shouldn’t overspend on vehicles so don’t go for the first loan you spot and look around for better deals. Make sure to shop for auto insurance rates every six months as well.

5. He doesn’t splurge on brands

Buffett doesn’t much care for designer suits or the latest iPhone model — he relied on his $20 flip-phone for years before swapping it out for the Apple smartphone in 2020. And despite the upgrade he doesn’t use any of the iPhone’s fancier functions.

Buffett avoids unnecessary spending and once said “Do not save what is left after spending but spend what is left after saving.”

Park your funds in a high-yield savings account so they can accumulate interest and grow over time. Set aside your extra cash for an emergency fund or retirement instead of blowing it all on big purchases.

6. He doesn’t invest with borrowed money (anymore)

Freedomz / Shutterstock

“I’ve never borrowed a significant amount of money in my life. Never. Never will. I’ve got no interest in it” he told students at Notre Dame in 1991.

Although a young Buffett once borrowed 25% of his net wealth to buy shares he warns investors against repeating the same mistake.

Even skilled stock traders will tell you borrowing to invest can be risky. And with easily downloadable apps like this one that lets you invest your ""spare change"" and turn your pennies into profits there's no real need.

7. He does what he loves

Financial Freedom / YouTube

Buffett credits some of his success to his passion for investing. “You have to love something to do well at it” he says urging people to take the jobs they love instead of positions that look good on your resume.

Even if you can’t quit your full-time job to focus on the things you truly enjoy you can certainly find the time for some affordable hobbies. Buffett himself enjoys card games and playing the ukulele.

And if you’re looking for a way to boost your income capitalize on your skills and hobbies and set up your own side hustle.

8. He finds creative ways to save

When Buffett’s first child was born he converted a dresser drawer into a bassinet. For his second he borrowed a crib.

“If you buy things you don’t need you will soon sell things you need” the billionaire says. Buffett watches out for the small expenses before they can add up and comes up with creative solutions to avoid spending more than he has to.

Take a good hard look at your finances and figure out where you can cut down on. Get yourself a library card and borrow books and movies instead of purchasing them. Or download a budgeting app to monitor your spending habits.

9. He uses cash not credit

While most of us prefer the convenience of a credit card for our everyday purchases Buffett uses hard cash.

He told Yahoo! Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer in 2019 that he uses cash “98% of the time. If I’m in a restaurant I’ll always pay cash. It’s just easier.” While the method may sound a bit old school relying less on your credit card can help prevent spending money you don’t have.

Using most of your available credit and falling behind on your monthly payments damages your credit score. If you’re struggling to pay off your credit card debt you might want to consider bundling it up into a debt consolidation loan with a lower interest rate.

The problem many have is that 94 percent of the rooms Charlie Munger's proposed $1.5billion new living quarters at the University of California at Santa Barbara are on the interior of the building and have no windows.

One consulting architect dislikes the project - known as Munger Hall - so much that he quit it completely and wrote a letter explaining his decision.

'The basic concept of Munger Hall as a place for students to live is unsupportable from my perspective as an architect a parent and a human being' California architect Dennis McFadden wrote in the letter.

McFadden argued that the design doesn't fit in with the campus or the environment that surrounds it

Charlie Munger (pictured right) is the vice chairman of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway

Munger donated $200million to the University of California at Santa Barbara to build Munger Hall based solely on his designs

Munger wants the 1100 residents to spent time in common areas rather than their own rooms

A floor plan shows off one of the buildings' 'suites' which will house eight people each

'Even the rooftop courtyard... looks inward and may as well be on the ground in the desert as on the eleventh floor on the coast of California' McFadden wrote.

McFadden went as far to compare the population density to that of Bangladesh and criticized that there were only two points of entry and exit.

'The project is essentially the student life portion of a mid-sized university campus in a box' McFadden wrote. 'Munger Hall is an experiment in size and density with no precedent in student housing at that scale.'

Munger 97 is the vice chairman of Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway company. He donated $200million to the school to fund the dorms with the promise that his designs be followed. His grandson is a UCSB alum.

He funded a similar building at the University of Michigan through a $110million donation.

His logic he claimed is that he wants residents to spend more time meeting each other outside their rooms in common areas.

'Architecture is a field where tastes vary and everyone thinks he's an expert. And no two architects ever agree on anything' Munger said.

McFadden doesn't like the idea of a single person's design going into the making of the dorm with what sounds like a gimmick.

'As the 'vision' of the single donor the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the University serves' he wrote.

Munger Hall if finished is set to be an 11-story building with over 4500 beds. Each floor would have eight 'houses' that hold 63 students with eight 'suites' in each house and eight beds per suite.

The suites also each have two bathrooms and a common area.

UCSB confirmed the project will go on as planned despite McFadden's resignation. They added that all campus housing is 'developed through an extensive campus participatory process with the assistance of Urban Design Associates.'

Munger donated $110million to have this building erected on the campus of the University of Michigan

UCSB claims it's facing a housing crisis with a waitlist of over 1000 students searching for somewhere to live

Munger has no doubt he's at the start of a new trend in student housing.

'When this thing goes up and becomes an extreme success which is absolutely inevitable I think there will end up to be more buildings like it on the UCSB campus' Munger said.

However the rooms do have artificial windows which Munger said resemble the Disney cruise ship's artificial portholes where 'starfish come in and wink at your children' the Santa Barbara Independent reported.

UCSB said in a statement that the building will go forward as planned. The university also said all of the current housing projects are guided by a campus plan which was 'developed through an extensive campus participatory process with the assistance of Urban Design Associates.'

The school says it's facing a housing crisis with a waitlist of over 1000 students searching for somewhere to live.

'One of the reasons and there are many for the project is to address the University's substantive housing needs' Banvard said. 'Good and affordable housing for students in a very competitive housing market.'

Munger promises that he only means well for the students of the school.

'I'm a product of education public education' Munger said. 'And I know how important schools are and the architecture of schools is so naturally I drifted toward giving dormitories.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMS8xMC8zMC91Y3NiLWRvcm0tY2hhcmxpZS1tdW5nZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Architect Dennis McFadden quits over Charlie Munger’s UCSB mega dorm,Munger vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to universities and high schools to build school facilities he designed himself.

That's the main difference between the $500 (£450 AU$749) Xbox Series X and $300 (£250 AU$499) Xbox Series S. Unless your life is ruled by FOMO if money is any object the console choice clearly comes down to talking yourself into buying the Series X rather than talking yourself out of it. And If you want a fan model like the Xbox Series X Halo Infinite Limited Edition your only choice is the Series X; it's in preorder now and slated to ship in early November.

If you want one of the consoles now though or are trying to decide between the two for holiday gift giving note that both are in short supply but it's easier to find the Series S than the Series X. Newbie gamers will likely be happy with the S. But a lot of more seasoned gamers pooh-pooh the Series S with its lesser storage capacity and components as not a very future-proof choice.

Yes technically the Xbox Series X has more memory and beefier processing components that run at faster speeds than the Series S but it's all in service of hitting 4K and 120 frames per second while gaming without upscaling. Or it's 8K/60 frames per second with it -- if you think you need it.

The Series S' target of 1440p and 120 fps is a lot less demanding hence its lower-power components and smaller body. For streaming video the Series X can do native 4K and upscale to 8K while the series S upscales to 4K.

Watch this: Xbox Series X and Series S Offer a Fine-Tuned Streamlined Xbox Experience 05:19

The Series S comes with only 512GB of SSD storage compared with the Series X's 1TB but thanks to Smart Delivery games optimized for the new consoles won't take up as much space on the Series S as the Series X. If you want to keep a lot of big games on deck and in progress the Series S supports the same Velocity Architecture for SSD expansion either via swapping the NVMe or the pricey (relative to the price of the console) Seagate 1TB plug-in card. Whizzy new game features are designed to be compatible with both and they have the same support for the new wireless controller and other peripherals.

Microsoft's offering both with its two year Xbox All Access bundles -- that's its plan for leasing an Xbox plus a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate -- with the Series X for $35 a month and the Series S for $25.

Microsoft Xbox Series S The biggest challenge for a living-room-bound Series S is finding a TV that supports the 1440p maximum resolution natively rather than forcing it to dial back to 1080p. Most TVs do 1080p or 4K (or both). But if the console is cohabiting with your workspace there are a ton of compatible monitors you can connect to it. The Series X may look better but if you're playing on a monitor-sized screen you won't miss the 4K as much. The Series S is a much better deal if you're planning to sign up for Xbox All Access. Once you subtract the price of the console you end up paying about $12.50 a month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate compared to its solo $15 monthly rate. If you have an older console though you may be able to get the Series X for as little as $300 with a trade-in. Read the Xbox Series S review. $300 at Best Buy

Microsoft Xbox Series X If you've been gaming at 4K on an Xbox One X you may want to shell out the bigger bucks and upgrade to this model. You'll be able to get a higher frame rate with the One S but that's at the expense of resolution. If you're used to playing in 4K 1440p might look soft to you. But that will depend on the size of your screen and your visual acuity. Xbox All Access isn't a terrific deal with the Xbox Series X. At $35 a month once you subtract the price of the console you're shaving only about 80 cents off putting the console on your credit card and subscribing separately to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. (If you don't have a credit card remember that in order to sign up for the plan you still have to pass a credit check with Microsoft's third-party financing company Citizens One. The latter is the only way to subscribe to All Access as well.)

Of course there aren’t many Chrome OS tablets in the market but still: This is the latest one to consider. And there are plenty of things I really like about this small 11-inch slate. In fact I like it more than when I shared my first impressions. Is it worth your consideration and budget though? I’d say yes provided you can find it on sale compared to its $599.99 regular price. I explain why in this HP Chromebook X2 11 review.

(Update: In a stroke of good timing the HP Chromebook X2 11 I reviewed is currently on sale at Best Buy for $399. At that price I think most buyers will be happy but read the full review for additional thoughts.)

Excellent design look and feel

I think most of the excitement surrounding the HP Chromebook X2 11 is around the overall design. It’s warranted too: Compared to prior Chrome OS tablets this is a looker. And it has some nice hardware features that are omitted on other older slates.

For starters the 11-inch touchscreen is a joy to look at it thanks to its 2160 x 1440 resolution touch panel. The screen is bright at 400 nits and has excellent color and viewing range as well as reasonably small bezels. I enjoy using this display both for consuming content as well as general web use.

The device itself is made from aluminum and as I alluded to before looks like an iPad at first glance. I’d call that a pro not a con but that’s just me. What it really means is that the tablet feels solid and well made. Without any plastic involved I can’t flex the device and display at all.

Aside from having the two USB Type C ports on the lower left of the side HP has made great design choices with the rest of the slate. Yes it’s great to have two USB ports but I’d prefer to see them on opposite sides.

The top left power button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor though? It’s awesome and is quick to log me into the HP Chromebook X2 11. I’m fine with the volume rocker and microSD card slot next to the USB ports on the left as well. That leaves space for the included HP stylus on the right side where a magnet holds and charges it.

And perhaps the best part are the accessories with one exception.

These are similar to those included with last year’s Lenovo Duet Chromebook but a smidge better in some ways. The magnetic kickstand strongly attaches to the back of the display and offers a wide range of custom angles for example. The detachable keyboard is likewise thoughtfully designed even attaching to the bottom of the display for a better typing angle and for more stability on your lap. I find the keyboard acceptable but not great to type on and the trackpad is also average.

However this particular component falls short for me personally for one specific reason. I know this is a 2-in-1 Chrome OS tablet with a detachable keyboard and not a laptop. But the point of adding a keyboard to a slate is to create a laptop-like form factor. If you’re going to use this device on a flat surface like a desk or table you’ll be fine. But using it on a lap for me has been a letdown.

The keyboard attachment has far too much flex in it for that purpose. I can’t get past the many times that lightly resting a palm triggers a mouse click when using the HP Chromebook X2 11 on my lap.

And it’s not just me: I’ve read a few reviews that mention the keyboard as a con. That’s a shame because the idea of a portable device like this is to provide usability on the go in almost any scenario.

Is the performance representative of a $600 Chrome OS device?

Moving the focus away from the overall design and general usage let’s talk about what’s inside the HP Chromebook X2 11.

Due to timing and likely other issues HP chose Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c compute platform to power the X2 11. That chipset was introduced in 2019 so keep your performance expectations in check. Initially didn’t see much performance difference between this device and last year’s Lenovo Chromebook Duet. After spending more time with both however I have seen that the X2 11 runs a little smoother and slightly faster than the Duet when performing the exact same tasks. It’s not a huge performance jump but it’s there.

I see a little more pep from the X2 11 when opening apps or browser tabs for example. Switching between applications in overview mode is consistently smoother too. So is opening and running most Android apps that I tested although I wouldn’t buy this as an Android tablet replacement.

It’s possible likely even that having double the memory of the Duet is helping the X2 11 but does that matter? You’re getting a marginally better experience

Perhaps the best way to offer some tangible insight are benchmark numbers. Just keep in mind these are general performance indicators.

Note that I’m including another Chrome OS tablet you can still buy used for less: The old Pixel Slate. And for reference the recent Lenovo IdeaPad 5i with its new Pentium CPU. No that’s not a Chrome OS tablet however this is included simply as a reference point between CPUs available in entry-level devices. It’s more of a “bang for your buck” inclusion since that Chromebook is priced less than the HP Chromebook X2 11.

Test Lenovo Chromebook Duet

Clearly the comparison numbers between the Chromebook Duet and the HP Chromebook X2 11 show the latter has more performance power. Some numbers might suggest it but don’t think it’s twice as fast in most use cases.

Make no mistake however: This is still a lesser performer than most other recent entry-level devices that cost much less. I’d say you’re buying the HP Chromebook X2 11 for the portability factor over productivity usage.

That doesn’t mean you can’t use the device for being productive. I’ve done it for a full week. And aside from comparative slowness from other devices that cost less it’s fine. But the strength of this tablet is really when you want to watch something or do some light work in bursts in various places.

What else is on the inside of the HP Chromebook X2 11?

I’ve covered the display and processor attributes so here’s a rundown on the rest of the hardware in terms of specifications:

CPU Eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c compute platform up to 2.4 GHz GPU Qualcomm Adreno 618 GPU Display 11-inch IPS 2160 x 1440 display glossy finish

3:2 aspect ratio 400 nits brightness Memory 8 GB DDR4x-2133 MHz memory Storage 64 eMMC storage

microSD card slot for expansion Connectivity 802.11ac (2×2) WiFi 5 Bluetooth 5.0 Input Non-backlit detachable keyboard multitouch trackpad

5M wide view webcam and 8 MP wide view rear camera

Dual-array microphones and included stylus Ports 2 USB Type-C SuperSpeed ports with 5 GB transfer speeds

supporting PD data and DisplayPort 1.2 Battery 32 WHr expected run-time up to 11 hours Weight 2.57 pounds with accessories Software Chrome OS automatic updates through June 2029

You’re not getting the fastest USB Type-C speeds memory connectivity or storage here. But that’s fine for a small portable Chrome OS tablet. For many buyers this is more of a secondary device than a primary one. Keep in mind that there’s no headphone jack so you’ll need a pair that supports Bluetooth or USB Type-C. The Bang and Olufsen dual speakers don’t sound any different than on most entry-level Chromebooks either.

The webcams are like many other aspects: acceptable and functional but not great. And the stylus falls into the same category although that could be due to a lack of optimized writing or drawing apps. I see some annoying pen latency depending on the application. Still using the stylus is handy.

And kudos to HP for their battery claims. No I never saw the “up to 11 hours” of run time. But I did hit 10 hours once and averaged between 8 and 9 hours of usage on most days. The included 45W USB Type-Charger is fairly quick as well so in just about an hour you can fully recharge your tablet.

Should you buy the HP Chromebook X2 11?

If you’re specifically looking for a light and portable Chrome OS solution this device is worth considering. No it’s not the fastest by any means but the use case of general web usage on the go is filled here. However at the full price of $599.99 I’d say wait. Just wait for a sale as we’ve seen the price dip down to $379. At that price you’re getting a much better value. At full price I think you’re overpaying for what you’re getting.

Another way to look at this. I’ve seen many HP Chromebook X2 11 buyers very happy with their purchase. They’re not looking for a powerhouse device. But nearly all of them bought this tablet at a discount. I’m sure there are a few people happy with their $599.99 purchase however I haven’t heard from any of them. If you’re in either camp let me know how you feel about the device and if you purchased it for less than the full retail price.

Keep in mind too: The Lenovo Duet 5 Chromebook with a next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c is available now and costs $499. That chip is mainly the same as the first-gen CPU but is clocked slightly higher.

You keep the 8 GB of memory and get double the storage. Yes this is a larger device with a 13.3-inch OLED 1080p touch panel. But in a laptop scenario you’re less constrained by the keyboard size. This detachable Chrome OS tablet weighs 1.5 pounds without the keyboard and kickstand so it’s likely to weigh a little more than the HP Chromebook X2 11 yet still be nearly as portable.

Or if a smaller display better keyboard and half-step less performance fit the bill the Lenovo Chromebook Duet can be had for $300 or less. It really depends on how much performance you’re looking for in a portable Chrome OS tablet.

In fact we're already seeing some great early AirPods Black Friday deals and Beats headphones deals ahead of the online sales period.

If you are looking for a new pair for yourself or as a gift for Christmas it's well worth checking out our buying guides for the best AirPods and best Beats headphones to get a general understanding of what each product offers in terms of features and how much they'll cost you.

But if you can only buy one AirPods or Beats product which should you choose? While Beats is owned by Apple there are some big differences between Beats headphones and Apple headphones - and lots of similarities too. There's really no right or wrong answer as there's a variety of headphones and earbuds to suit a variety of styles and budgets. In this guide we'll be comparing each brand directly to help you figure out which pair is the right fit.

AirPods vs Beats Price

Prices vary significantly between AirPods and Beats brands but the four AirPods products (those being the AirPods Pro AirPods Max AirPods 3 and AirPods 2) are on average more expensive than their Beats counterparts.

AirPods are definitely Apple's premium range of audio products the cheapest of which being the AirPods 2 at $129 / £119.

They were given a permanent discount when the AirPods 3 launched with Apple;s latest buds costing $179 / £169. The AirPods Pro are the next tier up costing $249 / £249 putting them at the pricier end of the true wireless earbuds market.

Finally the AirPods Max are the only over-ear headphones available in the range and they're not cheap at $549 / £549 which is very steep (even if they do sound incredible).

The Beats Powerbeats Pro. (Image credit: Beats)

If you're on a tighter budget then or if you're not happy with the relatively slim amount of options in the AirPods lineup then a pair of Beats might just be for you.

Immediately you have two fantastic options in the form of the on-ear Beats Solo Pro and over-ear Beats Studio 3. Both are significantly more affordable than the AirPods Max at $299.95 / £269.95 for the Solo Pro and $349 / £299 for the Studio 3. Still by no means cheap but very worthwhile alternatives to the AirPods Max.

On the smaller side we have the Beats wireless earbuds and the two we'd recommend are the Beats Studio Buds which cost $149.99 / £129.99 and the Beats PowerBeats Pro which retail at $249 / £219.

If these price points are still a bit out of your range it's worth keeping an eye on the Black Friday deals. Most of the aforementioned products are known to be discounted over the sales period and we're already seeing early deals for both AirPods and Beats products.

Waiting for Black Friday is a great idea as you're likely to net a 20 - 30% discount on AirPods and potentially up to 50 - 60% off Beats products as we've seen in previous years. We expect AirPods to have smaller discounts over the sales period but are likely to sell out faster given their closer ties to the Apple ecosystem. Beats headphones will certainly be more readily available in this regard and will probably feature steeper discounts.

AirPods vs Beats: design

Both the AirPods Pro and AirPods 3 have very basic yet elegant designs for wireless earbuds. But if comfort is important to you then the AirPods Pro are preferable in this regard. Not only do they fit better than the AirPods 3 they also allow for interchangeable eartips including memory foam tips if you so desire.

The AirPods 2 are exactly the same as the original AirPods with protruding stems and a 'one-size fits all' approach. Not everyone will like the design of the second-gen AirPods but they're undeniably popular.

The AirPods Max also certainly deliver on the comfort front with a knitted mesh fabric that's easy on the ears. However it's worth noting that these cans are a little on the heavy side so those of you who are sensitive to on-head pressure might prefer a lighter pair of Beats.

Speaking of Beats comfort seems to have been more of a priority from Apple here. The Beats Solo Pro are a supremely comfortable pair of on-ear headphones that feature some pretty dense cushioning. The exact same can be said for the Beats Studio 3 so either is a great pick in this regard. And ultimately we think comfort should be an important factor for anyone. After all headphones can only sound so good if they're constantly irritating the sides of your head.

Heading on over to Beats earbuds the Beats Studio Buds are among the most comfortable in the business especially at their relatively affordable price point. The charging case features a nice rounded design too.

The PowerBeats Pro feature more of a specialized design that's perfect for exercise. These running earbuds are designed with a secure fit in mind meaning they're the ideal choice for anyone who exercises or runs on the daily.

Finally we have to say that Beats headphones and earbuds win on the aesthetic front. While there is something to the said for the simplicity of the AirPods Beats products are usually available in a variety of different colors. This is a great thing for anyone looking to add a splash of color to their outfit.

AirPods vs Beats: audio performance

Older models of AirPods earbuds such as the AirPods 2 had a reputation for sounding a little tinny almost as if you were listening to the music through a plastic cup. However Apple has stepped up its game since then with the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro; and while their sound isn't quite class-leading (that accolade has to go to Sony's WF-1000XM4 true wireless earbuds) both have support for Spatial Audio giving them a fuller richer sound profile overall.

The AirPods Max are quite different in this regard. They simply sound phenomenal rivalling the competition when it comes to best-in-class sound. However a lack of hi-res audio support means they fall just short of a wholehearted recommendation from us. The AirPods Max are also purely wireless with no 3.5mm headphone jack meaning you're stuck with Bluetooth connectivity if you buy these cans.

Beats headphones and earbuds meanwhile have a bit of a reputation for sounding extremely bassy. That's both a positive and a negative. If you wear headphones while working out that extra pump of bass can give you the push you need to set new personal bests or just to get the most out of your exercise.

On the other hand the less-balanced audio could turn audiophiles away especially if you're looking for a cleaner listening experience - and this is what lets down slightly older models like the Studio 3 or Solo 3 headphones. Thankfully later Beats models tend to be more balanced in sound and much better for a casual listening experience. These include the Beats Studio Buds and Beats Solo Pro which offer an overall cleaner sound.

AirPods vs Beats: features

Both AirPods and Beats are manufactured by Apple but the former are most optimized for the iPhone ecosystem. If you own an iPhone iPad or a Mac then you'll be able to get the most out of a pair of AirPods with extra features like Spatial Audio an adaptive EQ that aims to adjust to the best possible sound depending on your surroundings and integration with the Siri voice assistant.

Beats headphones and earbuds are also preferably used with Apple products but many work just fine with Android devices too. More recent Beats products make use of Apple's H1 chip bringing them more in line with the AirPods feature set. These include the Solo Pro over-ears and (potentially) the rumored Beats Fit Pro tipped to be launching in November.

That's not the case for all Beats headphones though. The Studio Buds use a proprietary Beats headphone chip as opposed to the H1 chip found inside the AirPods Pro. That’s good news for Android users – but it does mean that the Studio Buds don’t support iCloud device syncing or multipoint pairing like the AirPods Pro.

Moving onto battery life AirPods have improved in recent years but there's nothing class leading here. Beats products fare much better in this regard not least of all the Solo Pro which can last up to 40 hours from a single charge. The AirPods Max can hit up to 20 hours with active noise-cancelling enabled which is respectable but still falls short of its Beats counterpart.

Most contemporary AirPods and Beats iterations do feature active noise cancellation as a standard feature. Active noise cancellation (or ANC for short) is the act of dimming or removing background noise around you while wearing your headphones or earbuds. This could be anything from other peoples' conversations to even rain and traffic on models with stronger ANC.

Over-ear headphones tend to fare better with ANC over earbuds as evidenced by the fantastic ANC offered by the AirPods Max and Beats Solo Pro. However earbuds are catching up with both the AirPods Pro and Beats Studio Buds offering decent ANC. The one exception here are the AirPods 3 which unfortunately don't have active noise cancellation as a feature.

AirPods vs Beats: takeaway

Both AirPods and Beats products have some excellent features no matter which pair or brand you end up going with. While AirPods are typically priced much higher than Beats they offer better sound quality overall and stronger integration into the Apple ecosystem make AirPods the ideal choice for owners of iPhones Macs and more.

There's a wider range of Beats products and they tend to be more affordable but that doesn't make them any less worthwhile. The bassy sound profile might be just what you're looking for on some models and their high level of comfort and color options also make them a solid choice if you care about style. Battery life tends to be higher all round with Beats too meaning they'll last longer without needing to charge.

There's strong pros and cons to both AirPods and Beats then so be sure to keep in mind the above information when shopping on Black Friday. And of course we'll keep you posted of any and all excellent discounts for both AirPods and Beats products on before and after the sales event.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGxlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL2NvcnB1cy1jaHJpc3RpLWNhbGxlci10aW1lcy0yMDIxLWJlc3QtbGlzdC13aW5uZXJzLWZpbmFsaXN0cy82MDM4MzU1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Caller-Times Best of the Best: Here's a list of all the winners,"Staff reports

For proof all you need to do is ­unpack the Biden administration’s so-called Environmental Social Governance agenda and its ties to BlackRock the world’s biggest money-management company headed by Larry Fink which manages more than $9 trillion in assets.

BlackRock has been an active cheerleader for White House policy toward ESG — the practice of prodding industries to enact climate-control measures and adopt other lefty shibboleths such as board diversity as part of their business models — and profit from it without attracting much attention from the usual suspects.

Since his days on the campaign trail Joe Biden has made no secret that he wants much more government in the economy. Now that he’s president Biden’s Securities and Exchange Commission is no longer intent on merely protecting small investors from financial fraud; it now wants to reverse climate change by imposing ESG standards on all public companies that mandate disclosure of their carbon footprint.

Corporate governance used to focus on what companies can do to deliver profits over the long haul. No longer. The Treasury Department’s Financial Stability Oversight Council recently identified “climate change as an emerging and increasing threat to US financial stability.”

It doesn’t end there. The Biden Labor Department is now proposing a new rule that would force companies and their 401(k) sponsors to include investments that adhere to ESG standards. To make room for these new ESG offerings the best-performing funds will take a back seat to funds that adhere to the woke mandates.

Again the revolving door is nothing new; big business is always looking for ways to shape government policy in ways that serve its self-interest. What’s different here is how big of a role people associated with Larry Fink’s BlackRock have taken in formulating national ESG policy and how much the company stands to profit from it with barely a peep from that aforementioned gotcha crowd.

For those who don’t know Fink he’s one of the most fascinating powerful and woke figures on Wall Street. His firm runs money for individuals businesses and governments across the globe also managing the Fed’s massive portfolio of debt off and on since the 2008 financial crisis.

Fink is a billionaire and his success enabled him to become a key player in the Democratic Party. And he hasn’t been bashful in deploying BlackRock’s clout to advance Democratic economic causes in ways that happen to support its bottom line.

3 Larry Fink is a “woke” investor writes Charles Gasparino. Brendan McDermid/REUTERS

Last year he famously wrote an open letter threatening to push for the removal of board members of companies BlackRock invests in if they refuse to toe the progressive line on climate change.

More recently he has vowed to make ESG a centerpiece of BlackRock’s investing model. As Eleanor Terrett of Fox Business has reported BlackRock now offers more than 150 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (investment pools that trade like stocks) that adhere to ESG standards — more than any other firm on Wall Street.

BlackRock manages more than $400 billion in ESG client money which means it’s making money hand over fist being an environmentally aware corporate citizen since according to Terrett these funds can carry fees that are as much as 40 percent higher than other similar investments. (BlackRock counters that its ESG ETFs are cheaper.)

Fink meanwhile has some important help in advancing this profitable ESG investing model. As it turns out the Biden administration is stocked with former BlackRock people who are doing the same on a national regulatory level.

Take Brian Deese the current head of the National Economic Council. He was Fink’s global head of sustainable investing. Or take Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo. He was Fink’s former chief of staff and is one of the top advisers to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who is a key player in the national ESG push.

There are other BlackRock people serving in the Biden administration with more tangential ties but who are powerful nonetheless. They include Michael Pyle BlackRock’s former global chief investment strategist. He’s now chief economic adviser to VP Kamala Harris. Then there’s Tom Donilon chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute. His brother Mike Donilon is Biden’s senior adviser and chief campaign strategist.

The White House didn’t return calls for comment. BlackRock said in a statement that “climate risk is investment risk. We do believe that limiting the impact of climate change is better for the economy and will lead to higher growth.” Fink for his part may really believe climate control is necessary for mankind to survive. Deese who according to his latest White House disclosure held $2.4 million in BlackRock stock may also be pushing for government policies without thinking twice about how it benefits his old firm.

But appearances do matter. And the appearance of a revolving door between BlackRock and the White House deserves more scrutiny.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtxZWQub3JnL25ld3MvMTE4OTQ0NTMveW91dGgtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1hY3RpdmlzdHMtY2FsbC1vdXQtZnVuZGVycy1vZi1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW9z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,News Radio Podcasts TV | Public Media for Northern California,"Climate demonstrators gathered outside the San Francisco headquarters of investment management company BlackRock on Friday as part of a global day of action demanding financial institutions ""defund climate chaos"" — end funding of corporations that perpetuate climate destruction.

The day of action which took place in at least 100 cities around the world was timed ahead of COP26 the United Nations climate conference beginning in Glasgow on Sunday.

The Bank on Our Future campaign says that stopping the funding of asset managers like BlackRock would help stop the flow of funding for oil and gas.

At least 200 kids left school in a climate strike joined by survivors of wildfires across the state and Indigenous leaders. Eight demonstrators blocked the entrances to BlackRock’s building throughout the day and two were arrested after hanging a banner saying ""Investments set the world on fire from CA to Amazon #DefundClimateChaos"" from the nearby Salesforce Transit Center.

Vanguard’s smart beta offerings are winning the race for investors’ cash this year even as BlackRock’s iShares funds remain the market leaders.

iShares’ smart beta ETFs posted assets of $491bn as of September 30 — the highest among US fund providers according to data from Morningstar Direct the research group.

However iShares’ flows in the first nine months of 2021 were less than half the level that Vanguard’s smart beta funds garnered over the same period. Vanguard’s $315bn smart beta line-up — the second largest among ETF providers — raked in $31bn over the nine months to September 30. iShares funds meanwhile drew in $11.7bn.

Together iShares and Vanguard’s assets accounted for 65 per cent of the $1.24tn in US smart beta ETF assets according to Morningstar. Their combined inflows made up nearly half of the $91bn that went into smart beta ETFs in the first nine months of 2021.

Vanguard has been successful in smart beta because its low-cost offerings are straightforward compared with those of its rivals reckons Ben Johnson director of global ETF research at Morningstar.

Many smart beta funds are complex to explain to investors and are targeted at delivering exposure to specific stockpicking factors — such as growth value or momentum — which may go in and out of favour as markets shift he points out. But Vanguard’s funds tend to make smaller factor bets and are usually tilted towards a single factor Johnson explains.

“Vanguard’s funds are easier to understand easier to own” he says. “You’re not going to see the same level of volatility same level of tracking error than if you were to invest in pure growth or value funds.”

BlackRock meanwhile maintains its foothold in smart beta by identifying untapped niches says Lukas Smart head of US sustainable and factors at its iShares division.

In October iShares launched its USD Bond Factor ETF (USBF) which selects bonds based on macro quality and value factors. The asset manager also plans to launch an ESG version of its $27.7bn USD Bond Factor ETF. That fund will invest in US companies that have lower volatility characteristics as well as reduced carbon exposure and improved environmental social and governance characteristics compared with those in its MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Extended ESG Reduced Carbon Target Index (MVEA).

The intersection of sustainable investing and factor-based investing is rife with opportunity Smart believes.

Despite BlackRock and Vanguard’s dominance data suggest that rivals are catching up. Invesco’s $106.9bn smart beta ETF line-up which is the third largest in the sector brought in $11.4bn during the first nine months of 2021 according to Morningstar. Charles Schwab’s $80bn smart beta ETFs drew a combined $12.8bn over the same period and the group is the fourth-largest provider of such funds.

Providers are attempting to gain market share by putting smart beta ETFs into the context of a diversified portfolio Morningstar’s Johnson says.

“Asset managers are increasingly building factor variants of model portfolios” he notes.

Charles Schwab has made inroads with registered investment advisers through its ETF model portfolios that include its smart beta funds says David Botset head of strategy and product for Schwab Asset Management Solutions. Its models are available to advisers in paper form and through wealth management platforms such as Envestnet and Riskalyze he adds.

Schwab differentiates its smart beta line-up by showing clients how its funds can provide them with income that they may be challenged to find through fixed income funds in the current low-interest rate environment Botset says. The fund manager like BlackRock also looks to add products in underserved niches he adds.

iShares’ smart beta assets of $491bn are the highest among US fund providers

In April Schwab Asset Management launched its Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF (SCHY) and the fund had brought in more than $130m by mid-October.

Meanwhile First Trust aims to differentiate itself from larger rivals through multi-factor ETFs instead of factor tilts or single-factor strategies says Ryan Issakainen senior vice-president and ETF strategist at the asset manager.

First Trust identifies factors that work together at different times he says. “We have a complementary factor approach where we may look at value alongside quality with each [factor] having the potential to enhance the other” he says.

First Trust is the fifth largest smart beta ETF provider with $60bn in assets as of September 30 according to Morningstar. Its line-up brought in $8.2bn in the first nine months of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcm9idG9ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC8zMS93aWxsLXRoaXMtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1vZi1jbGltYXRlLXRlY2gtYmUtZGlmZmVyZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will This Generation Of “Climate Tech” Be Different?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2021/10/31/will-this-generation-of-climate-tech-be-different/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcm9idG9ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC8zMS93aWxsLXRoaXMtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1vZi1jbGltYXRlLXRlY2gtYmUtZGlmZmVyZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNocnVnYnkuaWUvMjAyMS8xMC8zMS9ib3lsYW4tYmFncy1oYXQtdHJpY2stYXMtYmxhY2tyb2NrLWdvLXRvcC_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmlzaHJ1Z2J5LmllLzIwMjEvMTAvMzEvYm95bGFuLWJhZ3MtaGF0LXRyaWNrLWFzLWJsYWNrcm9jay1nby10b3AvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boylan Bags Hat-Trick As Blackrock Go Top,"With two games cancelled in round five Blackrock College took advantage to move to the top of the table as young full-back Maggie Boylan scored a hat-trick of tries against Malone.

ENERGIA WOMEN’S ALL-IRELAND LEAGUE: Saturday October 30

BLACKROCK COLLEGE 52 MALONE 7 Stradbrook

Scorers: Blackrock College: Tries: Michelle Claffey 2 Maggie Boylan 3 Jackie Shiels Ciara Scanlan Anna Potterton; Cons: Jackie Shiels 6

Malone: Try: Emma Jordan; Con: Holly Brannigan

HT: Blackrock College 31 Malone 0

Former Ireland international Jackie Shiels starred with 17 points as Blackrock ran out eight-try 52-7 winners over Malone at Stradbrook.

Moved in to out-half Shiels had a commanding presence in a ‘Rock team missing their 15s and Sevens internationals. Another player to catch the eye was Munster’s Boylan who continues to show her finishing ability.

Boylan claimed a trio of tries adding to the four she recently scored against Wicklow. The Dubliners’ strong scrum laid the platform for the likes of the 20-year-old Boylan and two-try captain Michelle Claffey to convert chances.

Malone skipper Peita McAlister typified their battling spirit which was rewarded with a well-taken Emma Jordan try during the latter stages of the second half.

Blackrock quickly went about their business Casey O’Brien breaking off a scrum and feeding the inrushing Claffey for a powerful finish from the edge of the Malone 22. Shiels converted from straight in front for 7-0.

The visitors spent some time in the ‘Rock half out-half McAlister trying diligently to create some space for the outside backs. They did have numbers on the right but their passing let them down.

Malone kept pressing and managed to build some decent phases the highlight being a barnstorming run by prop Chrissie McKee. Again though they had nothing to show for plenty of endeavour.

Blackrock were much more clinical prop Aoife Moore carrying hard up into the 22 from a quick tap. The backs soon took over getting the ball wide for Boylan to cut in past a defender and score in the left corner.

Shiels missed the conversion just before the first water break but she added the extras to her own try a neat finish in between two defenders following some patient build-up play from Ben Martin’s charges.

Boylan made it 24-0 with a strong fend and burst of pace to make it over in the left corner before nice hands from the Malone forwards saw winger Jordan darting deep into Blackrock territory.

An interception led to further frustration for the Cregagh Red Sox who watched ‘Rock break downfield through Natasja Behan. Centre Ciara Scanlan accelerated through a gap to go in under the posts with Shiels converting.

Turning around with a 31-point deficit Malone made good early headway until ever-alert winger Behan turned them over in contact.

The ball was moved wide to the left wing where the speedy Boylan scampered through cutting inside her opposite number Holly Brannigan to complete her hat-trick.

Shiels swept over the extras and a rip in the tackle soon set the wheels in motion for ‘Rock’s next try. A lovely run from Claffey took her outside one defender and inside another as she glided in under the posts.

Shiels’ reliable right boot took it out to 45-0 but the visitors deservedly got off the mark a few minutes later. McAlister’s flat pass off a scrum sent Jordan hurtling through a couple of tackles and in under the posts.

The try was topped over with the conversion from Brannigan but Blackrock had the final say when lock Anna Potterton crashed over from close range following a sniping run by lively young flanker Hannah Hodges.

If 5-foot-8 185-pound Trey Howe is built like a truck then the 6-foot-3 260-pound Furno says he’s “more of an airplane.”

As for fellow senior captain Josh Mateo who is 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds?

“A little hot wheel car” Furno said. “But like a fast one.”

Despite the difference in appearances for the three (of four) Blackstone Valley Tech captains the talented threesome is leading the way on the gridiron for the Beavers this fall.

“They’re just dynamic together” BVT interim head coach Anthony Landini said. “With them being captains as well they bought into the system and they’re a main reason why we’re going to have a good shot.”

BVT (4-2) has reeled off four straight victories – while averaging 39 points during that winning streak – after heartbreakingly losing its first two games.

And over the past two weeks the trio of Furno Howe and Mateo finally got their chance to play together – all three of them – for the first time since their season opener. The result: blowout wins over Abby Kelley (33-8) and Bay Path (55-14) to close out the regular season.

“Our different strengths together make us versatile and unpredictable” Howe said. “We are all weapons and can play in any situation. We strive off of each other’s energy on the field.”

Back out on the field

Mateo’s left hand started to hurt early on in the fourth quarter of a game against Northbridge on Sept. 18. He didn’t tell anyone about the injury however until three days later when he went to UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester to get his hand checked out.

As it turned out Mateo had broken a bone in his left hand.

“They recommended that I not play football but it’s at my own risk and I can do what I want” Mateo said. “I looked at my mom at the doctor’s office when they told me that and she said ‘I already know what your answer is.’”

Mateo’s response: he would continue to play.

So he had a cast put on his left wrist and returned to his team for their 21-7 win over Worcester Tech on Oct. 1.

“Luckily I didn’t need to have surgery and I’m just doing what I can for my team” Mateo said.

With a heavily wrapped left hand Mateo had to switch from starting at quarterback to starting at running back. The position change proved to be a natural progression.

“It was nothing new to me” said Mateo who also plays cornerback. “Once Coach said that (I’d switch positions) it kind of brightened up everything and allowed me to be myself.”

“He was willing to do whatever he needed to get back on the field” Landini said. “He pretty much told me he was playing again and I’m not going to say no.”

During that game against Northbridge Howe kept cramping up. The muscle spasms were so bad that he went to Milford Regional Medical Center afterward. A week later in a loss to West Boylston Howe continued to cramp up.

“I went to the doctors. I was just really tired” Howe said. “It turned out I came down with mono.”

Mononucleosis. An infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus according to WebMD with common symptoms including fatigue fever and sore throat.

“We had no idea” Landini said.

Howe lost roughly 10 pounds and missed two games against Worcester Tech and Monty Tech.

“But I’m back now” Howe said.

Just in time for a playoff push.

A dynamic trio

Furno is an offensive and defensive lineman. Although the Beavers have a few packages where he gets an opportunity to touch the ball on offense the hulking lineman usually doesn’t handle the pigskin.

So maybe that’s the reason why Furno’s favorite highlight from this season is a pass he intercepted and ran back 36 yards for a score in his team’s latest win over Bay Path.

“That kid is a menace” Mateo said.

“I’ve never had a pick-six before” Furno said.

Howe’s best moment this fall came on a 90-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the game against West Boylston.

“His speed athleticism and toughness make him a brutal force running the ball and makes it almost impossible for him to be tackled” Furno said.

Through five games played Mateo has rushed 57 times for 486 yards and 7 TDs. The senior captain also added two receiving scores.

“He’s fun to watch” Howe said.

Howe who suits up at running back and linebacker has only played in four games. Still the senior captain has racked up 341 yards and 8 touchdowns on 40 carries.

“Trey is an animal on both sides of the ball” Furno said.

As for Furno he doesn’t have any noteworthy offensive stats yet. But in six games on defense the senior captain has compiled 38 tackles 4 sacks and the one interception return for a touchdown.

Overall the trio has combined to score 18 of BVT’s 22 total touchdowns. They’ve proved to be a dangerous three-headed monster for the Beavers.

“They’re dynamic” Landini said. “They’re the reason why we’re so competitive.”

“Us three are the most versatile group of kids in (Central Mass.)” Furno said. “We all have our specialties and when brought together with our team – it makes (for) greatness.”

And with the playoffs fast approaching Blackstone Valley Tech is happy to have all three back on the football field. Together.

“We are going to be a threat for sure” Howe said.

What do you hope to achieve through THI?

● What I admire about THI is that in addition to direct aid it also seeks to stimulate the economy and create jobs by supporting entrepreneurs and companies to fortify the Greek economy from within. That is the key to seeing Greece prosper – encouraging and driving organic businesses with the right guidance. With THI I hope to continue to promote that effort.

Favorite activity to take part in where you live?

How has your Hellenic background helped shape who you are today?

● Growing up Greek instilled not only a lifelong set of values within me but also an appreciation and pride for my roots and the culture I have inherited. These values have helped guide me in the choices I make and the future I want to build for myself.

Life Motto?

● Success isn’t owned. It’s leased and rent is due every day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTAvZ3JhYi1zaW5nYXBvcmUtc3RyYXRlZ3ktaGlyaW5nLXNwYWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grab ramps up Singapore strategy hiring ahead of SPAC,"Grab isn’t just recruiting senior technologists from banks in Singapore; it’s latest finance-sector hire is in a senior strategy role. And it’s got plenty more strategy jobs in the pipeline.

Kaushik Viswanadha joined the tech giant CEO’s office earlier this month in a regional business operations job.

Viswanadha comes from Standard Chartered which bases many of its top strategy people in Singapore and is therefore an obvious headhunting ground.

He was with Stan Chart for about three and a half years latterly as a director of global strategy. His remit included digital transformation new business ventures and digital assets.

Viswanadha has joined Grab during a hiring spree for Singapore-based strategy jobs. Grab needs more strategists and consultants on board to help it transform into a “super app” and prepare for its Nasdaq-listed SPAC a deal which is expected to take place by year-end and which values the company at more than US$40bn

Grab has 39 Singapore-based vacancies in its business development and strategy category. These span a broad range of its business – from digital banking to grocery deliveries. There are senior roles on offer including a head of merchant strategy and execution.

The poaching from banks – Stan Chart Citi DBS OCBC and UOB are the likely targets Grab is likely to poach people from the Big Four and from consultancies such as McKinsey and Bain. Viswanadha started his career with a five-year stint at the former firm.

Suarez 44 gained name recognition for launching an effort to lure technology investors to the city at the beginning of the year meeting with PayPal founder Peter Thiel tech magnate Marcelo Claure and engaging on Twitter with Tesla CEO Elon Musk among other well-known entrepreneurs.

Analysts say Suarez was astute to seize a moment when some investors were looking to move to South Florida for tax reasons and looser COVID-19 restrictions during the pandemic. The mayor has been more than willing to assist. In December when someone tweeted about moving Silicon Valley to Miami Suarez replied “How can I help?”

The effect his tech push has had on migration and job creation is still unclear as census numbers do not yet include data for 2021.

But private equity firm Blackstone announced last fall that it would create a new office in downtown Miami to expand tech capabilities. Japan’s Softbank Group — an early investor in Alibaba — is also looking to grow its presence in the city and has invested $250 million in Miami startups. And venture capital firm Founders Fund has already set up shop in the trendy neighborhood of Wynwood.

Miami hosted a Bitcoin conference earlier this year and started accepting funds generated through a cryptocurrency named MiamiCoin. Its contributions so far total about $17 million but the money has not been spent.

Former Twitter Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain on Wednesday tweeted that he traveled to Miami for a meeting and to check out the “startup scene.”

“What I thought was hype is actually real” he wrote. “People in Miami exude an overwhelming sense of optimism right now. It’s electric! Optimism is a foundation of real technological progress.”

The Miami mayoral race is nonpartisan but if Suarez’s ambitions materialize he could soon transition to partisan contests.

Although he’s registered as a Republican he was critical of former President Donald Trump and pushed back against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ COVID-19 actions including the governor’s decision to prevent local communities from instituting mask mandates. Suarez has said he hopes the party picks more people “that unify us not divide us.”

Suarez is also not ruling out White House aspirations. He says the pandemic and social media elevated the roles and profile of “national mayors” making them stronger contenders for the presidency. Next year Suarez will become president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors giving him a bigger platform.

In April Suarez met with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley who called him a “rock star mayor” in one of the episodes of his YouTube vlog series “Cafecito Talks.” Haley served as U.N. ambassador under Trump and has contemplated running for president creating speculation Suarez could be part of her ticket.

“He is viewed as different with all the talk about business tech and Bitcoin” said Dario Moreno a political science professor at Florida International University. “It makes it attractive to young people.”

Suarez is a real estate attorney and son of Miami’s first Cuban-born mayor. When he launched his first mayoral bid back in 2013 he said he wanted to improve the reputation of the Miami government which has long been mocked as dysfunctional.

But just like his predecessors the mayor has struggled to shake off that image. Earlier this year he tapped Houston’s police chief to lead the Miami police department and called him the “Tom Brady” and “Michael Jordan” of chiefs. Chief Art Acevedo’s tenure was short after he was fired due to clashes with politicians and the police union that aired publicly in long commission meetings.

“Sometimes things don’t work out” Suarez said of the firing. “Part of leadership is also accepting that and turning the page.”

Back in 2017 when the previous mayor left office due to term limits Suarez won with 86% of the votes. He is hoping for a similar outcome this time.

This year he has four challengers who have not held office. They include Max Martínez who ran a digital marketing company; Marie Exantus who has worked in marketing and at a call center and Frank Pichel a former police officer turned private investigator who was arrested Oct. 1 on charges he impersonated law enforcement.

A fourth candidate had only raised $150 and another challenger was disqualified for living outside the city limits.

Suarez and his political action committee have raised more than $5 million compared to $28000 raised by his contenders combined.

The mayor says they will probably end with $5 million unspent that he can use for the future.

“We’ll see where it goes” he said.

One of the most ambitious was this promo produced for Pan Am’s Clipper service with the then-new Boeing 377 Stratocruiser. We clipped it from the Classic Airliners channel. As it would do later with the 747 Pan Am was instrumental in the development of the 377 and Boeing was well positioned to do it.

Boeing leveraged its developmental investment in the wartime B-29 and C-97 variant to create the Stratocruiser. To the modern eye its unique dual-hull design gives the airplane a whalish look especially compared to one of its contemporaries the sleek Lockheed L-649 Constellation. Among many eyebrow raisers in the film is the price: $1.5 million. Is that right? Yes it is. Even adjusted for inflation that would be only $15 million today just a bit more than a Citation XLS. Comparing it to say the modern Boeing 777 at $300 million shows how much aircraft prices have escalated even as ticket prices have plunged. For their day the two airplanes had similar globe-spanning aspirations.

For all the glory in the film the Stratocruiser’s impact was short lived. Only 55 were built for the airlines and Pan Am bought 20. By comparison 856 Constellations were built 704 DC-6s and another 338 DC-7s. Given the small passenger volume of the days those were pretty big numbers nonetheless and they drove the post-war expansion of airline travel. Pan Am’s eye was on oceanic crossings and the 377s plied the California-to-Hawaii trade plus destinations in Asia. This was a smaller market than domestic U.S. travel and flights to Europe challenging the steamship business. Oceanic tickets on the 377 were expensive; more than $4000 in today’s dollars. That explains why a cabin with 30 passengers wasn’t unusual.

The Stratocruiser’s accident record was bluntly abysmal. Fully 20 percent of the fleet were involved in civil-operation crashes and that doesn’t count the two that were lost by Aero Spacelines which had converted 337s for use as oversized Super Guppy freighters. As were other piston airliners of the day the Stratocruiser was a serial ditcher the most celebrated of which was piloted by Pan Am Captain Richard Ogg on Oct. 16 1956. The Pan Am Stratocruiser was nearing the midpoint of the 2100-mile flight between Hawaii and San Francisco when it lost first one engine then a second. In those days just for the purpose of salvation the Coast Guard maintained a cutter halfway between the U.S. and Hawaii called Ocean Station November. All 31 persons aboard the ditched 377 survived and the cutter USCGC Pontchartrain fished them out of the Pacific. This video tells the story and it’s fascinating.

The last operational 377 still in use is a turbine-powered variant owned by NASA as a large-component transport aircraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zNy1haXJsaW5lcy1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbus Antonov Boeing and Tupolev: The History Of S7 Airlines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zNy1haXJsaW5lcy1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3MvYm9laW5nLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWZpcnN0LWtjLTQ2YS0wMTM2MDc5MDguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing delivers first KC-46A refueling tanker to Japan,"FILE PHOTO: A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus sits on the tarmac at Boeing facilities at Boeing Field in this aerial photo in Seattle

By Nicholas P. Brown

(Reuters) - Boeing Co delivered its first KC-46A aircraft to Japan the company said on Sunday the first delivery of the aerial refueling jet to a customer outside the United States as growing tensions with China spur Japan to ramp up defense spending.

The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) took delivery of the jet under a contract first signed in 2017. Boeing in a statement called the delivery a ""significant milestone"" for U.S.-Japan cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.

The U.S. Air Force and JASDF initially awarded a contract for one KC-46A but have since exercised options for three more of the jets. Boeing touts the aircraft as its most state-of-the-art refueling tanker equipped with advanced sensors and capable of carrying cargo and passengers as it refuels other planes.

Still the KC-46 line used by the U.S. Air Force has run into performance snags including defects with an on-board video system.

Sunday's delivery comes at a tense time for Japan as it looks to counter China's military assertiveness in Asia.

The country's ruling party - which defied expectations by maintaining a majority in Sunday's parliamentary election - has pledged to double defense spending as public sentiment grows increasingly wary of China.

Japan's military strategy is focused on defending territory along the edge of the East China Sea where it is locked in a dispute with the Chinese government over a group of uninhabited islands.

One of China’s many troubled mega property developers China Oceanwide Holdings based in Beijing is swaggering toward dismemberment. And its tentacles reach into the US with a not-yet started condo tower at Manhattan’s South Street Seaport; the huge three-tower Oceanwide Plaza in Los Angeles where construction was halted in 2019 amid a tangle of lawsuits and unpaid contractors; and the huge two-tower Oceanwide Center in San Francisco the biggest ulcer in the center of the City five years after groundbreaking.

In terms of the San Francisco project construction was halted on the 54-floor tower in 2019 when it reached grade amid doubts about its commercial viability. In 2020 construction was halted on the 61-floor tower when it reached grade. The company had run out of money. By early 2021 nearly all the construction equipment was removed.

The whole project with an original budget of $1.6 billion was supposed to contain a Waldorf-Astoria condos and tons of office space – when over a quarter of San Francisco’s office space is now available for lease. The project is tangled up in numerous lawsuits and mechanics liens filed by unpaid contractors. The general contractor withdrew from the project (photo by Wolf Richter May 24 2021):

Oceanwide has tried to sell the San Francisco project multiple times and even found potentially interested buyers – including Boston Properties which owns the nearby Salesforce Tower; SPF Capital International an affiliate of Beijing-based SPF Group; and Hony Capital a Beijing-based PE firm. But those deals went nowhere.

So this got a lot more complicated. Two offshore entities of China’s Oceanwide Holdings – Oceanwide Holdings International Co. and Oceanwide Holdings International Financial Development Co. – had issued two notes totaling 2.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($321 million) to two different firms:

HK$1.4 billion to a Singapore entity of Haitong International Financial Services in 2019

HK$1.1 billion in notes to Spring Progress Investment Solutions in 2018.

Both notes were backed by collateral consisting of the entities’ shares in China Oceanwide Holdings and shares in the San Francisco Project.

When the notes matured the entities failed to pay them off. The two creditors have now taken over the collateral including the San Francisco Oceanwide Center according to a Shenzhen Stock Exchange filing on Thursday by China Oceanwide Holdings reported by Reuters.

It remains to be seen what the foundation of a huge project that may be commercially unviable is worth. And it remains to be seen what other claims are against it on top of the $150 million in mechanics liens. And sorting this out can get very complicated.

“The company is currently actively discussing with the above-mentioned two holders of notes to seek solutions” China Oceanwide Holdings said in the filing. It would be assessing the impact of the collateral takeover on its operations and finances it said.

The San Francisco project has had a tumultuous past. The land was acquired in a bankruptcy auction in 2013 by TMG Partners and Northwood Investors for $122 million. They hired architects and produced a design for the project. In 2015 they sold the land and the plans to Oceanwide for $296 million. Construction began in 2016.

At around that time China tightened capital outflows with a series of measures. In 2019 China imposed new capital controls that targeted investments by Chinese entities in foreign real estate projects – and the Oceanwide projects which were already out of money couldn’t get further funding.

At the time China was also cracking down on its highly-indebted conglomerates such as HNA which in early 2021 entered bankruptcy in China and Anbang which was taken over by the Chinese state.

In August 2020 the government imposed some limits on corporate borrowing – the “three red lines” — which were aimed at overleveraged property developers to force them to deleverage so that the property market wouldn’t blow up the financial system.

A slew of property developers are now in deep trouble including the biggie Evergrande. And authorities appear to be eager to keep them from imploding messily and instead are dealing with them as they have dealt with the conglomerates: a more or less orderly dismemberment.

China Oceanwide Holdings has been struggling to stay afloat. It sold some assets to raise funds. It did some housecleaning and its CEO chairman and some executives were forced out in July.

Whatever happens with Oceanwide in China these complications will further bog down the five-year-old cement-and-steel-filled pit in the ground in the center of San Francisco.

Mary Anne Shatford’s brother and mother appear in her dreams most frequently at this time of year. Bobby lost at sea 30 years ago this week during the Perfect Storm aboard the Gloucester swordfishing boat Andrea Gail and Ethel who died nine years and two days later of cancer and a broken heart infiltrate Shatford’s subconscious around Halloween.

“This is the time of year it could happen” she said surveying Harbor Cove from a second-floor waterfront bar on Gloucester’s Rogers Street. “The only thing about not seeing Bobby dead is you can talk yourself into the idea that he might be OK. I’ve had dreams where he’s living on an island someplace. He looks the same as the day he left.”

The multi-system storm that killed Shatford his five crewmates and seven others from Newfoundland to Puerto Rico ranks as one of the most severe Atlantic Basin ocean storms in recorded history. Sustained winds of 60 miles an hour blanketed the Atlantic south of Nova Scotia for almost 24 hours. Peak wave height the average of the highest third of waves held at 60 feet for more than a day across hundreds of square miles. The five-day weather event peaked over the Massachusetts coastline on Oct. 30 and 31.

“Two months earlier Hurricane Bob blew up here — a Category 2” recalls Bruce Tobey Gloucester’s mayor at the time. “What we saw that October met and surpassed it. I mean it was a frightening demonstration of the ocean’s power. The enormity of the Perfect Storm is drilled into my DNA. It haunts you. It haunts me still.”

When Tobey toured the destruction across his city a journey he made with then-Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci the men needed to ride in a National Guard half-track vehicle. They were looking at the aftermath of a once-in-a-century event. That is no longer the case.

Hurricane intensity is up

In the 1980s the National Climatic Data Center cataloged 12 weather and climate-related disasters across the U.S. in which overall damage costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. Since the Perfect Storm the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information have tracked 270 such events including a record 22 in 2020 (18 so far this year).

In August a report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that extreme sea-level events which previously occurred once in 100 years like the Perfect Storm could happen every year by the end of this century.

“Whether it is the number of hurricanes the number of major hurricanes average intensities of hurricanes rates of rapid-intensification how often rapid intensification occurs all these things are going up in the Atlantic Basin” said Tom Knutson a senior scientist and climate modeler for the NOAA.

Given the accelerating effects of climate on extreme weather activity flooding and ecosystem alteration the convergence of three weather systems over New England in the fall of ’91 is now a notable inflection point. Although scientific consensus remains elusive with regard to causation and long-term variability of Atlantic Ocean storms the world’s foremost experts agree that all climate events are now occurring in the context of a changing climate.

“In the scientific community the bar is really high for us to say any single aspect of the world is definitively changing and why” said Andrew Pershing Ph.D. director of climate science for Climate Central and formerly the chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI). “I think we need to flip that perspective around and say: The world is changing and the bar should be really high for us to say that something is going to stay the same.”

Coastal community vulnerability

There is broad agreement on four real-time trends. Atlantic hurricane intensity has increased since 1990. Storm-related precipitation is up. Water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine off the coast of Massachusetts are warming faster than 99% of the world’s oceans. Sea-level rise is projected to surge approximately nine inches by 2050 and accelerate thereafter.

Most coastal municipalities in Massachusetts are highly vulnerable but the home of America’s oldest fishing port is particularly susceptible. Gloucester features a large number of historic structures older housing and infrastructure low-lying road systems a significant percentage of underrepresented communities and a wastewater treatment plant that sits below sea level on marshland while also serving Essex and Rockport.

“Our sea walls are being breached monthly on the astronomical high tide” said Mike Hale director of Gloucester’s Department of Public Works. “Today’s low water line is at our old high tide line. What happens in a storm surge? We need to be as proactive as possible as soon as possible to mitigate that.”

Hurricane season in 2020 was the most active in history with a record 30 named storms including 14 hurricanes seven of which were Category 3 or above. Two such storms a Category 4 and Category 5 formed last November and a record 11 of the 30 made landfall in the U.S. Late fall carries the risk of hybrid storms like the Perfect Storm and Superstorm Sandy which occur when a hurricane or a tropical cyclone below hurricane strength collides with a Nor’easter. The Perfect Storm also featured a Canadian cold front.

Hybrid systems can intensify rapidly. An October 2019 “bomb cyclone” that hit Maine was on weather maps for just 48 hours. To make matters worse atmospheric conditions like blocking patterns in the North Atlantic — the meteorological equivalent of a traffic jam — are expected to become more frequent according to David Reidmiller Climate Center director at GMRI.

“These are high-pressure systems that can exist off Southern Greenland and cause storms to stay in place longer” he said. “That allows them to strengthen as they stall over water. Our warmer waters and warmer atmosphere mean more water vapor in the air which can feed those storms. This potentially elevates their intensity in terms of rainfall duration and wind velocity and even the (square-mile) expanse of a storm.”

Since 2016 rain-induced flooding has overtaken storm surge as the leading cause of hurricane-related fatalities.

‘They were already dead’

Since 1984 Gregg Souza has owned the Crow’s Nest bar where Bobby Shatford spent the last night of his life on dry land in the upstairs accommodations. The place was the social hub of Gloucester’s fishing fleet back then. Today it draws as many tourists as regulars. Mary Anne Shatford now Souza’s wife estimates that an out-of-towner bellies up to ask about the storm Ethel or the crew of the Andrea Gail on nine days out of 10 (the Nest is open 365).

Souza vividly recalls hiking a back route with Mary Anne as the storm ramped up so the couple could overlook the city’s deserted Atlantic Road which runs parallel to the open ocean. He thinks it was Oct. 29. Waves cresting at 25 feet pounded the headlands. Street asphalt was jettisoned and replaced by boulders from rock outcroppings. Two days later the scene was unrecognizable. A concrete seawall abutting the road had vanished and an Atlantic Road fire hydrant left sitting atop 25 feet of naked standpipe resembled a miniature lighthouse.

“As we watched the water roll over the road I remember Mary Anne asked me ‘Do you think Bobby and the guys are OK?’” said Souza. “I said ‘Oh yeah. They’re 500 miles east of here at least. It’s probably sunny and nice where they are.’ Turns out I was probably right about the weather out there except that they were already dead. They’d seen the worst of the storm that we were about to.”

The commonly held theory about the fate of the Andrea Gail is that the 72-foot steel-hulled vessel encountered a nonnegotiable wave — a “queer sea” in fisherman parlance — with an angled face of 70 to 100 feet. Meteorologists call them “rogues.”

“It’s pretty likely they were facing maximum highest seas of 80 to 90 feet on the northeast side of the storm” said Joe Dellicarpini a meteorologist and science operations officer at NOAA’s National Weather Service Boston/Norton. “A buoy off Sable Island — 100 miles offshore and about 200 miles southeast of Halifax Nova Scotia — registered a 100-foot wave on the 29th.”

Last known radio contact with captain Billy Tyne just after 6 p.m. on the 28th indicated he was trying to run with the sea and away from Gloucester about 180 miles northeast of Sable Island as the storm was hammering those same latitudes south of Nova Scotia. Linda Greenlaw captain of a sister boat the Hannah Boden spoke to Tyne at 5 p.m. almost certainly between six and 10 hours before his boat and crew went to the bottom.

“What I know is that Billy Tyne was doing everything within his power to keep the boat and his crew safe” said Greenlaw now an author and lobster boat captain in Maine who rode out the storm north of the Flemish Cap around 600 miles east of Tyne’s position. “He was a very capable guy. Whatever happened occurred very quickly because there was no mayday call no life raft deployed. I’m sure he was doing everything right but you can do everything right at sea and still have things go wrong.”

The three likeliest possibilities in the forensics of the sinking suggest that the Andrea Gail was either pitch-poled bow over stern running into the storm rolled by a massive boarding wave in a beam sea or riding in a following sea got slammed into the trough of a wave and plowed under. By the morning of the 29th NOAA reported 63-foot waves off Cape Cod and three dozen boats aground or sunk on Nauset Beach 600 nautical miles west of Tyne’s last known position.

The crew the storm and the sinking are recounted in the 1997 non-fiction book “The Perfect Storm” by Sebastian Junger a story that was adapted for a movie by the same name in 2000.

Good news bad news

Though bluewater vessels may contend more frequently with the blitzkrieg pace of hybrid storms today it is less likely we’ll see an Andrea Gail situation again given technological advances and the fact quotas gear regulations and time-limited fishing seasons mean fewer vessels and less exposure.

The threat of extreme-storm impacts on people and property now seems more concentrated on coastal and inland areas. Large tidal swings base sea-level rise intense and enduring precipitation and hybrid storm intensity are life- and livelihood-threatening realities for Gloucester and communities across New England.

A large-scale event is still a matter of timing but it’s also just a matter of time.

“The optimistic side of the message is important” said Massachusetts-based Ellen Mecray NOAA/NCEI’s Regional Climate Services Director for the Eastern Region. “States in this region have been more proactive than most in the U.S.”

“Humans always have two options in the face of daunting obstacles” Mecray said. “One path leads to depression and inaction and the other is something we’re really good at as New Englanders. We pick ourselves up and move forward with action. I think most residents now see that what we’ve been saying would happen is happening and it’s time to act.”

The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on Nov. 30.

Overall outcomes are dismal in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Alvocidib is a multi-cyclin-dependent kinase (multi-CDK) inhibitor with potent activity against CDK9. CDK9 forms a complex with cyclin T1 positive transcription elongation factor b which exists in a superenhancer complex to regulate the activity of RNA-polymerase II. By inhibiting CDK9 alvocidib leads to the suppression of RNA-polymerase II-mediated transcription of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) a pro-survival BCL-2 family member that inhibits the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and promotes leukemia survival [1]. MCL-1 has a short half-life and is dependent on continuous transcription from RNA-polymerase II for activity [2]. There is a strong rationale to investigate targeted strategies of MCL-1 inhibition in diverse AML treatment settings.

Alvocidib followed by cytarabine and mitoxantrone (ACM) has been investigated in a timed-sequential therapy approach with the purpose of priming leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis during opportune time periods of leukemia cell-cycle progression with cell-cycle-specific anti-leukemia agents. Serial studies in both newly diagnosed (n = 256) and R/R AML (n = 149) revealed encouraging findings with ACM though notably some of these studies included patients aged >65 years and did not prospectively assess for MCL-1 dependence [3]. We hypothesized that leukemia dependence of MCL-1 may predict for response to ACM. We conducted a two-stage clinical trial of ACM in MCL-1-dependent R/R AML. Stage 1 was a biomarker-based prospective analysis of ACM activity based on MCL-1 dependence in R/R AML and newly diagnosed AML. Stage 2 was a randomized phase 2 trial of ACM vs. cytarabine and mitoxantrone in MCL-1-dependent R/R AML to assess whether alvocidib improves composite complete remission (CRc) rates in R/R AML. However slow accrual and drug availability led to the early termination of the study. Herein we focus on the results of the completed MCL-1-dependent biomarker analysis of ACM in R/R AML.

Zella-201 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02520011) enrolled adults 18–65 years with pathologically confirmed AML in first relapse (CR duration <24 months) or with refractory AML after 1–2 cycles of intensive induction therapy. MCL-1 dependence was assessed using the pro-apoptotic BH3-sensitizing NOXA-mimetic peptide T-MS1 as previously described [4] and initially defined as ≥40% (further details in Supplemental Appendix). In addition an exploratory cohort of newly diagnosed high-risk (NDHR) AML enrolled patients with MCL-1 dependence (≥40%) (see Supplemental Appendix). Treatment plan is outlined in Fig. 1A–B. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of R/R AML patients with MCL-1 dependence ≥40% achieving CRc (CR/CR with incomplete recovery (CRi)) after cycle 1 of therapy with ACM (see Supplemental Appendix). Full eligibility criteria are outlined in Supplemental Appendix. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki after approval by ethics committee of each participating center. Fig. 1: Study diagram consort diagram and response rate.

Between January 2016 and December 2019 451 patients (R/R AML: n = 221; NDHR AML: n = 169) were screened for MCL-1 dependence (consort diagram Fig. 1A). The overall proportion of AML patients initially determined to be MCL-1 dependent (≥40%) was 39% (R/R AML: 84/221 = 38% NDHR AML: 67/169 = 40%). The threshold to define MCL-1 dependence was later amended to ≥30% and the overall proportion of R/R AML patients with MCL-1 dependence ≥30% was 47% (104/221). Eighty-two patients were enrolled onto one of the five cohorts: (1) MCL-1 <15% (n = 15) (2) MCL-1: 15–<30% (n = 14) (3) MCL-1: 30–<40% (n = 14) (4) MCL-1: ≥40% (n = 25) and (5) NDHR AML with MCL-1 ≥40% (n = 14). Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Among all R/R AML patients (n = 68) the CR CRi and CRc rates were 28 19 and 47% respectively (Fig. 1C). Three patients were not evaluable for response (Fig. 1A). A comparison of all patients (intent-to-treat) and response-evaluable patients in each cohort is shown in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2. Among all patients the CRc rate was 47% (7/15) 21% (3/14) 64% (9/14) and 52% (13/25) in R/R AML patients with MCL-1 <15% 15–<30% 30–<40% and ≥40% respectively. Given the similar clinical activity of ACM in MCL-1 ≥30% and ≥40% the definition of MCL-1 dependence was subsequently amended to MCL-1 ≥30%. CRc rate was 56% in patients with R/R AML with MCL-1 ≥30% vs. 34% in R/R AML with MCL-1 <30% (P = 0.08). Notably refractory AML patients with MCL-1 dependence had a CRc rate of 52% compared with 38% in refractory AML patients without MCL-1 dependence (Supplemental Fig. 1). In the NDHR AML cohort (n = 14) the CR CRi and CRc rates among all patients were 43 14 and 57% respectively. Table 1 Stage 1 patient characteristics. Full size table

For all R/R AML cohorts median follow-up overall survival (OS) event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) was 7.2 months 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.9 16.9 months] 2.5 months [95% CI: 1.6 3.9 months] and 11.8 months [95% CI: 6.0 17.5 months] respectively (Supplemental Fig. 2). One- and 2-year OS was 48 and 24% respectively. A comparison of clinical outcomes among patients with MCL-1-dependent R/R AML and non-MCL-1-dependent R/R AML patients is outlined in Supplemental Tables 3–5. Median OS was 11.2 vs. 7.4 months in those with R/R MCL-1 dependence vs. R/R AML without MCL-1 dependence respectively (P = 0.40).

Treatment-emergent grade ≥3 non-hematologic adverse events after alvocidib are illustrated in Supplemental Table 5. Overall 30-day mortality was 6% in R/R AML and 0% in NDHR AML. In those who achieved CRc median time to full neutrophil (absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 × 109/L) recovery for R/R was 48 [48 71] days compared with 45 [40 NA] days in the NDHR AML cohort.

A gene matrix of baseline mutations and genomic classification stratified based on response and treatment setting to ACM is shown in Supplemental Fig. 3 (R/R: n = 67; NDHR: 13). In order to assess whether MCL-1 dependence may enrich for overall response to ACM bootstrap resampling analysis was performed in order to infer population variance of MCL-1 priming results (Supplemental Appendix) [5]. There was a significantly higher frequency of overall response observed in the MCL-1-dependent cohort (MCL-1 ≥30%) compared with non-responders (P < 0.001) whereas overall response was less frequently observed in the MCL-1 <30% cohort compared with non-responders (Supplemental Fig. 4).

This is the first clinical trial prospectively assessing MCL-1 dependence as a biomarker for AML. We have shown that 47% of R/R AML patients are MCL-1 dependent (≥30%) and may be candidates for MCL-1-directed therapies [3]. This study met the primary endpoint with a CRc rate of 57% in MCL-1-dependent (≥40%) R/R AML. In order to broaden the putative patient population who may benefit from ACM the criteria for MCL-1 dependence was amended to ≥30%. Overall CRc rates were non-significantly higher in patients with MCL-1 ≥30% vs. MCL-1 <30% (56 vs. 34%; P = 0.08). However the study design was not powered to compare CRc rates between MCL-1-dependent cohorts and small numbers of patients likely precluded statistical significance. Salutary clinical activity was also evident in a high-risk MCL-1-dependent newly diagnosed AML exploratory cohort (CRc = 62%) which appear to be similar to ACM in unselected newly diagnosed poor-risk AML patients [3 6].

Despite recent treatment advances in R/R AML there remains no standard-of-care salvage regimen and R/R AML continues to be the highest unmet need in AML. We divided R/R AML patients into 3 distinct subgroups: refractory (induction failure or CR1 duration <3 months) early relapse (CR1 duration 3–12 months) and late relapse (CR1 duration 12–24 months). The majority of R/R AML patients had either refractory or early relapse (84%) compared with late relapse (16%) corroborating the poor-risk group of patients enrolling on this study. In fact median OS was 16.9 months in patients with refractory MCL-1-dependent AML which compares favorably to outcomes seen with conventional chemotherapy agents in refractory AML.

Previous studies have demonstrated clinical activity of ACM in R/R AML. A randomized phase 2 study performed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) investigated three treatment regimens for R/R AML: ACM sirolimus plus mitoxantrone etoposide cytarabine and carboplatin plus topotecan. Of the three regimens studied ACM was the only regimen to meet the primary endpoint of the study with a CR rate of 28% [7]. A composite of 113 R/R AML patients treated with ACM across 3 single-arm phase 1 and 2 trials revealed an overall CRc rate of 38% with unsurprisingly lower responses in refractory compared with relapsed AML (CRc rates 14 vs. 72% respectively) [3]. Importantly these studies did not differentiate MCL-1 dependence among those treated with ACM. In MCL-1-dependent patients with R/R AML on the current study overall CRc rates were 52 and 55% in refractory and early relapse AML respectively substantiating clinical activity in these poor-risk patient subgroups and comparing favorably to historical controls.

MCL-1 is an anti-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family that inhibits BAX/BAK-mediated mitochondrial permeabilization and cell death. MCL-1 is upregulated in AML patients particularly during relapse and is a major contributor to AML progression [8 9]. Leukemia cells utilize variable levels of BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins to undergo cellular proliferation and mitigate cell death through the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. BH3 profiling assesses the relative cellular dependence of BCL-2 and/or MCL-1 for survival [10 11] and represents a promising strategy to discriminate therapeutic response to BCL-2 mimetics [12]. While it is not possible to assess whether higher MCL-1 scores was associated with response to ACM in the context of this study our findings suggest that alvocidib may have preferential clinical activity in MCL-1-dependent AML. Venetoclax has been investigated in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents with encouraging clinical activity in newly diagnosed and R/R AML [13 14] suggesting that combining agents targeting apoptotic pathways with cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Our findings provide the foundation for further biomarker-driven strategies for BCL-2 mimetics in R/R AML.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1cmV0b2RheS5jb20vdmlldy9oZXJvaWNhbGx5LWNvbW1pdHRlZC10by1wYXRpZW50cy13aXRoLWx1bmctY2FuY2VyLWFuZC1tZXNvdGhlbGlvbWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heroically Committed to Patients With Lung Cancer and Mesothelioma,"It is my great pleasure to nominate Dr. Kenneth Rosenzweig as a lung cancer hero for 2021. I have known about Dr. Rosenzweig’s significant contributions to the field of lung cancer for many years in my role as CEO of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and I have only been more appreciative of his achievements as his colleague at Mount Sinai for the past three years.

Dr. Rosenzweig’s curriculum vitae speaks for itself. He graduated with honors from Brown University. He subsequently attended Yale School of Medicine where he was a member of the prestigious Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. He did his training in radiation oncology at Harvard Medical School and then began his career at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).

At MSKCC and later at Mount Sinai Dr. Rosenzweig performed extraordinary research in the field of lung cancer and mesothelioma. He has published more than 150 scientific manuscripts and authored numerous book chapters and guidelines. I would classify his contributions to the field in four distinct categories: research education patient care and community service.

Research: Dr. Rosenzweig’s work has established the standard of care for radiation therapy technique in both locally advanced lung cancer and mesothelioma. His National Institutes of Health-funded phase 1 protocol was the first to demonstrate the method to safely escalate dose in patients with stage 3 lung cancer and how to account for tumor motion and incorporate metabolic imaging such as positron emission tomography scans into the treatment paradigm. His technique is the template for how every patient in the world is currently treated with radiation therapy. His work established safety guidelines for the treatment of early-stage lung cancer with stereotactic body radiation therapy. He also pioneered the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy for mesothelioma. Both this project and his lung cancer work resulted in landmark publications in the Journal of Clinical Oncology and formed the basis of multiple cooperative group trials including NRG-LU006.

Education: Dr. Rosenzweig has been equally committed to teaching other physicians how to treat lung cancer. His mentees lead lung cancer and mesothelioma programs at institutions across the United States including MSKCC The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center University of Washington University of Florida and elsewhere. As vice chair of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for Radiation Oncology and committee chair for the American Board of Radiology he has helped develop the standards that every practicing radiation oncologist needs to know in the treatment of lung cancer to ensure that all patients will receive the highest-quality care regardless of where they receive their treatment. He has also chaired numerous guidelines committees which codify the standard of care in the treatment of lung cancer. For more than a decade Dr. Rosenzweig participated as a volunteer in Chartrounds giving community physicians the opportunity to present challenging cases to him and receive advice on how to care for their patients.

Patient care: Throughout his years as a researcher educator and administrator Dr. Rosenzweig has also maintained a busy clinical practice devoted to people suffering from lung cancer and mesothelioma. He has been awarded the Cullman Family Award for Excellence in Physician Communication which is given to the top 1% of physicians. He is consistently on the New York magazine list of Top Doctors. As chair of the department of radiation oncology he has established a culture of the highest-quality patient care with innovative systems to reduce treatment error and improve the patient experience. His department is typically at the top of patient satisfaction surveys and frequently hosts visitors from other institutions looking to improve their processes. Most recently his department has established schools for radiation therapists and radiation dosimetrists ensuring that every aspect of patient care is the best it can be.

Community service: Dr. Rosenzweig has participated in numerous patient education seminars to inform patients on new treatments for lung cancer. He is a regular volunteer monthly panelist on CancerCare talks which draws hundreds of participants living with or helping family members with lung cancer. As mentioned previously he gives back to the oncology community through his numerous leadership roles on national committees including a term as president of the American Radium Society the country’s oldest organization devoted to the study of cancer.

I would mention in his life outside of the hospital Dr. Rosenzweig is no less inspiring. He was recently reelected to his third term as city councilman in his hometown of Englewood New Jersey and has been involved in numerous community organizations for more than 20 years. He also recently received the 2021 Community Service Award from the Rotary Club of Englewood. He also serves on multiple alumni committees for Brown University including some leadership roles. It is incredible that Dr. Rosenzweig can devote long days to his duties as a physician researcher educator and chair and then come home and spend a few more hours working to improve his community. And he also finds time to run the New York City Marathon every year.

In conclusion Dr. Rosenzweig’s commitment to helping patients with lung cancer and mesothelioma is truly heroic and I can think of no one more deserving of this award.

FDA approves Pfizer vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11

The Food and Drug Administration on Friday backed emergency-use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for U.S. children ages 5 to 11. The decision which was expected after FDA advisers endorsed the shots marked one of the final steps toward making the two-shot regimen available to the roughly 28 million American children in this age group. Public health experts have called the move a major milestone in the fight against the pandemic. ""Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy"" FDA acting commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement adding that a review of test data showed the vaccine is safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could give final approval at a Nov. 2 meeting.

2. G-20 leaders back global minimum tax

President Biden and other leaders of the Group of 20 major economies endorsed a global minimum corporate tax on Saturday at the start of a two-day summit in Rome. The landmark agreement seeks to prevent major companies such as Apple and Bristol Myers Squibb from moving profits and jobs across borders to avoid taxes. A deal has been in the works for years but Biden's Treasury Department made a sustained push to finalize it at the summit. G-20 leaders also hope to take a common stand on ways to honor the 2015 Paris climate agreement ahead of next week's United Nations climate conference COP26. On Friday senior G-20 leaders announced the creation of a global body to coordinate government responses to the next pandemic.

3. Frequent Trump critic Kinzinger says he won't seek re-election

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) one of the 10 House Democrats who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump over the Jan. 6 Capitol attack announced Friday that he would not run for re-election in 2022. Kinzinger along with Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) is one of two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the insurrection by a mob of Trump supporters. He said Congress was too bitterly divided to work together in a civil manner with ""little to no desire to bridge our differences."" Kinzinger's announcement followed the redrawing of his congressional district by the Democrat-led Illinois legislature. The new congressional map would have forced him into a race against fellow Republican Rep. Darin LaHood.

4. Biden calls submarine deal 'clumsy' makes peace with Macron

President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday held their first face-to-face meeting since a diplomatic clash over a U.S. deal to provide nuclear submarine technology to Australia. That deal resulted in the cancellation of an agreement for Australia to buy conventional subs from France angering Macron's government. Biden conceded that his administration had been ""clumsy"" in its handling of the announcement of the Australia deal. ""It was not done with a lot of grace"" Biden said adding that the U.S. should have informed France ""an extremely extremely valued partner"" ahead of time. Macron said he was satisfied that the close relationship between the two allies had been repaired.

USA Today

The Supreme Court on Friday declined to block Maine's coronavirus vaccine mandate for health care workers. The majority gave no reasons for the emergency ruling. The court's three most conservative justices — Clarence Thomas Samuel Alito Jr. and Neil Gorsuch — issued a dissent saying the fact that the state's policy includes no religious exemption meant that ""health care workers who have served on the front line of a pandemic for the last 18 months are now being fired and their practices shuttered. All for adhering to their constitutionally protected religious beliefs."" Two other conservatives Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh filed a brief concurring opinion siding with the majority and saying major decisions shouldn't be made ""on a short fuse without benefit of full briefing and oral argument.""

6. Biden administration launches 2nd attempt to end 'Remain in Mexico' policy

The Biden administration said Friday it was trying for a second time to end former President Donald Trump's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy for migrants seeking to cross the southern border into the United States to pursue asylum claims. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas conceded in a memo that the Trump-era policy probably reduced unauthorized migration but said it did so at ""substantial and unjustifiable human costs."" Mayorkas said the Biden administration can reduce migration more humanely with other policies including fast-tracked immigration hearings and a proposed rule change permitting asylum officers to decide on applications more quickly. The latest Biden administration move won't immediately change the court-mandated resumption of the Remain in Mexico policy.

7. Biden says Pope Francis called him a 'good Catholic'

President Biden said Friday after meeting with Pope Francis that the pontiff told him he was a ""good Catholic"" and should continue receiving Communion despite a push by conservative U.S. bishops to deny him the sacrament over his support for abortion rights. Biden has met with Francis four times but this was his first such visit as president. The two leaders talked at the Vatican about policy issues including climate change and the coronavirus pandemic as well as what Biden described as personal things. Biden gave Francis a coin with the insignia of the National Guard unit of his late son Beau Biden. Francis privately counseled Biden and his family after Beau Biden who had brain cancer died in 2015.

10. Oklahoma to continue lethal injections after inmate vomits during execution

Oklahoma's prison system director Scott Crow said Friday the state would not change its lethal injection protocols after the first person executed by Oklahoma since 2015 vomited and convulsed after receiving the first drug in the state's three-drug execution sequence. Reporters who have witnessed previous executions said it was extremely rare for a condemned inmate to vomit during an execution. But Crow said the doctor who monitored John Marion Grant's execution told him it was ""not a completely uncommon occurrence"" for a person to vomit when given a sedative like the first drug in Oklahoma's execution protocol. Before last week Oklahoma was under a capital punishment moratorium due to mistakes in previous executions.

Brown the highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history. We already knew a number of details from that incredible contract but thanks to Will Laws of Sports Illustrated we now know of a wild detail with unprecedented consequences.

Laws points out that Brown’s deal includes a void year at the end of the contract that will hold a $53.52MM cap hit. This is actually a common contract technique the Eagles have been employing in recent years that allow them a ton of flexibility financially. Several other players have massive voidable cap hits like Jalen Hurts ($97.55MM) DeVonta Smith ($35.78MM) and others.

This likely doesn’t mean that someday the Eagles will suddenly be committing a triple-digit cap figure to players no longer on their roster. That could only happen if they see every contract through to completion. More likely Philadelphia will be extremely strategic about how long to hold on to those players cutting them at times that will allow for ideal cap savings. For instance starting in 2027 the Eagles will be able to cut Brown and receive more in cap savings than they’ll be losing to dead money.

Here are a few other contract details on recent deals around the NFL:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2FkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLzQ2NTk0MTgtYmlkZW4tdG8tbWVldC13aXRoLWJyb3duLXYtYm9hcmQtcGxhaW50aWZmcy1kdXJpbmctd2Vlay1vZi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtYmxhY2stY29tbXVuaXR5L9IBkwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2FkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLzQ2NTk0MTgtYmlkZW4tdG8tbWVldC13aXRoLWJyb3duLXYtYm9hcmQtcGxhaW50aWZmcy1kdXJpbmctd2Vlay1vZi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtYmxhY2stY29tbXVuaXR5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden to meet with Brown v.

That infamous philosophy entered the world after Poirier repeatedly tried guillotine chokes against Benoit Saint Denis at UFC 299 against the advice of his coaches who could be heard in his corner telling him “no more guillotines” after the first round. Poirier has a nasty guillotine choke and he never hesitates to use it even if the move almost always ends with him in a bad position after his opponent slips free from the submission.

It turns out cameras actually missed the rest of the interaction between Poirier and his head coach Mike Brown at UFC 299 which is where he told the Louisiana native to stop looking for that same submission.

“They actually didn’t play it in between the rounds after the first round I said ‘No more guillotines’ and then they switched to the other corner” Brown told MMA Fighting. “But right after I said that Dustin said ‘No but I can hit it! I can hit it!’ I just replied ‘You crazy bastard.’

“I literally said that and then he went and jumped another one. They didn’t play that part but there was more words said after I said don’t jump the guillotine.”

Poirier ultimately beat Saint Denis by knockout but he’s been rather adamant that a failed guillotine attempt won’t stop him from going for the choke again in the future.

Despite never finishing a fight with a guillotine Brown knows Poirier is effective with the technique because he’s witnessed it in the gym hundreds of times over the years.

“He puts a lot of guys to sleep in the gym to be honest” Brown said. “He does have a very good one. He just hasn’t hit them in the fight.”

While his instructions to stop going for guillotine chokes got a lot of attention around the Saint Denis fight Brown admits that Poirier’s love of the submission actually got a bigger reaction out of him during a different matchup a couple of years ago.

“The fight where I was losing my mind is the fight with [Dan] Hooker” Brown said. “Because he had lost the first two rounds and then he was battling back and then he was jumping guillotine in those later rounds and had he got stuck on bottom in any one of those rounds he would have lost the third round and wouldn’t have won the decision.

“But somehow he wouldn’t hit the guillotine but he would somehow scramble to get back to his feet and start dropping bombs on him and doing damage and then somehow stealing the round anyway. He would somehow find a way to make it work. He made us sweat and bite our nails in that one that’s for sure.”

Poirier’s next chance to land a guillotine choke comes at UFC 302 on June 1 when he faces reigning lightweight champion Islam Makhachev in the main event.

Back in 2019 when he faced then-champion Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 242 Poirier famously went for his guillotine choke — and for a moment looked as if he might become the first person to hand the undefeated Russian a loss. It wasn’t meant to be however as Nurmagomedov escaped and used his top position to rain down punishment on Poirier before eventually securing a rear-naked choke submission of his own to finish the fight.

Now five years later Poirier faces Nurmagomedov’s protege Makhachev and Brown admits it would be rather poetic if a guillotine ends up winning him the UFC lightweight title.

“It absolutely could happen” Brown said. “He’s done so much in the sport. I almost feel like he doesn’t have anything more to prove but this is the one box he has to check. I feel like he’s a champion even though he hasn’t won a title a true UFC title. He’s won the interim. I feel like he’s a champion in my eyes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXRobGV0aWMuY29tLzU0ODY2NjUvMjAyNC8wNS8xMi9jdWJzLWJlbi1icm93bi1jb3JiaW4tYnVybmVzLWJyYW5kb24td29vZHJ1ZmYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cubs' Ben Brown aiming for rotation spot has studied Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff,"Even before the Chicago Cubs hired Craig Counsell Ben Brown had researched the career arcs of Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff. On Counsell’s watch the Milwaukee Brewers developed All-Star pitchers without drafting them at the top of the first round or fast-tracking them into the major-league rotation. Brown’s curiosity and studious approach to the game led him down this path.

“I had gone into a deep Corbin Burnes dive last year when I was struggling” Brown said. “This was right in the middle of it. This was me struggling in Triple A and then getting hurt. I can tell you about a lot of guys who had bounce-back years.”

Brown laughed and continued: “I did the same thing when I had Tommy John. I can probably rattle off every dude who had TJ in all of North America.”

Brown’s Tommy John surgery cost him most of the 2019 season but he popped up as a prospect in the summer of 2022 when the Philadelphia Phillies traded him for veteran reliever David Robertson. By this time last year Brown had already earned a promotion from Double-A Tennessee and submitted two lights-out starts for the Iowa Cubs. The phone call every player dreams about did not happen.

Opening Day rolled around this season and Brown was still waiting. And then Justin Steele dropped to the ground with a strained left hamstring in the fifth inning of Game 1 making Brown the next man up. Brown 24 struggled in his major-league debut before quickly settling into a hybrid role that took him off the roster bubble.

Brown’s value could be seen in Friday’s 7-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates as he replaced starter Javier Assad and threw 3 2/3 scoreless innings that featured six strikeouts against one walk. Managing Brown’s workload — he threw fewer than 100 innings last year — is a bigger issue than determining whether he belongs.

Brown’s future could be in the rotation — the 6-foot-6 210-pound right-hander certainly looks the part — and the Cubs will keep open that possibility. His heavy fastball/curveball combination has also led reporters to ask Counsell whether Brown could emerge as the team’s closer.

“Ben’s best asset right now is he throws really hard” Counsell said. “Without being too analytical it’s just the hitters’ reaction. He’s beating hitters with the fastball. That’s not easy to do in the big leagues. No matter what your velocity is it’s just not easy to do. He’s beating hitters with the fastball and that makes you cheat. And that makes his off-speed very good. That’s kind of his formula.”

Counsell’s formula for small-market success included more than just Burnes and Woodruff. They were never regarded as generational pitching prospects like Paul Skenes the No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft who debuted Saturday against the Cubs at PNC Park. Woodruff was optioned to Triple-A Colorado Springs seven times between July 2017 and July 2018 an example of the roster management that showed Counsell’s dexterity during Milwaukee’s rise.

“He has an excellent track record” Brown said mentioning Josh Hader Devin Williams and Freddy Peralta by name. “There are some really good arms that Craig really helped develop.”

As a rookie in 2018 Burnes went 7-0 with a 2.61 ERA in 30 appearances out of the bullpen a midseason boost that helped the Brewers force a Game 163 at Wrigley Field and take away a division title from the Cubs. Burnes split the next season between the majors (8.82 ERA) and Triple-A San Antonio (8.46 ERA). His name then appeared in the Cy Young Award voting in each of the next four years and he won the award in 2021.

Progress as Cubs executives like to say isn’t always linear. Brown spent a month-plus on the injured list with a strained left oblique and finished last season working out of Iowa’s bullpen. He needed those reminders when his development stalled.

“Corbin Burnes went through that one funky year before he ended (up) going off for a Cy Young ride” Brown said. “Woodruff was a little bit of a late bloomer as well. There’s the (Jacob) deGroms of the world who didn’t debut until he was (almost) 26. Last year with my frustration I was like ‘Hey there’s still hope for me to be a good baseball player one day.’”

Brown’s self-awareness and dedication to his craft should help him continue to make adjustments. He has a 2.84 ERA in four starts and four multi-inning appearances as a reliever. His fastball velocity (96.5 mph) is elite. His strikeout rate (25.8 percent) is above average on a staff that doesn’t have that much classic swing-and-miss stuff.

Brown’s personality traits will also likely keep him in Counsell’s circle of trust. It’s not like the Cubs are going to suddenly get healthy. Before Saturday’s game in Pittsburgh the team placed reliever Yency Almonte on the 15-day injured list with a strained right shoulder and recalled right-hander José Cuas from Iowa. Whatever Counsell needs Brown will be available.

“It’s all good” Brown said. “Put in the time. Put in the work. And try not to worry too much about going down or whatever. It’s been awesome.”

Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

The center says any pelican found acting strangely should be reported immediately to local animal control. For information about donating or volunteering visit the International Bird Rescue website."

Of course the core Internet streaming code would be useful with any ESP32 but the display makes for a good-looking unit. The code is available on GitHub. With judicious use of network and audio libraries the player only takes a few hundred lines of code. Pretty impressive considering it even shows a visualization on the tiny display screen.

What we’d really like to see is a nice case power supply and speaker option to make a tiny and portable unit. With a 3D printer it is easy to make very professional-looking projects as we often see. On the other hand it does look better than the breadboard version you can see towards the end of the video. It is though a neatly done breadboard.

A few days later all traces of the Northern Nevada gaming mainstay were gone the sign’s outline whitewashed by a fresh coat of paint.

It was a beginning in an end. The closure of Harrah’s after nearly 84 years in the Northern Nevada city also signifies the rebirth of downtown Reno as the city seeks to broaden its economy.

Harrah’s Reno shut its doors in March 2020 when the pandemic forced a 78-day shutdown of Nevada gaming industry. It never reopened. The property was sold two months earlier by Caesars Entertainment and VICI Properties for $50 million to Las Vegas-based CAI Investments a real estate development and management company.

CAI announced at the time it would convert the aging 980-room hotel-casino into Reno City Center a mixed-use development with 530 one- and two-bedroom residential units. Commercial office space restaurants and retail offerings would replace the casino.

In place of the Harrah’s sign there will be a building-height illustration of a downtown Reno map with the Truckee River and highlighting City Center’s location as the original casino in the Harrah’s chain opened by William F. “Bill” Harrah in 1937.

The development is expected to open early next year.

CAI Investments CEO Chris Beavor who grew up in Reno idealizes a downtown framed by the Truckee River that underscores Northern Nevada’s outdoor lifestyle. He said other residential developments would move from the planning stages to construction based on the success of Reno City Center.

“We look for a void in the marketplace and what Reno needs right now is people living and breathing in downtown” Beavor said. “That’s one way you activate the community.”

City leaders the business community and operators of Reno’s casinos believe transforming downtown from a gaming destination into a place with affordable living spaces vibrant restaurants stylish hotel rooms and non-gaming entertainment options will stimulate the market.

“Quite honestly Reno has needed a bigger and bolder vision for a long time” said Mayor Hillary Schieve who is nearing the end of her second four-year term as the city’s top elected official and is credited with helping to revitalize the city’s Midtown area. “Downtown has suffered for many years. We need to bring tourism back but in a different way. I think it's good to have a completely different set of eyes because you have new people coming here.”

Mike Kazmierski CEO of the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN) pointed to Reno’s declining gaming numbers over the past couple of decades as a reason the community needed to shift focus. He cited a UNR study that found 13.8 percent of Reno’s economy in 2002 was driven by gaming. By 2020 that figure was down to 5.3 percent.

“We realized (10 years ago) we needed a new economy” Kazmierski said.

Jacobs Entertainment CEO Jeff Jacobs has owned the Sands Regency in downtown Reno for more than five years with plans to develop the area surrounding the casino into the Reno Neon Line District a mixed-use entertainment and housing project. He began buying up property in 2010.

He headed a similar redevelopment effort in downtown Cleveland some three decades ago.

“We created different districts such as entertainment along the Cuyahoga River. Other parts of downtown came along” Jacobs said of the changes in Ohio’s second-largest city in terms of population.“I think that’s what is going to happen here … We’re planting seeds for change.”

Brendan Bussmann a partner in Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors who has studied Reno for clients said the city “clearly has the need to diversify and is transitioning older assets to support affordable housing and other amenities for the changing dynamics in Reno.”

Gaming revenues up in 2021

Ironically Reno’s casino market is in the midst of its best gaming revenue performance since 2005. Reno casino revenue for the first nine months of the year is 16.8 percent ahead of 2019’s pre-pandemic figure of $636.9 million according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

“Reno continued to benefit from strong population migration dynamics from California and other high tax jurisdictions” Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas said last week following the quarterly earnings release by Monarch Casino & Resort the parent company of Reno’s Atlantis Casino Resort. “Management noted the third quarter saw strong demand across all segments with higher customer spend.”

However when comparing Reno’s current situation to 2000 when Reno casinos recorded a single-year record of more than $859 million in total gaming revenues the market still has a steep hill to climb. Reno is 16.1 percent behind the record with just three months remaining in 2021.

Beginning in 2001 the rapid expansion of tribal-operated casinos in Northern California took away customers and sliced into Reno’s gaming market over the next decade. The nationwide recession that began in the late 2000s took another slice out of the Northern Nevada economy

Reno casinos accounted for 11.6 percent of the statewide total gaming revenue of almost $9.6 billion in 2000. By 2019 that figure was 5.2 percent during Nevada’s $12 billion revenue year.

The number of gaming locations in Reno also declined.

According to the Control Board in fiscal year 1995 Reno had 27 locations that reported gaming and non-gaming information to the Gaming Abstract a publication that covers revenues for casinos that grossed $1 million or more during a fiscal year. By fiscal year 2020 the number of Reno reporting locations was down to 16.

Bussmann doesn’t believe Reno will ever return to the level of gaming level it saw in 2000 especially because of California’s continued expansion which saw two tribal casinos near Sacramento open in 2019 and another looking at a 2022 opening.

""There are too many other factors in the region” he said. “While Reno continues to grow it has gone from a larger regional market to a much more locals market.”

Reno’s gaming totals reported monthly by the state include downtown and smaller casinos and multiple slot machine-only locations such as the games inside the Reno Tahoe Airport. But the figures don’t break out results by individual casinos.

Four of the major casinos in Reno — Sands Regency Peppermill Grand Sierra and Cal-Neva — are privately held and do not individually disclose gaming revenues.

Last year Reno-based Eldorado Resorts completed its $17.3 billion merger with Caesars Entertainment taking on the corporate name. The company operates three resorts along Virginia Street — Eldorado Silver Legacy and Circus Circus — collectively as “The Row.”

Caesars folds the quarterly results from its Reno properties into its regional totals that include financial information from 43 casinos in 16 states.

Monarch combines the Atlantis quarterly results with the company casino in Black Hawk Colorado.

A market transforms

EDAWN has focused efforts on bringing technology companies manufacturing businesses and non-gaming industries into the region to reduce the region’s economic reliance on the casino industry.

Beyond the area’s high-profile business developments such as Amazon’s fulfillment center and Tesla’s Gigafactory Kazmierski said dozens of small and mid-sized businesses have relocated or are considering relocating to the area. Company leaders want to see infrastructure added such as affordable housing and services he added.

In his view Reno City Center and other projects will help revive downtown attract additional developments and create a better market for current casino operators.

“For the gamers that are here now these types of non-gaming projects provide them a better market share so they can be more successful” Kazmierski said. “Because you have people here with good paying jobs they have the ability to engage in the downtown area.”

Beavor has not disclosed a cost to transform the hotel-casino into the mixed-use development. Brent Lovett of Luxe Industries who is overseeing the renovation and conversion of the facility’s more than 1.4 million square feet said Reno City Center is the area’s largest “adaptive re-use project ever attempted.”

Beavor’s company also plans to build a 20-story Kimpton hotel along downtown’s riverwalk area. The mixed-use property from the San Francisco-based Kimpton chain will be fully non-smoking. The project includes plans for 270 hotel rooms 50 private condominium residences 60000 square feet of office space and 20000 square feet of meeting space.

Jacobs’ plans for the Reno Neon Line District a roughly 20-block parcel from West Street to Keystone Avenue and from the Truckee River to Interstate 80 include affordable housing through condominiums and apartments.

He’s also looking at restaurants entertainment venues and a festival space. There are also plans to install a 1500-foot-long zipline attraction starting from the top of the Sands Regency which he is in the process of renovating and rebranding at a cost of $400 million.

All told Jacobs said the Neon Line combined with other Reno developments could total between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion in investments.

“I think people are going to start going up vertically for housing” he said.

Watching on the sidelines is Caesars Entertainment. With a combined 4060 rooms nearly 225000 square feet of casino space and nearly 50 restaurants bars and lounges operators of The Row have a vested interest in downtown Reno’s future.

Row General Manager Ken Ostempowski said the casino company wants to be partners with everybody in downtown Reno. He knows attractions outside of the three resorts allow Caesars hotel guests to “see other things.”

At the same time luxury condominiums apartments and other residential offerings mean additional customers and more guests for The Row’s casinos and restaurants.

“We're a huge advocate of additional residential facilities down here” Ostempowski said. “For a city to grow people have to live there. Otherwise they become ghost towns after everybody leaves at night. We’re encouraged by City Center and what Jacobs is doing. It all means more people downtown.”

Casinos are making changes

Reno’s casino community is also focused on expanding non-gaming areas.

Tony Marini vice president of operations for The Row has long worked for the Carano family founders of Eldorado and now top executives throughout Caesars. He said longtime Eldorado customers continue to visit the properties regardless of a new corporate operating structure.

Hotel room renovations have been completed at all three properties including upgrades to the Silver Legacy’s suites. Indoor Top Golf driving range simulators have been added to several Eldorado suites and the Carnival Midway at Circus Circus was “reinvented” with a lineup of new games.

“Gaming is not new here” Marini said. “You just can't just open a door in Reno and expect everybody to show up. You have to have something different and you have to give customers something special.”

In August Monarch CEO John Farahi told The Nevada Independent the company was exploring ideas for a potential mixed-use development on 40 acres near Atlantis that would coincide with a rapidly expanding Reno.

“We want to see what the prospects are for this city” Farahi said. Last week he told investors Atlantis rooms in the property’s original tower would undergo a renovation early next year.

Schieve said tourism needs to return to downtown through “in a different way.” She suggested technology and non-traditional games such as the competitive video game world of esports would attract a younger clientele.

“Reno has an opportunity to really capitalize on that market and have an understanding of this new generation of gaming” Schieve said. “I think a lot of people are forgetting about that.”

A non-gaming focus

Reno’s conversion to non-gaming took a leap forward in 2014 when the shuttered Fitzgeralds Reno was reopened as the Whitney Peak Hotel an independent non-gaming non-smoking 310-room hotel near the Reno Arch. The property includes an indoor climbing gym and “Whitney Peak's Basecamp” a 164-foot-tall outdoor climbing wall that reaches the building’s roof and has been designated by the Guinness Book of World Records as the ""Tallest Artificial Climbing Wall.""

“You have to embrace change. I know it's hard for a lot of people” Schieve said. “That’s why I think it's so critical for the city to build those relationships with developers so that we have a sense of pride in the project but we also have some skin in the game.”

Beavor is already filling up City Center.

In addition to the residential plans the second through fourth floors of the main tower have been leased by a technology company. The space will be converted to offices for roughly 600 workers.

“Hopefully some of them will be living on our property” Beavor said. “When they get off work they will probably stay around and activate downtown.”

Beavor said Fine Entertainment of Las Vegas which operates six PKWY Taverns in Southern Nevada will bring a couple of restaurant concepts to the facility. There will also be a coffee bar a gym and pet daycare facility for residents.

The site has retained its gaming entitlements but there will never be a full-scale casino he said. More likely a bar or tavern operator could gain a restricted gaming license for up to 15 slot machines. The former Harrah’s Plaza along Virginia Street is being converted into an outdoor park-like setting.

Once the first tower renovation is completed Beavor said the company will focus redevelopment on the east tower which is being used to house construction workers.

Jacobs’ attention is on the area west of The Row properties.

Last week the Reno City Council voted to adopt an ordinance approving its development agreement which covered financial incentives and development standards for projects within Reno Neon Line district.

From his 17th floor office atop the Sands Regency Jacobs can point to some of the locations for the Neon Line elements. He said the initial effort will be in residential areas. He is putting two sites out for bid for third party developers.

“This is an Opportunity Zone (which includes tax breaks and other development incentives) so I think I'll see some of those folks coming around here in a few months” Jacobs said.

UNR seeks a ‘connectivity’

Everyone interviewed mentioned another party interested in helping revive downtown Reno — UNR President Brian Sandoval.

The former governor who took over the university’s leadership 13 months ago said in an interview that connecting the college to downtown would benefit both locations. UNR and the downtown area are separated physically by I-80 but connected through several overpasses.

UNR already has Canyon Flats a 200-bed off-campus student housing development on the downtown side of I-80. It is roughly a five-minute walk from campus along Center Street.

Sandoval has other ideas to establish a connection between UNR and downtown. Initially he would like the Reno City Council to rename Center Street to University Way.

“That creates even more connectivity with the community” Sandoval said. “But second it can be a catalyst for a university district in the future given that you already have Canyon Flats.”

The second piece is the Mathewson University Gateway the future home of the school’s College of Business a life sciences building and a third-yet-to-be determined building. Sandoval is hopeful the business building can serve as a connection with downtown Reno.

“We're exploring the possibility of a public-private partnership where we would work with the business community and have a combination of your traditional classroom and conference space” Sandoval said.

He has also chatted with Schieve about improving bicycle lanes to further connect downtown with UNR. Sandoval also said he has talked with several developers including Beavor about partnering on affordable housing for graduate students.

“The amount of development and private investment is really going to change the face of Reno” Sandoval said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvQWJzaW50aGUtcHJvZHVjZXItbmV3LXNob3dzLWZvci1DYWVzYXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Absinthe producer Caesars plan new shows for three cities,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/North-America-Travel/Absinthe-producer-new-shows-for-Caesars on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvQWJzaW50aGUtcHJvZHVjZXItbmV3LXNob3dzLWZvci1DYWVzYXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbGEuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMzAvc3BvcnRzLWJldHRpbmctbGF1bmNoLWhvcnNlc2hvZS1jYXNpbm8tYm9zc2llci1jaXR5L9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbGEuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMzAvc3BvcnRzLWJldHRpbmctbGF1bmNoLWhvcnNlc2hvZS1jYXNpbm8tYm9zc2llci1jaXR5Lz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sports betting begins at Horseshoe Casino in Bossier City,"BOSSIER CITY La. (KSLA) — Caesars Sportsbook launched in-person sports betting Sunday Oct. 31.

Sports betting kicked off at 7 a.m. at Horseshoe Casino in Bossier City and Harrah’s in New Orleans. The first legal bet was placed at Paragon Casino Resort in Marksville earlier this month.

Caesars Entertainment Sportsbook manager Quinton Harris told KSLA the first bet made Sunday morning was a $55000 wager.

“We thought it was going to go live a couple months ago. It looks like they wanted to do the internal controls to make sure everything was good” Harris said.

Sure enough the start date for sports betting in northwest Louisiana matched up with previous predictions for the end of this month. These predictions came following setbacks due to Hurricane Ida.

“[People] say they’ve been waiting for this for a couple of years” Harris said. “They were anxious and amped up to get this going. That’s one of the things I noticed differently in this crowd than other states.”

The sports betting area is temporarily on the first floor. Harris said the permanent location is under construction and expected to be finished early next year.

In preparation for possible mobile betting one can download the newly newly launched Caesars Sportsbook app. However mobile betting is still pending regulatory approval.

Sting is a man clearly comfortable in his own skin. He’s comfortable in his attire too.

The rock star arrived in a canary (in a coal mine)-yellow suit a black T-shirt and black work boots on Friday night to open his “My Songs” residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Conscious of his stage appearance Sting asked if we liked the suit. Cheers. He was worried it might be “too yellow.” Never. The bumble-bee color scheme fits the name of the man born as Gordon Sumner.

Of course a suit style has hardly anything to do with musicianship how well the front man sings or what songs are played. He later joked that he’d seen Lady Gaga on Thursday night at Dolby Live was “blown away” by her performance. However he did notice she “changed costumes after every song.” He then took off his jacket and said “This is my costume change.”

But through all of it Sting showed you can still look like a mature rock star at age of 70 while delivering hits dating 45 years. And he owned this show a completely confident and stylish Vegas headline production.

Establishing a mood that was spirited and a tempo consistently “mid” Sting and his crisp backing band performed most of the hits of his solo career and time with The Police. He never did mention that band specifically but did open with a chic unhurried take of “Roxanne” with “Paris 1979” displayed on the screens. The curtains dropped for “Las Vegas 2021” drawing a grateful cheer.

“Thank you for your patience” Sting acknowledged remarking that the residency was more than two years delayed. He later said he’d been advised that in Vegas you play “just the hits.”

“That’s all I have are (expletive) hits” Sting said drawing more cheers. It’s not far from the truth. “Every Breath You Take” was awarded by Broadcast Music Inc. as the most-played song in radio history. But he did perform a couple of selections from his latest album “The Bridge” including “Rushing Water” and “If It’s Love” in which he sings several segments.

He explained that he has often heard folks whistling his songs during day-to-day activity washing windows and such.“When you hear someone whistling your song you know it’s a hit.”

The superstar made judicious use of his surroundings. “Every Little Thing She Does is Magic” featured video of pinwheeling fireworks. A starry night flourished in “Walking On the Moon.” A sea of vintage black-and-white TV screens backs “Every Breath You Take.”

“I saw #LadyGaga last night. She blew my mind. She is so talented … But she changed costumes after every song. This is it. This is my costume change.” @OfficialSting in total control @CaesarsPalace @ColosseumatCP #RJnow @reviewjournal pic.twitter.com/9SDXP5AD55 — John Katsilometes (@johnnykats) October 30 2021

But primarily its the front man and his band working together through his deep catalog of hits. Throughout Sting plays his favorite instrument a scarred but trusty 1957 Fender Precision Bass he’s owned for a quarter-century.

The headliner is casual and confident in his dialogue with the crowd. He described moving from the city to the English countryside “Into a little house … OK more like a castle.” The estate is surrounded by rolling barley fields. “Fields of Gold” is that ballad. The artist dedicated the song to his wife Trudie Styler who was in the audience a moving touch to the residency premiere.

The team of players included the father-son tandem of veteran guitarist Dominic Miller and his son Rufus who is new to the band. The familiarity is evident. For “Brand New Day” Shane Sager plays the familiar harmonica licks performed by Stevie Wonder in the studio. Sting reminds the crowd of Wonder’s contribution and said “You have some big shoes to fill. Are you up for it?” Sager gave a quick grin and performed the pieces perfectly.

The show ended with a return to “Roxanne” the familiar original version; “It Don’t Mean a Thing” “Next To You” and a soft landing with the acoustic “Fragile.”

At the close drummer Josh Freese hustled over to Sting’s side for the final bow and energetically slapped his outstretched hand. It was a sign of excitement something a teammate would do after a score. It was the right move. Looking like a champ the man in yellow won the night.

The Bev!

We had a drop-in from the actor who portrays Bébé François in “Mystere” music from Raiders’ band leader David Perrico with Las Vegas Academy students a quote from fabled Las Vegas arts supporter John Quincy Adams and a parting gift of … dirt.

All of it from Friday’s “GroundTaking” at the Beverly Theater next to The Writer’s Block at The Lucy in downtown Las Vegas. The 14000-square-foot arts haven is set to open mid-to-late 2022. Those who took part in the event were given glass jars of soil as original “Groundskeepers” of the project

The theater is named for Beverly Rogers of The Rogers Foundation who was married to Vegas media mogul and passionate philanthropist Jim Rogers. Those who helped enliven the event were The Beverly Creative Director Kip Kelly ex-Clark County Commissioner and The Rogers Foundation co-trustee Rory Reid and RJ Owens of “Mystere.” The venerable Cirque performer showed up as an unbilled construction worker to needle Kelly and also to recite a bit of poetry.

A sample: “Those moments are priceless … when the audience is moved to silence; stirred by something so deep so profound — a legitimate presence that they respond with an absence of words or even movement.” The man with the hammer nailed it.

Anyway … Expect independent film Vegas-bred music artistic performances literary experiences and educational programming every day and night of the week (Rogers has said to expect matinees as she is not such a night owl). Also we are interested in the CineVegas Film Festival title one day being tied to the Beverly Theater programming.

Suffice to say we are all in with this team. As Reid quoted the esteemed JQA (John Quincy Adams) “If your actions inspire others to dream more learn more do more and become more you are a leader.” The Rogers Foundation is filled with such.

A tiger in the tank

The parody musical based on “Tiger King” starring Enoch Augustus Scott of “Zombie Burlesque” is planning to open by Christmas at V Theater at at Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. The project was originally dubbed “Tiger Thing” and might be “Tiger Party” when it’s ready for action. Whatever the case Scott has been working on this show for about a year and the timing is optimum as “Tiger King 2” is set to premiere on Netflix on Nov. 17. Our only question is what took so long?

Cool Hang Alert

The sizzling Alli Starr and the Allikats (no relation) head up the 80s-themed “Supersonic Tuesdays” party at 9 p.m.-11 p.m. Tuesdays at Cork & Thorn 70 W. Imperial Avenue. The band’s title hints to Starr’s first name yes and also the alley entry into the venue. A very cool hang and no cover at owner Randi Garrett’s Arts District haunt.

Then one summer afternoon in early June everything changed.

Writer Valerie Solanas went into Warhol’s office pulled out a gun and shot him. Warhol just barely survived the shooting but some have said it may have led to his death nearly 20 years later.

But how many have remembered the attack on the man who claimed everyone would be famous for 15 minutes is a saga unto itself.

The Artist and The Writer

Andy Warhol was from the working-class blue-collar city of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. But from a young age he had his sights on a bigger world than the one his immigrant parents raised him in. In 1949 he arrived in New York City and immediately got to work as an illustrator for various ad agencies.

“In early 1961 he really turned himself into one of the new pop artists of that moment” “Warhol” biographer Blake Gopnik told Inside Edition Digital. “He had a big hand in creating the movement known as pop art where artists took everyday objects objects made commercially and presented them as the subject of fine art. And that's really his discovery.”

He would go on to shake up the art world and the scene in New York City from his infamous Silver Factory his Midtown space he used as an office art studio and event area. Inside “The Factory” he dictated what was cool.

“Andy Warhol is possibly the greatest artist of all time. He redefined what art is. He not only elevated drag and trans personalities to the realm of superstar he changed what cinema can be what art can be” culture critic Michael Musto told Inside Edition Digital. “He took American capitalism and consumerism and spat it back in your face by doing Campbell's Soup art and he made a fortune while doing it. And at the same time he conquered every medium there is and was a very inspiring person on the scene.”

People sought out Warhol’s validation and approval. His endorsement was life-changing and career-catapulting.

“Just having him in our midst was like having some great messiah or wonderful shaman who seemed to know everything and was clued in. And we turned to for guidance we turned to him for validation” Musto said.

And there was no better place to seek Warhol’s approval than The Factory. One such person who flocked to the creative’s headquarters was writer Valerie Solanas.

Solanas who grew up in New Jersey had a traumatic upbringing. She was reportedly sexually assaulted by her father at a young age and allegedly physical abused at the hands of her grandfather

She left home when she was 15 and soon became pregnant. She went on to have two children a girl and later a boy whom she had to give up.

“Her daughter her first child was raised so she was sort of sent away to have the baby and then she was raised as her sister” Breanne Fahs who wrote the biography “Valerie Solanas: The Defiant Life of the Woman Who Wrote Scum (and Shot Andy Warhol)” told Inside Edition Digital.

Solanas’ biological son told Fahs he had no contact with her after he was placed for adoption.

Solanas went on to get a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland. She attended the University of Minnesota's Graduate School of Psychology before dropping out and moving to attend Berkeley where she took several courses.

It was during this time that she came out as a lesbian and began writing. what she called the “SCUM Manifesto.” SCUM stood for Society for Cutting Up Men.

“The ‘SCUM Manifesto’ which involved overturning capitalism getting rid of everything especially men. She just wanted men to be eliminated from the populace. People said ‘Oh she's kidding. It's a satire.’ She said ‘No I'm not’” Musto said.

Solanas struggled with mental health and as she was finding her path in life she stood out from the crowd according to Fahs.

“Here's a very bright very ambitious woman she sort of sticks out like a sore thumb from the pearl-clutching kind of the '50s and '60s women that are her contemporaries” Fahs said.

Solanas arrived in New York City in 1962. It was there and then that she set out live her truth as best she could Fahs said.

“This bohemian New York City scene where she's finally in a place where she gets to sort of be openly bisexual openly lesbian openly whatever she wants” Fahs said.

Solanas eventually moved to the Chelsea Hotel which had long been home to artists writers musicians and other people who didn't quite fit into mainstream society. Solanas did odd jobs and sex work while she pursued her career as a writer and obsessed over “SCUM.”

She wrote and obsessively revised “SCUM” between 1965 and 1967 according to Nicole Dezelon associate director of learning at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.

“Initially she self-published the document and sold mimeographed copies to men for $2.50 but women could have it for a dollar which I think just sums up the philosophy of Valerie Solanas right there” Dezelon said.

While living at the Chelsea she met and signed the rights to “SCUM” over to publisher Maurice Girodias.

“She signed a contract with Girodias to publish ‘SCUM Manifesto’ but as her paranoia worsened she kind of misinterpreted the document and the contract and feared that she had signed away the rights to her future her writings as well” Dezelon said.

It was during this time that she also met Andy Warhol and tried to get the artist to produce her play “Up Your A**.” She gave Warhol one of her only copies of the play. Warhol reportedly discarded it and laughed at how explicit it was. But Solanas would not be deterred. She continued to follow up with Warhol about the play and he began feeling bad. He began giving her money and paid her $25 to act in his experimental film “I a Man.”

But the more flippant Warhol became with Solanas the more her paranoia heightened. When Warhol told Solanas he would give her a job as a typist at The Factory because of how well-typed her play was she took the gesture to mean he was trying to steal her property Dezelon said.

“So she developed this theory that [Girodias] and Warhol were both conspiring to steal her work but in reality the two men they barely knew one another” Dezelon added.

The Shooting of Andy Warhol Amid a Changing America

In early 1968 Warhol moved out of the Factory in Midtown and into a new place in Union Square which many still called his Factory. As the artist marked a period of change for himself America was seeing its own revolution.

The Vietnam War which was still raging divided America into Hawks and Doves or those who supported the fighting and those who didn’t. Students protested on campuses and cities across the country. In February 1968 sanitation workers went on strike in Memphis. It became a watershed moment for the Civil Rights movement.

That March President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek reelection opening the door for New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy as the Democratic favorite. In April Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis by White Supremacist James Earl Ray; two days after King’s killing the Black Panthers and Oakland Police engaged in a shootout that saw 17-year-old Bobby Hutton shot dead as he tried to surrender.

New York City saw its fair share of upheaval as well. Students protested the war and that February sanitation workers went on strike demanding better wages and leaving the streets of the five boroughs piled high with trash for nine days. That spring the musical “Hair” introduced audiences to sex drugs and nudity on stage.

“In the '60s America was in tumult. There was a lot of rage in the air along with the hippy dippy love fest that was the counter to that. And there were assassinations left and right” Musto said. “Things seem to be helter-skelter and out of control. And it set the scene for Valerie Solanas for somebody that unhinged to claim center stage in such a dark dangerous way.”

On June 3 1968 Solanas showed up at Girodias’ office that morning. He was not there and she allegedly told his secretary she was planning to kill her boss. She then went to Union Square and waited for Warhol outside his office.

Warhol arrived at the office later that afternoon. Solanas and Warhol rode the elevator together up to his office where a group of people were already congregated. As those people began speaking to Solanas she reached for something.

“All of a sudden she pulls out a gun and starts shooting for no real reason” Gopnik said.

Solanas used a .32-caliber pistol to open fire. She eventually struck Warhol hitting him with a bullet that ripped through many of his major organs.

“Warhol falls to the ground cowering he smashes into a desk he smashes his head. And eventually she comes right up presses the gun against his side just under his armpit and shoots. The bullet pierces all sorts of organs” Gopnik said.

Solanas also shot London art critic Mario Amaya who was in the office that day. A bullet grazed his back. He was discharged from the hospital later that day. Solanas also aimed at Fred Hughes Warhol's business manager who pleaded for his life. As begged to not be shot the elevators abruptly opened.

“Solanas flees the scene of the crime and rides down the elevator. So you couldn't get any more cinematic than that” Dezelon said.

Three hours after the shooting Solanas surrendered to the NYPD near Times Square telling a traffic cop that Warhol “had too much control over my life.”

Solanas quickly became the center of the New York media’s attention. The New York Daily News put on their front page the next day with the headline “Actress Shoots Warhol.” Solanas demanded a retraction after seeing it reportedly telling the paper “I'm a writer not an actress.” The Daily News issued the retraction and changed the headline for the later edition of the June 4 1968 paper.

The Aftermath of the Shooting of Andy Warhol

It took nearly 20 minutes for the ambulance to arrive following the first shots inside the office. Warhol was shot just over a month before New York City would implement its 911 system.

Warhol was rushed to Columbus–Mother Cabrini Hospital with a ruptured stomach liver spleen and lungs. It was unclear if he would make it and was pronounced clinically dead.

Doctors massaged his heart and he was then operated on for five hours by Italian immigrant Dr. Giuseppe Rossi.

“My parents had just recently immigrated to the United States and my father was a working doctor and wasn't as plugged into the visual arts fine arts scene certainly not enough for him to recognize the name and immediately know who he was operating on” Dr. Rossi’s son Roberto told Inside Edition Digital.

Dezelon said that Warhol spent two months in the hospital. “His injuries were so severe that he had to wear a surgical corset for the rest of his life” Dezelon said.

Two days after Warhol was shot on June 5 Robert Kennedy was assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan as he spoke to supporters inside the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.

While recovering in the hospital Warhol heard the news that Kennedy had been killed. The news was so surreal that he thought he was dreaming according to Gopnik.

Warhol was eventually released from the hospital but he never forgot what Dr. Rossi had done for him.

“The presence Andy Warhol had in our lives was a very dutiful orchid sent pretty much every holiday season with a thank you note. So we always got an orchid from Andy Warhol around Christmas time thanking my dad. ‘To Dr. Rossi thanks so much.’ And that's the extent of it. My father really did not dwell on this much” Rossi said.

Warhol also gifted the Rossis with a series of paintings of his infamous Campbell’s Soup cans something that Roberto Rossi said was stashed under his parents’ bed because there was no room in the apartment for them to be hung.

The family auctioned the paintings in 2017 for an undisclosed amount.

“We just made the choice that if we weren't going to put them up and we were going to be keeping them in storage wherever it was anyway that there might be people out there who may want to be putting them up” Rossi said.

Following the shooting Warhol chose not to press charges against his would-be assassin.

According to Fahs Warhol said his reasoning was because Solanas was “acting in her nature” and that is who she was.

“Warhol for all of his limitations had this ability to take people for who they were and truly allow them to be extremely weird or eccentric or even violent” Fahs added.

Appearing before a judge Solanas said what she did to Warhol was “a moral act. And I consider it immoral that I missed. I should have done target practice.”

Solanas was charged with attempted murder assault and illegal possession of a gun. She was later declared mentally unstable and a paranoid schizophrenic.

Months after the shooting the SCUM Manifesto was officially published by Girodias and his company Olympia.

“The manifesto would not have been published by Girodias or probably by any other major publisher if it didn't have this sensationalistic story around it” Fahs said.

In June 1969 a year after the shooting Solanas was deemed competent and was able to stand trial. Refusing an attorney she represented herself and pleaded guilty to reckless assault with intent to harm. She was sentenced to three years in prison with one year of time served.

While in prison Solanas tried to get in touch with Warhol in a series of letters.

“She would write him letters like ‘Dear Toad’ and these hilarious hateful strange sort of letters” Fahs said.

Trying to Lead Their Own Lives But Always Together

Warhol continued to make his art and be a fixture of New York City nightlife as he recovered from the shooting. He showed off the scars he sustained from his life-saving surgery to photographer friends and documented his body’s recovery himself.

All the while as Solanas served her time in prison she split the feminist movement of the 1960s into two.

“This shooting didn't just have an impact in terms of the Warhol scene or the art world or that thing. It also had a huge impact on the entire history of the feminist movement from that point forward which largely then divides between radical and liberal feminism” Fahs said. “And we get to see the birth of very different political priorities from that point forward as well.”

Fahs said that some women inside the National Organization for Women saw Valerie's Solanas shooting Andy Warhol as “a symbol of women being pushed to the edge.”

“It's a symbol of women's anger” Fahs said of their take on the shooting. “’We need to see this as a feminist cause. We need to rush to her aid. We need to provide legal counsel. She is one of us.’”

Others inside the organization said violence had no place in the group and didn’t see Solanas as relevant according to Fahs.

Solanas was released from prison in 1971 and continued to stalk Warhol according to Dezelon. The idea of her out of prison frightened Warhol.

“The shooting mercifully did not end Andy's life but it did alter it irrevocably because he was nervous and afraid ever since that happened that it could happen again. And if he ever saw someone that reminded him even vaguely of Valerie he was wary of them. He was terrified of another Valerie Solanas” Musto said. “Andy was a public figure. He depended on going out meeting people in restaurants going to nightclubs. He was always wary from that point on to try to prevent another shooting. It certainly could have happened again with another crackpot.”

By the mid-1970s Solanas was out of prison and found herself homeless in New York City. She had several breakdowns and mental health episodes according to Fahs.

“She becomes completely consumed with a paranoid idea that her uterus has a uterine transmitter that's communicating messages to the mob” Fahs said. “At one point she tries to dig that transmitter out of her body with a fork. It was really violent terrible disintegration of the self.”

She was arrested again in November 1971 for stalking Warhol and went back to prison several times before moving out of New York. She lived in Arizona and San Francisco where she began writing again publishing what she believed was the purest form of the SCUM manifesto.

While living in San Francisco Solanas resided in a single-occupancy hotel Fahs said.

“One of those little welfare hotels that they had at the time” Fahs said. “And she sort of gets into drugs and is prostituting again.”

The Legacies of Andy Warhol and Valerie Solanas

Warhol would take a fear of hospitals from his near-death experience. He continued to face a series of health problems in the wake of the shooting.

“His body had been damaged by the shooting there's no doubt about that he actually had to have follow up surgery…he had infections or all sorts of problems. And he for a while at least is taking speed every day he's addicted to or he takes a lot of Valium he's on downers he's on uppers he's part of the party scene. None of that's great for your body” Gopnik said.

Warhol suffered from an infected gallbladder but wanted to find a holistic cure. However his condition became so bad that despite his fear of hospitals he went under the knife in February 1987 for gallbladder surgery.

“What people call a routine gallbladder operation that Andy underwent in 1987 wasn't really routine at all. It was tricky it wasn't beyond the skills of this very talented surgeon but it wasn't straightforward at all. Andy has simply left his illness go too long his gallbladder was too rotten there was too much infection” Gopnik said.

Warhol’s heart gave out on Feb. 22 1987. He was 58. Some say his death was a result of the shooting.

“Somewhere around 4 o'clock in the morning his heart stopped. They tried to revive him they tried again and again. They did find his heartbeat again I think two times they did CPR they inject him full of all sorts of emergency drugs to bring him back to life. But in the end frankly his heart just stopped” Gopnik said.

Musto eulogized Warhol in The Village Voice where he declared “The Death of Downtown” because of the artist’s death.

“One of the impetus for that was not only that the clubs were kind of tired or closing but our leader was gone. He was the leader of the scene. He was a leader of the nightlife scene the art scene the magazines everything” Musto said. “He really was like the unofficial mayor of New York.”

Solanas was told the news by a friend and former Factory alum Ultra Violet.

“Ultra Violet calls Valerie Solanas and says ‘Did you hear the news about Andy Warhol?’ And Valerie had not heard” Fahs said. “It was kind of like the reaction was basically like ‘Oh he died? Yea. Let me ask you some questions about the copyright for the SCUM Manifesto. How do I get to the Library of Congress and get the copy?’”

“Andy always felt everyone on Earth will ultimately have their own TV show and be famous for 15 minutes” Musto said. “Tragically enough Valerie Solanas became famous as a result of shooting Andy Warhol. But it also made him more famous in a way he didn't want. It did generate a lot of publicity but it's not the kind of publicity he relished. He wanted things to be happy. He loved gossip. He liked being a bitchy queen believe me but that's about as mean as he got.”

Just over a year after Warhol’s death Solanas died of pneumonia at the Bristol Hotel in San Francisco where she was living in squalor. Her body was found after the owner arrived looking for her due to delinquent rent payments according to Biography. She was 52.

“She's stuck in that world where she is forever linked to Andy Warhol instead of to herself which is maybe the most horrifying outcome for somebody who always wanted to be self-defined and who never would have wanted to be defined according to being associated with a man” Fahs said. “She is interesting in her own right.”

The incident between Solanas and Warhol has been referenced many times over the years in pop culture.

Lou Reed wrote two songs over the years to cheer up his mentor and close friend. In 1969 he released “Andy’s Chest” and later in 1990 Reed and John Cale released “I Believe.” Both songs reference the near-death experience the artist had.

Solanas was portrayed by Lili Taylor in the acclaimed 1996 film “I Shot Andy Warhol.” In 2017 Lena Dunham played Solanas in an episode of “American Horror Story: Cult.”

Dezelon said that Solanas’ script she gave Warhol for her play “Up You’re A**” was found by the Andy Warhol Museum years later.

The SCUM Manifesto continues to be published to this day but its popularity pales in comparison to Warhol’s art which is as popular today as it was when the artist created it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Best transfer options

That's a lot of information to take in. So which programs are the best options for domestic flights? In no particular order:

British Airways' distance-based award chart has some sweet spots for short and medium-haul domestic flights operated by American or Alaska. Specifically Zone 1 flights in the U.S. (up to 650 miles in distance) price at 7500 miles in economy or 15000 miles in business class and Zone 2 flights (up to 1151 miles in distance) cost just 9000 miles in economy or 16500 miles in business class.

This opens up some valuable redemptions like New York-JFK to Miami (MIA) in a lie-flat seat for just 16500 miles or Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) for only 9000 miles in economy. Additionally you can book economy flights to Hawaii from several West Coast cities (less than 3000 miles) for only 13000 miles each way.

Another excellent option for domestic flights is Etihad Guest which allows you to book American Airlines award flights for 12500 miles each way in economy and 25000 miles each way in first class. Both of these match American's saver award rates through the AAdvantage program but unfortunately you'll have to call to book.

Turkish Miles & Smiles offers hands down the most generous domestic redemption awards on U.S. carriers of any award chart. It charges a flat 7500 miles each way in economy or 12500 miles each way in business class for any domestic route. This includes flights to Hawaii premium transcontinental routes and flights to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These rates are a fraction of what United would typically charge for these flights.

Singapore KrisFlyer can be a great option for booking Alaska Airlines flights. Coach flights start at just 7500 miles each way and top out at 12500 miles including Hawaii and Alaska. You will have to call to book though. And don't bother considering first-class awards as you'll need to use anywhere from 17500 to 47000 miles each way and Alaska doesn't offer lie-flat seats.

The KrisFlyer program also partners with United but you'll be much better off transferring to and booking with Turkish for these flights.

Decent options

Some of Capital One's other partner programs have decent award rates. So under certain circumstances it could make sense to use these options:

Avianca LifeMiles

If you don't want to book through Turkish you can also get great award rates on United with Avianca LifeMiles. The LifeMiles award chart divides the continental U.S. into three zones and if your origin and destination are both in a single zone you'll redeem just 7500 miles each way.

In most cases these will be short-haul United flights but there are some geographic sweet spots. Here are some examples of flights that require 7500 miles each way:

Colorado to California

Florida to Montana

Maine to South Carolina

Even better? Despite what the award chart says Avianca prices some award flights at just 6500 miles each way. Plus awards between continental U.S. zones top out at just 12500 LifeMiles each way in coach and 25000 miles each way in business including premium transcontinental routes.

Alternatively the Aeroplan program can also be a solid option for United flights especially since you can easily book partner awards online. Awards start at 6000 miles each in economy class for flights of 500 miles or less and become more expensive as the distance increases.

While there are no fuel surcharges Aeroplan does charge a CA$39 ($32) per-person partner booking fee. So you should only consider this option if you run into issues with Avianca LifeMiles or Turkish.

Air France-KLM

Flying Blue has a dynamic award formula so there's really no telling how many miles an award flight on Delta will require. However they generally start at 11500 Flying Blue miles each way in economy.

You should be able to book online but the Flying Blue website is notoriously unreliable and has had issues displaying Delta-operated award flights in the past. If you're having trouble finding availability online try to use mobile apps to beat Flying Blue restrictions on award searches.

Cathay Pacific Asia Miles

The Asia Miles program offers domestic award flights in economy class on both American and Alaska. You can book Alaska award online but not American.

Redemption rates vary by route but you can check the rates on Cathay's website for your specific route. For example you can fly from New York-JFK to Los Angeles in economy for 15000 miles or in first for 45000 miles.

Emirates Skywards

With Alaska out of the picture Emirates' only U.S. partner now is JetBlue. Domestically you can book coach awards as well as Mint flights. The pricing is based on the route but there is some good value to be found (see the award chart here).

For instance Mint awards on transcontinental routes cost 52000 miles. By comparison JetBlue's own TrueBlue program typically charges at least 82200 TrueBlue points for transcontinental Mint awards. Even better you can book these awards online.

You can easily book awards on American Airlines using Qantas miles. Award rates start at 8000 miles each way in economy class and 18400 miles each way in domestic first class on two-cabin aircraft for flights of 600 miles or less. While those are decent rates British Airways and Etihad offer slightly better award rates and should have access to the same inventory. So you'll want to consider those options first.

Poor options

Some of Capital One's airline partners have such unfavorable award charts for their respective U.S. partners that it's difficult to imagine a situation where you should transfer miles to one of them for a domestic award:

Aeromexico

EVA

Finnair

TAP Portugal Miles&Go

The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card Capital One Spark Miles for Business and Capital One Spark Miles Select for Business let you redeem your miles for one cent each as statement credits towards any travel purchase you've made within the last 90 days. So how do you decide when to transfer miles and when to redeem for recent travel purchases?

T he information for the Capital One Spark Miles Select for Business has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

At its most basic before you transfer make sure the airline miles you'll be using will be worth more than one cent apiece for the award redemption you want. If not you'll be better off simply redeeming your Capital One miles directly for travel as a statement credit. Here are five factors you should consider.

Cost

The easiest way to start looking for a domestic flight is to check your favorite airline's price and search an online travel agency for the lowest prices (or consider Google Flights for a quick snapshot).

As noted above domestic round-trip economy awards booked through Turkish will require you to transfer 15000 miles. As a result if you find any highly-discounted fares for $150 round-trip or less you should likely just book a paid fare and then redeem miles to offset your recent travel purchases.

Award availability

Next look for award availability at the lowest mileage levels using the major domestic carriers' websites (American Delta and United). When you find saver-level award space you can use the chart above to see how many airline miles it will require.

Factor in mileage earning and upgrade opportunities

When you redeem Capital One miles for recent travel purchases you can book tickets the way you usually do.

That means you can earn miles from the flight and get credit towards elite status. If you currently hold elite status you should still enjoy all of your elite status benefits including being eligible for upgrades. You may not receive those benefits when you transfer your Capital One miles to an airline and book a partner award. To estimate the value of the miles you could earn consult TPG's points and miles valuations.

One additional note: if you want to enjoy your free checked-bag benefits on United-operated flights through cards like the United Explorer Card remember that you have to use your card to purchase the ticket. As a result flights in this scenario would be a poor choice for redeeming for recent travel as you'd still need to pay those checked bag fees.

Consider taxes and fees

All frequent-flyer programs will add security fees at a minimum which will be $5.60 each way. However Flying Blue has started adding additional surcharges to Delta awards so remember this when using your miles. Similarly Aeroplan charges a partner booking fee albeit a low one of just CA$39 (US$32).

Think about the risks and hassle factors

When you are faced with the choice of redeeming miles for recent travel or transferring miles to frequent-flyer programs consider the time it could cost you especially if the airline doesn't offer online booking. You may have to create a new account and spend time calling the airline.

There's also the risk that the airline won't be able to see the award you want or that the award could disappear before you receive your airline miles. For these reasons you should default to redeem miles toward recent travel when you won't save a lot of miles by transferring them -- especially when you aren't familiar with the frequent-flyer program.

Bottom line

Capital One took a significant step forward when it upgraded most transfer partners to a 1:1 transfer tier. After all this redemption option significantly boosted the value of Capital One miles -- and the value of holding Capital One cards like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card and Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card.

If you need to book flights within the U.S. Capital One's transfer partners give you various options some with solid redemption rates. Just be sure to crunch the numbers to ensure you won't get a better value by redeeming miles for recent travel purchases.

Radio: WROR WTEM

Capital One Arena

For the second time in four days the Celtics will face the Washington Wizards. The Wizards came out on top on Wednesday at the TD Garden as the Celtics could not match the Wizards effort. The Wizards went on to beat the Atlanta Hawks 122-111 on Thursday without Gafford or Dinwiddie. The Celtics have not played since Wednesday’s loss to the Wizards at home.

This is the second of four games between these two teams this season. They will meet once more in Washington on January 23 and again in Boston on April 3. Four of the Celtics’ next five games are on the road. That may be a good thing because the Celtics are winless at home but 2-1 on the road. Much has been said by coach players and fans about the Celtics lack of effort in Wednesday’s game. Hopefully we will see more energy and a better effort in this one.

Marcus Smart did not travel with the team to Washington and will miss this game due to illness. He has been battling migraines and an intestinal illness for at least the past week. I am guessing that Dennis Schroder will get the start in his place. Aaron Nesmith also is fighting an illness but traveled with the team and is questionable for this game. Romeo Langford has missed the last 3 games and with a calf injury and is also listed as questionable for this game.

Robert Williams was a late addition to the injury list on Saturday. He is listed as questionable with an illness possibley the same intestinal bug that has Marcus Smart out and Aaron Nesmith questionable. Also on Saturday’s list is Josh Richardson who is having back spasms and is probable for this game. Aaron Nesmith was not on Saturday’s list and so will likely be available for this game.

The Wizards will also be shorthanded for this game. Rui Hachimura remains out for conditioning after missing training camp due to a personal matter. Thomas Bryant will likely be out until at least December after tearing his ACL last season. Cassius Winston is out with a hamstring injury. Anthony Gill is out with a calf injury. Daniel Gafford injured his quad in Wednesday’s game against the Celtics and is doubtful for this game. Montrezl Harrell started at center in his place on Thursday and played very well so I imagine that he will once again get the start.

Key Matchups

Jaylen Brown vs Bradley Beal

This is a key matchup for both teams. Jaylen Brown has been experiencing after effects of the covid that kept him out of most of training camp. He has been very inconsistent so far scoring 46 points in one game and then 9 in the next game. He scored 30 in one game and then 13 in the next. The Celtics need him to be more consistent and hopefully as the effects of the covid wear off he will be. Bradley Beal is having problems of his own. He is averaging 21.5 points per game but is shooting 35.9% from the field and just 17.2% from beyond the arc. He is also turning the ball over almost 4 times per game.

Robert Williams III vs Montrezl Harrell

Harrell started for Daniel Gafford on Thursday and finished with 25 points 13 rebounds 5 assists 2 steals and 1 block. I’m guessing that he will once again get the start in this game. He had 25 points and 11 rebounds in Wednesday’s game against the Celtics and was able to get pretty much whatever he wanted inside. Robert needs to find a way to slow him down in this game.

Honorable Mention

Dennis Schroder vs Spencer Dinwiddie

I’m guessing that Schroder will get the start in place of Marcus Smart. He will be tasked with trying to slow down Dinwiddie who is averaging 19.8 points 4.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists. He is shooting 44.4% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc. He put up 22 points against the Celtics on Wednesday and was held out on Thursday for rest so he should be nice and fresh for this game.

Keys to the Game

Defense - Defense is always the key to winning. In spite of saying that they would make defense their identity the Celtics have been rather mediocre on defense so far. They have a defensive rating of 110.6 which is 22nd in the league. The Wizards are 13th with a defensive rating of 104.7. The Celtics allowed the Wizards to shoot 51% on Wednesday. They have to do better in this game. The Celtics have allowed way too many open threes in each of their games. The Wizards are 3rd in the league with 52.4 points in the paint per game. The Celtics must play better defense both in the paint and on the perimeter.

Rebounding - Rebounding is also always a key to winning. Much of rebounding is effort and focus and the Celtics had neither in their first game against the Wizards who out-rebounded the Celtics 47-37. Way too many times there were no Celtics in the paint for the rebounds. The Celtics opponents get 27.6 of their own misses which is 26th in the league. The Celtics must put out more effort to crash the boards and when they do it usually filters down to the rest of their game as well.

Focus and Effort - Much has been said by Ime Udoka the players the fans and the media about the Celtics lack of effort in their two home games. The players all said they know they have to play harder and have more focus. Ime Udoka told them if they didn’t have more effort and focus in the game than they did in shoot around they would get beat. He was right. The Celtics must play with increased focus and effort if they expect to beat the Wizards who are playing hard and winning.

Be Aggressive - Along with putting in more effort and having better focus the team has to be the more aggressive team. They have to be more aggressive in going to the basket in defending in going for loose balls and just be more aggressive in general. Too many times in the last game we saw the Celtics standing around while Wizards ran for a rebound or for a loose ball. The Celtics have to be the more aggressive team and they can’t let the Wizards play harder than them.

Teamwork - The Celtics need to play as a team on both ends of the court. They need to move the ball and find the best shot on each possession. They have to trust each other to make the right play. They also have to play as a team on defense not missing defensive assignments and backing each other up on defense. When the Celtics have fewer than 20 assists they usually lose. They have to work as a team and play together on both offense and defense.

X-Factors

On the Road - The Celtics are on the road for this game and for four of their next five games. Young players usually play better at home but the Celtics have lost their only two home games so far. The Celtics need to keep their focus and not allow the distractions of playing on the road and in a hostile arena bother them.

Officiating - We have seen some questionable calls as always. The refs have also been calling the game a bit differently than players are used to. Jayson Tatum Steph Curry and James Harden have all complained about not getting to the line. The officials are not calling the fouls where the offensive player in any way initiates the fouls and it’s going to take time for players who are used to getting those calls to adjust. Jayson Tatum needs to adjust and not expect the calls and not lose focus in the game over calls he thinks he should get.

Short Handed - Both teams are missing key players. The Wizards beat the Hawks on Thursday on the second night of back to back games and even more short handed than they are in this one. The Celtics will definitely miss Marcus Smart in this one but everyone needs to up their game especially on the defensive end where Marcus’ absence will be felt the most."

For Margaret “Molly” Rozier Chen M.D. and Heidi Sallee M.D. a life in service came naturally. As the granddaughters of two of the founding members of SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital Dr. Rozier Chen and Dr. Sallee understood innately what a career in medicine meant — and both decided to follow in the footsteps of their grandfathers — dedicating their lives to serving children and families in their St. Louis community.

A Family Affair

Margaret “Molly” Rozier Chen M.D.’s grandfather Austin Sharp M.D. graduated from Saint Louis University School of Medicine in 1950 and joined the original staff at Cardinal Glennon in 1956.

“He had great contributions to the foundation and mission of Cardinal Glennon and he dedicated his life to the health of children and families” Dr. Rozier Chen says. “But I didn’t know him as a pediatrician growing up. I just knew him as my grandfather.”

When Dr. Rozier Chen was in college her grandfather passed away—and his death left a profound impact on her shifting her entire career trajectory.

“I met and read letters from all of his former patients and families he took care of” she says. “It was really special. A whole new side of him was revealed to me and it was through his death that I began to learn about his life of service. I knew then that I wanted to take care of people to treat my patients as my own family the way that he did.”

From that moment onward Dr. Rozier Chen felt called to pursue a career in medicine and was accepted to the Saint Louis University School of Medicine.

""I was excited to be walking the same halls that he walked over 50 years before and often walked by his class photo that was on display outside of the admissions office. I often imagined him giving me a little wink letting me know that he was proud” she remembers.

Later when she became a member of the faculty her grandfather’s presence was still tangible.

“On my first day as a faculty member at Cardinal Glennon I walked into the physician’s lounge and there was his picture again this time as a tribute to the original staff of the hospital. I saw it as another opportunity for him to be watching over me!”

Dr. Rozier Chen’s connections to the local medical community extend beyond her grandfather—her mother has been a NICU nurse at Cardinal Glennon for nearly 40 years.

“She’s the piece between my grandfather and me at Cardinal Glennon” Dr. Rozier Chen says. “My parents have both been really supportive to me throughout my life especially when I was choosing my career path.”

As she considered her options in college Dr. Rozier Chen recalls many people telling her it would be challenging to balance family with a career in medicine—but her parents encouraged her believing that both were possible.

Dr. Rozier Chen’s reality is now the one she dreamed about and she’s proud of the example she embodies for her daughter.

“I want my daughter to see me engaged in a career that I love the same way that I was able to watch my mother and grandfather in their careers” she says.“I want her to find meaning and passion in whatever path she chooses and I hope that I can be that example for her.”

Carrying on Her Grandfather's Legacy

For Heidi Sallee M.D. an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics becoming a pediatrician offered her new insight into her family’s roots. After growing up in California Dr. Sallee didn’t personally know her grandfather — Peter G. Danis M.D. the founder of Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital — but becoming a physician allowed her an opportunity to connect with his legacy.

“I think in some ways I know him better as a physician because of hearing my family talk about his role in founding the hospital” she says. She’s also encountered former patients of her grandfather who have mentioned the impact he had on their families. “Those stories you hear from families when he provided reassurance and caring I love that side of medicine.”

Since her grandfather’s career the field of pediatrics has changed dramatically—particularly for women—and Dr. Sallee looks forward to continuing to advocate for a more equitable compassionate world for female scientists and doctors. She believes that pediatricians can play a unique role in advancing equity.

“So many women are entering pediatrics” she says. “It’s probably about 75 percent. I think pediatrics has been a leader in terms of how to manage family leave. We can be leaders because we’re half a step ahead of other fields of medicine.”

As she contemplates her last few decades in the medical world Dr. Sallee feels a deep sense of purpose.

“To me this career has definitely always felt like a vocation—that I was being called to do this work. When I finished residency I worked for five years in East St. Louis at a community health center and I loved it. When you answer God’s call you can discern it.”

The SLU School of Medicine has played an enormous role in the lives of both Dr. Sallee and Dr. Rozier Chen—and their families have carved a path forward for the future of pediatrics.

“SLU has instilled in both of us a lot of values including the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God” Dr. Sallee shares. “Not only are we walking in our grandfathers’ footsteps but we’re walking in the footsteps of everybody who came before us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzZGsuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbGlmZS9ob2xpZGF5cy9waG90b3MtYmFiaWVzLWRyZXNzLXVwLWhhbGxvd2Vlbi1zcGlyaXQvNjMtZjI4N2ZiODUtMTlmMC00MDk3LWFkMWItNDRlNjU1NWI0YWM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pictures of babies dressed up for Halloween in hospital,"Babies at the Cardinal Glennon NICU and SSM Health DePaul Hospital dress up in costumes.

MANILA – Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go urged Filipinos to put their health first and praised the Duterte Administration's efforts to close gaps in health care access particularly for the urban poor as the 145th Malasakit Center opened on October 25 at the Philippine National Police General Hospital in Quezon City; and the 146th on Wednesday at the Las Piñas General Hospital and Satellite Trauma Center in Las Piñas City.

In his speech Go said the Malasakit Centers nationwide are the service that he and President Rodrigo Duterte promised and to the indigent patients in the country.

“Basta Pilipino poor o indigent patient ka qualified ka sa mga serbisyo nito (As long as you’re an indigent Filipino you are qualified to these services)” he said.

To date there are 80 Malasakit Centers in Luzon 37 in Mindanao and 29 in the Visayas.

Go’s experiences working under then Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte exposed him to the stressful and difficult process Filipinos go through just to seek government aid for their medical bills. These encounters moved him to conceptualize the one-stop shop which he promised to push for during his senatorial campaign.

“Sa twenty-three years kong pagsisilbi sa ilalim ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte nakita ko araw-araw ‘yung mga problema ng bansa. Maraming mahihirap ang pumupunta ng Davao noon para humingi ng tulong sa kanilang pampa-ospital. Ubos na panahon nila ubos pa pera nila sa pamasahe (In my 23 years of serving under President Rodrigo Duterte I saw the problems of the country. Some indigents went to Davao then to just ask for medical aid. Their time and money had been used up for their fare in going there)” Go said.

“Kaya nung naging senador ako itinulak ko ang Malasakit Centers Act. Target nito ay ‘zero balance’ para wala ng babayaran ang mga poor at indigent (That’s why when I became a senator I pushed for the Malasakit Centers Act which aims to have a ‘zero balance’ so that the indigents would have nothing to pay)” he said.

The Malasakit Center brings together the offices of the Department of Social Welfare and Development Department of Health Philippine Health Insurance Corporation and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office under one roof to ease access to government financial and medical assistance particularly to poor and indigent patients.

The one-stop-stop aims to reduce a hospital bill to the lowest amount possible by covering various patient services and expenses pursuant to Republic Act No. 11463 or the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019 which Go principally authored and sponsored in the Senate.

More than three million patients have benefitted since the program was initiated in 2018. There are now 146 fully operational Malasakit Centers nationwide.

In Metro Manila a total of 30 public hospitals have opened Malasakit Centers including the Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center San Lazaro Hospital Tondo Medical Center and the Philippine General Hospital in Manila.

In the 2nd District centers have been launched at the National Center for Mental Health in Mandaluyong City; Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center in Marikina City; Rizal Medical Center in Pasig City; San Juan Medical Center in San Juan City; and the Lung Center of the Philippines Novaliches District Hospital Philippine Heart Center Philippine Children's Medical Center National Kidney and Transplant Institute East Avenue Medical Center Veterans Memorial Medical Center Philippine Orthopedic Center National Children's Hospital PNP General Hospital and Quirino Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City.

Meanwhile the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Caloocan City; Ospital ng Malabon in Malabon City; Navotas City Hospital in Navotas City; Valenzuela Medical Center and Valenzuela City Emergency Hospital in Valenzuela City in the 3rd District have also opened their own.

Similar centers are also found at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa City; Ospital ng Parañaque in Parañaque City; Pasay City General Hospital in Pasay City; Taguig-Pateros District Hospital in Taguig City; and Las Piñas General Hospital and Satellite Trauma Center in Las Piñas City in the 4th District.

During a speech at the unveiling of the Malasakit Center in Las Piñas City the senator who chairs the Senate Committee on Health encouraged hospitals to prioritize the welfare of poor patients particularly those who have nowhere else to turn for their medical needs.

Go has pledged to work closely with the Duterte Administration to improve access and capabilities of hospitals and other health facilities so that they can continue to serve their patients despite the current Covid-19 situation.

Despite filing his candidacy for vice president for the upcoming national elections Go stressed that his focus remains on fulfilling his mandate as a senator and in ensuring public service delivery amid the ongoing crisis.

Go emphasized the importance of continuing to improve governance in order to meet the evolving needs of Filipinos particularly at a time when the ongoing pandemic has altered everyone's way of life.

“It is for this reason that I continue to prioritize improving the delivery of key public services especially health care — in keeping with President Duterte’s commitment to providing a more responsive and compassionate government by bringing it closer to those in need” he said. (PR)",,,,,,

Already a member of the Holland America Culinary Council Sodamin now joins the ranks of Emeril LaGasse and Guy Fieri with Rudi’s Seagrill his first restaurant for Carnival Cruise Line.

Rudi’s Seagrill Restaurant

Location : Lido Deck 8 aft

: Lido Deck 8 aft Type of venue: dinnertime table service at $38 per guest (gratuity included)

Everything about Rudi’s can be summed up with one word: delightful.

Not only was the food and service wonderful but the plating decor and ambiance made for a truly unique dining experience. This is also one of the many restaurants that offer both indoor and outdoor seating options.

Every aspect of the restaurant — from the decor to the table settings — is themed whether overtly or subtly to the sea. My personal favorite touches were the water glasses and candle holder each of which was reminiscent of the sea glass you might find while walking along a beach.

I knew from experience that when you go to Carnival’s steakhouse on night one or two of your sailing they typically give you a complimentary bottle of wine with dinner. Hoping this would also be the case at Rudi’s I made my reservation for the first night of our cruise and was pleased to learn that my hypothesis proved correct! While we usually get the merlot (my favorite) at the steakhouse we opted for the chardonnay since we would be eating seafood here.

Before our appetizers we received an amuse-bouche served in a spectacular bowl. As with the steakhouse the amuse-bouche here might differ from sailing to sailing but we had what was called a Rasberry Sphere in a Cucumber Gelee.

A bit of advice? If you happen to be served this particular dish make sure to eat the sphere in one bite. Trying to bite it in half will likely result in a mess-producing spurt that will leave you wearing at least some of it!

It was strange but we liked it and it was a fantastic way to build on the aquatic theme of the restaurant.

Next up were the appetizers. We ordered the Blue Mussels and the Coquilles Saint-Jacques (scallops). Trust me when I say the photo does not do the mussels — which were excellent — justice.

There were a ton of mussels and they were huge. Also I was glad to have had the forethought to save the bread we’d been served earlier to dip into the mussel sauce.

The scallops weren’t huge but they truly were a treat adorably served on a real scallop shell. They were served in a delicious creamy cheese sauce that has some surprise mushrooms in it. As we do if you like mushrooms this was a bonus as they’re not listed on the menu. If you don’t like mushrooms maybe steer clear of this one.

Next was the soup and salad course. Since neither of the salads sounded particularly interesting or exciting to me (and who knows I may have missed the boat there!) we chose the two soups a Seafood Bisque and a Cioppino. The seafood bisque is probably still my first choice for this course but there isn’t much to say about it.

The best part was the presentation which included revealing the inside of a coral-esque sphere and pouring the bisque over what looked like aquarium decorations. The finished result is less exciting than the initial presentation so since the soup is tasty it’s worth ordering just for the presentation.

The Cioppino on the other hand was a treasure trove of seafood goodness. The “fisherman’s stew” consisted of a light-but-spicy and flavorful broth with just a few vegetables packed full of shrimp clams mussels and fish. It was nearly enough food to be a stand-alone meal. It was one of the top items of the meal but a little heavy on the fennel seasoning for my taste.

The entrees we picked were the Crab Stuffed Lobster Tail Imperial and the Roasted Halibut. The lobster tail was quite large and as advertised stuffed with crab!

If you can’t decide between lobster and crab cake this is a best-of-both-worlds way to go. It wasn’t cooked better than any other lobster onboard but it was delicious.

The halibut was not our favorite. I picked it because I like butternut squash bisque. I didn’t hate the butternut cider sauce but I didn’t like its sweetness as an accompaniment to the fish.

MENU: Rudi’s Seagrill Restaurant

I forgot that butternut tends to be sweet and I don’t particularly appreciate mixing sweet with savory. It also didn’t help that I was already full. Live and learn. I’m sure some people find it delicious. This gives me an excuse to come back and try something different the next time.

The sides were the only things we saw that night that didn’t quite fit the restaurant’s theme. You can’t win them all. The carrots that came with the lobster imperial were perfectly tender and a little bit sweet from the caramelization caused by roasting them.

The crab risotto to be fair wasn’t supposed to be served with the halibut so that may be plated better with the lobster tail. This was the only thing we didn’t like.

While eating it I realized that I wanted a mushroom risotto which isn’t on the menu so that’s a little on me. It was flavored with something citrusy which I usually like for seafood but it was a bit overdone.

Despite being full by dessert time the desserts went down very easily. We got the Apple Cheese Cake and the Chocolate Truffle Cake. The only thing I didn’t like about the cheesecake was that there wasn’t more limoncello whipped cream served with it. It was light enough for me to eat every bite despite the fact it could not be described as a small slice!

The chocolate cake was very dense and the most chocolatey thing I’ve eaten in a long time. That one was harder to get down but was absolutely delectable. The chocolate mousse on top was the best part of the chocolate on chocolate on chocolate dessert.

I’m not sure if it was intentional but it kind of looked like they were trying to make this one into a face as Chef Sodamin is famous for.

I went to Rudi’s on day one of the third-ever sailing of Mardi Gras. This was a brand new restaurant for Carnival so one couldn’t expect everything to go perfectly.

Maybe it was because we went later in the evening when the restaurant wasn’t very busy but we had fantastic service our food came out perfectly and we had a very good experience. This is saying something because that could not be said for most of our dining experiences for the duration of the cruise.

If you want to take advantage of the wine promotion that we did but you don’t care for their house selections you also have the option of buying a bottle off the wine list at 50 percent off.

I highly recommend giving Rudi’s a try — don’t forget to go on the first or second night of your sailing if you want to take advantage of the wine promotion.

First Night:

Ghost Story of Yotsuya

One might think to willingly enter the world of fictional horror is to pursue fear but for true fans of the genre it’s more complicated. We also crave catharsis anxiety frustration and contemplation. The latter need indicates the stream of horror I find most gratifying and perhaps best expresses why I return to horror stories on screen or on the page time and again and why we continue this series of annual horror movie recommendations now in its sixteenth year. A love of horror is I think a kind of solitude and more philosophical than simply an engagement with one’s mortality: it reflects a willingness to give oneself over to moral allegory one that helps make sense of flesh and blood reality. What can make one feel more alive than being able to reach out and touch the thin gossamer curtain that separates our world from the next?

The most frightful supernatural horror stories are frequently morality tales of anguished states of ghostly retribution of intrusions unwanted yet spiritually invited. It’s often said in western culture that lapsed Christians make the best scary storytellers but moral horror is international and nondenominational. Perhaps true lovers of scary stories believe in the possibility yet remain skeptical of a metaphysical extra-reality—a purpose and meaning and moral calculus behind everything and the existence of good and evil. Among the greatest and most gorgeously savage of the horror moralists was Japanese director Nobuo Nakagawa. He is perhaps best remembered today for the delirious Jigoku a movie so rabidly delectably moralizing that it climaxes in an extended grand guignol vision of hell itself detailing the gruesome eternal torments its decadent amoral characters murderous yakuza and their bloodthirsty vengeance-seekers alike must experience as punishment for earthly transgressions. Let that put the fear in you.

The unforgivingly color-drenched Jigoku was one of many films from 1960 that busted cinematic horror wide open a year that included Hitchcock’s Psycho Franju’s Eyes without a Face Wolf Rilla’s Village of the Damned Powell’s Peeping Tom Bava’s Black Sunday and John Moxey’s Horror Hotel and pointed toward a new era of both permissiveness in gore and discomfiting psychological intensity. But just one year earlier Nakagawa had directed a more traditional ghost story that was in some ways the stylistic equal of Jigoku and offered its own brand of gut-punch creepshow theatrics. Based on a famous commonly adapted Japanese horror tale that had originated in Kabuki in the early 19th century Ghost Story of Yotsuya is a classic tale of revenge from beyond the grave that was one of nine horror movies that genre journeyman Nakagawa made for Shintoho studio throughout the 1950s. In the various versions of the Yotsuya ghost fable there have been crucial character and plot differences yet the main thrust remains the same: a lowly masterless ronin named Iemon treacherous in his own right yet also under the influence of an evil Iago-like sidekick Naosuke wishes to divorce the poor innocent Oiwa for a younger woman; with Naosuke’s guidance he decides to frame her as an adulteress before murdering her with disfiguring poison. It will come as no surprise that Oiwa returns to earth as a furious avenging spirit.

Among the story’s earlier adaptations was an extended 1949 version directed by the great Keisuke Kinoshita separated into two feature-length films. Taking the form of a more traditional supernatural melodrama Kinoshita’s black-and-white version luxuriates in the characters’ wayward and tragic lives and offers more detailed psychological nuance that makes the murder of Oiwa all the more devastating and lends her return in part two a degree of poignancy. In contrast Nakagawa in 75 fleet and nasty minutes forgoes pathos. In the very first scene Iemon (Shigeru Amachi) accosts Oiwa’s father to ask for her hand in marriage; refused for his bad reputation Iemon immediately kills him and his brother with a little help from Naosuke (Shuntaro Emi). The murderer summarily marries Oiwa (Katsuko Wagasuki) anyway lying to her that he will track down and avenge “those” who killed her father.

The loveless marriage that ensues is in some ways as harrowing as the many deaths that spatter the film; there is no expression of genuine love between any two people just a series of self-interested maneuvers and painful deceits. Men are callow brutish and given to thoughtless instant bursts of violence; women are their victims—at least as long as they have human bodies. This is an irredeemable world and only in some unknowable afterlife can wrongs be righted. Any satisfaction one can receive as a viewer is in witnessing the wicked get punished. And once it happens it’s all over as quickly and tersely as it began.

There is a dastardly cruelty to Oiwa’s sad death that makes Ghost Story of Yotsuya particularly heartrending; murdered by slow-acting poison that all but mutilates her beautiful face before she finally succumbs Oiwa holds her baby in her arms as she gradually realizes what has happened to her and that her husband is her killer. Nakagawa is such a pitiless filmmaker that even the return of Oiwa is devoid of the traditional relish that should come with tales of violent reprisal. Most often Oiwa appears in the terrible gory shape in which she was dispatched her body nailed to a board and sunk to the bottom of the river her face distorted and misshapen from the poison and her hair and clothes soaked from her underwater grave. Nakagawa’s expressionist greens and oranges highlight Oiwa’s terrifying demonic force allowing us to momentarily feel Iemon’s fear putting us in the uncomfortable position of identifying with a murderer no matter how much we know he deserves the grim death that’s coming to him.

This phantom appears upside down on the ceiling beckons silhouetted from behind screen doors or bubbles to the surface of a bog. Oiwa is hardly a prim and proper ghost with a message to deliver: she’s a nightmarish unsettled form bloodied haggard and single-minded no longer a person but a manifestation of her rage and Iemon’s guilt unrecognizable from her former self. Nevertheless in the masterfully wretched universe spawned by Nobuo Nakagawa she makes for rather great company. — Michael Koresky

Second Night:

Lord Shango

If Black horror cinema can reasonably (if incompletely) be characterized at all it is by the primal divide between the spirituality practiced by our ancestors and the religion of our oppressors. Much of the Black presence in American horror finds its origins in white anxieties around the religion of the slaves a poetic union of the beliefs they carried with them from their homelands mixed with indigenous as well as European folk tradition. In many ways the story of Black life in America is a story of faith in all its promises and limits an enduring embrace of the unknown.

Lord Shango (1975) directed by Ray Marsh from a screenplay by Paul Carter Harrison (the noted Black playwright and professor whose protégés included sisters Phylicia Rashad and Debbie Allen) opens with the pelting of drums cut short by lively gospel music establishing the film’s central conflict. At some point it was released under the puzzling title The Color of Love. The entire cast is Black and despite two or three romantic interests (for one of them dies early on) the main love story is between a mother and daughter; but if love has any color in the film that color is red. Whole scenes are bathed in it: the neon red that floods the nightclub scenes bloodred face paint worn by the mysterious followers of a local religious sect or the crimson wax candles carved into human models whose kindling casts a red glow over the dark bodies doubling them. Red of course is the color of blood and the film is appropriately preoccupied with all its implications.

Shot in Friendsville Tennessee among the bucolic grassy knolls and dusty roads so characteristic of the pastoral prayerful South the film stars Marlene Clark as Jenny a single mother to teenager Billie (Avis McCarther). Jenny longs for another child and at the behest of her pathetic boyfriend Memphis (Wally Taylor) agrees to have herself and Billie baptized. But Billie’s boyfriend Femi (Bill Overton) belongs to a Yoruba religion widely taken for voodoo in the film’s reviews. When he disrupts the proceedings the reverend along with some church elders—including Memphis—forcibly attempt to baptize Femi and end up drowning him in the process. Later a distraught bed-ridden Billie begins having visions of Femi and one night while her mother is out working she mistakes Memphis for her dead lover. After Jenny discovers her boyfriend slept with her daughter she denounces Christianity and kicks Memphis out only to realize that Billie has run away. Jenny then seeks out the Yoruba clan to find her.

Clark is best known for her frankly unforgettable turn as the elegant and spirited Ganja Meda in Ganja & Hess (1973) although she boasts a fascinating horror pedigree beyond this even if none of those films ever touched Bill Gunn’s masterpiece. Before the close of the seventies she would also appear as the chic wife of a wealthy Black hunter trying to locate the werewolf in their midst in The Beast Must Die (1974) in addition to unsuccessful ventures Night of the Cobra Woman (1972) and Black Mamba (1974) where she plays a snake-shifting succubus and witch respectively. The striking beauty made her start as a model and emerged on-screen a naturally regal performer—never haughty or cold—but playfully perhaps petulantly so as if all that dignity merely veiled a youthful incandescence. Even so she convincingly portrays a jaded desperate mother in Shango despite being two years younger than the actress playing her daughter.

The film never quite achieved the same cultural status as admittedly more dynamic blaxploitation exports like Blacula (1972) its sequel Scream Blacula Scream (1973) or Dr. Black Mr. Hyde (1976). But Shango is also not straightforwardly horror although it involves the dead their hauntings and resurrections. It is foremost a thoughtful melodrama distinctly progressive in the way it considers the role of religion in Black communities and in portraying men as Bible-thumping guardians of patriarchal ideologies also capable of murder and the most perverse sexual transgressions. Scenes of the Yoruba ceremonies—with intimate prolonged closeups on the worshippers—are among the film’s strongest and are mindful of the legacy of voodoo as spectacle in Hollywood fare such as Black Moon (1934) or I Walked with a Zombie (1943) where these communities and rituals were inevitably sexualized. No doubt the rise of Afrocentrism deeply influenced the filmmakers’ approach; thus it ends on a politically conscious if unshakably eerie note that seals the film within a Black horror tradition where the corporeal never stood a chance against the spirit world. —Kelli Weston

Third Night:

Malignant

The two 2021 features that in retrospect I most wish I had seen theatrically were Old and Malignant both of which happen to feature the kind of squishy body horror that reduces—or giddily transubstantiates—audience members into paroxysms of gasping disbelieving laughter. If M. Night Shyamalan’s film is arguably the greater artistic achievement James Wan’s thriller is probably the bigger hoot and equally an auteur piece down to the last ghastly millimeter. Somewhere in the first half hour after I’d figured out why poor abused tragically miscarriage-prone Maddie (Annabelle Wallis) kept having Eyes of Laura Mars–style visions placing her at the scenes of various heinous crimes—which is to say long before the script’s official revelation—I flashed back happily to Wan’s 2007 ventriloquist-core thriller Dead Silence with its EC Comics smorgasbord of helpless fleshy marionettes: what better way to satirize the idea of genre director as puppet master than to simultaneously literalize it through an allegory about malevolent forces jerking our strings?

Malignant’s sadistic exuberance begins with the title which tips the Big Twist through its wry use of a clinical vernacular. So spoiler alert: it turns out that contra Arnold Schwarzenegger in Kindergarten Cop it is a tumor—“it” being Gabriel an anthropomorphic teratoma representing Maddie’s deformed (and of course evil) Siamese twin brother. After lying dormant for a couple of decades sewn up into the seams of his sister’s skull Gabriel has been unleashed by an act of blunt force head trauma using Maddie as a vessel for revenge against the doctors behind his surgical imprisonment while also getting in his licks against a host whose life to date has been lived in a state of oblivious psychic repression as to his very existence. “I didn’t ask to be tethered to you” Gabriel rages late in the film. “You don’t deserve your body. I can use it better than you.”

It’s always nice when a movie delivers on its dialogue and the late-breaking knowingly gratuitous set piece in which Malignant’s villain makes good on his claim has already launched it into the cult-film stratosphere melding the kinetic kick of wire-work-style wuxia with wonderfully chunky gore. In an overpriced hire job like Aquaman Wan submitted to the crass temptations of wall-to-wall CGI but befitting a movie that wears its polyglot Psychotronic-cinema influences on its sleeve Malignant features a mix of digital tricks old-school prosthetics ingenious animatronics and virtuoso physical acting the latter courtesy of contortionist Marina Mazepa. As counterintuitive as it may be to deconstruct the technique behind Gabriel’s rampages it strikes me that the collaborative effort to bring this particular monster to life—including also Wallis’s perpetually spooked performance as a woman coming to terms with an imaginary frenemy—recalls the process behind The Exorcist’s Pazazu and while Wan and his co-writer Ingrid Bisu are working in a completely different tonal and thematic register than William Friedkin (their anxieties are biological not theological) there’s an inheritance of the earlier filmmaker’s shameless showmanship.

“There are only three reasons to go to the movies” Hurricane Billy once opined: “to laugh to cry or to be scared.” I’m not sure Malignant necessarily bats better than one for three on this count but by so thoroughly blurring the lines between hilarious and grotesque—and making an honest if again shameless attempt at emotion through the methodical terrorization instrumentalization and emancipation of its existentially snake-bitten yet admirably resilient heroine—it transcends the percentages. —Adam Nayman

Fourth Night:

Dracula

A Hungarian in a black high-collared cape black hair slick and gleaming in the flicker of a candle terribly pale and sinister in his rigid posture descends the great gothic stairs and the words pour out in an exotic accent: ""I am . . . Dracula."" It's a simple sentence yet how it chills how it seduces. Ninety years later Tod Browning's Dracula (1931) feels at times almost airless pervaded not with unmitigable dread but a stifled mustiness. Save the squeak of rubber bats bobbing by the window and the sumptuous swell of the Swan Lake theme playing over the opening credits Dracula is a quiet movie for the first 20 minutes with long periods of sibilant silence smothering the viewer. Then it transmogrifies like Dracula himself into something more loquacious with a lot of stage-y prattling. Yet it's the count's hypnotic entrance—the striking stillness the dichotomy of Lugosi's pallor and the inky blackness surrounding him a well-groomed revenant—that ushered in a new era of horror.

The Universal monster movies are triumphs of practical design work. Think of Dracula's castle sublimely decrepit giant gray walls adorned with decorative spider webs or Frankenstein's mad scientist laboratory with metal apparatuses and chains and dungeon walls and lightning wrapped around a spire. Think of Karloff's flat top perched on a neanderthal brow. Dracula made for around $341000 is a feat of design more than directorial dexterity. The costumes were designed by Ed Ware and Vera West and the sets by Russel A. Gausman. Cinematographer Karl Freund—who pioneered the roving roaming camera; shot German Expressionist films The Golem (1920) The Last Laugh (1924) and Metropolis (1927); would go on to direct The Mummy (1932) and Mad Love (1935); and in a change of pace act as cinematographer for I Love Lucy in the fifties—was given great freedom by Browning making him a sort of uncredited second director. Dracula may lurch at times and the dialogue may have that stand-in-the vicinity-of-the-mic stiltedness but the film looks great. The pristine white of the wives' dresses dragging on the floor behind them the whorls of fog enfolding the castle the shadows swallowing rooms.

Carl Laemmle Jr. son of Universal founder Carl Laemmle took over the company in 1928 and remained head of production until 1936. Though the company had early hits with King of Jazz and All Quiet on the Western Front (both 1930) the monster movies would define Laemmle's tenure and become inextricably associated with Universal. Dracula their first horror movie is based not on Bram Stoker's epistolary novel but the stage play by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston. Before Laemmle reluctantly cast Lugosi (who originated the role on stage) he had considered a litany of other actors including Ian Keith Paul Muni Chester Morris John Wray. Lugosi helped make Laemmle. Whereas the vampire from Murnau's Nosferatu is an unholy abomination a thing more than a man with long curling claws and dilapidated fangs Lugosi has suavity a frightening serenity. It's Bela Lugosi's otherness his odd enunciations and the hint of lasciviousness that stiletto stare that imbues the film with calm menace; it's Lugosi's face that festooned posters Lugosi's silhouette that remains the inspiration for a century of mannerly vampires. Consider Christopher Lee insidiously handsome and eloquent; or Frank Langella the gentleman's vampire; or Gary Oldman crossing oceans of time to find the reincarnation of his long-lost love. There's a hint of Lugosi in all of these; all modern monsters are his progeny. —Greg Cwik

Fifth Night:

Carnival of Souls

The sun was setting as Herk Harvey drove along a stretch of arid highway near Salt Lake City. In the distance he spotted an abandoned turreted building: the remnants of the Saltair Resort a decrepit early-20th-century amusement park. The sight prompted him to place a call back to John Clifford—his screenwriting partner at Centron an educational-film production company in Lawrence Kansas—and suggest they make a horror film prominently featuring these decaying ruins.

Harvey replicates this experience in 1962’s singular unshakeable Carnival of Souls his sole feature narrative in a career mostly of short films made for Centron. As organist Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) drives this very same Utah route her car radio picks up an echoey organ theme that seems to conjure the silhouette of Saltair’s central promenade which resembles a distant mesa in the sunset. Reflected in the passenger window is a ghostly man (an uncredited Harvey) who will pursue Mary for the rest of the movie: his pancake-white face is lit from below with a single harsh beam of light.

Although Carnival of Souls is legendary as a shoestring production—made on a $30000 budget largely with a cast and crew of Centron-adjacent Kansans—its atmospheric sophistication has aged well heavy on ambiguous unease. Harvey envisioned the story as a dreamy blend of Cocteau and Bergman and the film shares an enduring elementality with the work of those filmmakers. One would hardly expect a shot of a building to have such sensory impact but Saltair brings a unique history along with its appearance. Originally constructed in 1893 by the Church of the Latter Day Saints Saltair was once a huge regional attraction a wholesome “Coney Island of the West.” Although the main pavilion burned down in 1925 it was hastily reconstructed by new management who pivoted it into a music hall. In this era Saltair 2.0 boasted the largest dance floor in the world and hosted bandleaders like Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey but after another fire the venue quickly fell into disrepair once again. The forces pulling Mary back to the resort are part of this doomed cycle of birth and destruction.

When Mary sees Saltair for the first time she’s trying to escape her own present. Carnival of Souls begins with a freak drag-racing accident: after a car dramatically pirouettes off a bridge and plummets into the river Mary is the only one of its three young passengers to survive stumbling out of the water in a shell-shocked daze. (Clifford was once incredibly songwriting partners with Angelo Badalamenti so the scene likely influenced Ronette Pulaski’s walk over the bridge in the Twin Peaks pilot.) It’s an odd twist of fate that she even found herself in this situation; before the race began Mary’s eyes darted toward the passenger window as if she wanted to jump out of it. Hoping to tune out the trauma of the crash she finds work as the lead organist at a church in Salt Lake City but despite her chosen musical instrument she is not religious. Although this choice distresses—even offends—everyone she meets she prefers to politely keep to herself.

A popular interpretation of the film is that Mary is in purgatory which manifests as her physical and emotional severance from the living. While shopping in a department store she calls out to a salesperson and finds that no one can hear her; Harvey drowns out all ambient sound beneath the carnival organ theme. But even if she wanted to join in Mary finds herself among a ragtag group of lonely eccentrics. Mary’s boarding-house owner is an old woman with oddly paced speech—after Mary spots the Saltair ghost in the stairwell Harvey inserts an awkward unnerving shot of the proprietor insisting “there’s nobody there” while darting her eyes furtively to the side. Kindly as she is she’s not a peer. For that look no further than Mary’s fellow boarder John who self-medicates his solitude with alcohol and traffics in bizarre wisecracks that might be endearing if he weren’t a leering creep. A man named Dr. Samuels finds Mary in a panic after she mistakes someone in the park for a ghost and he tries to elucidate the roots of her guilt—but he soon clarifies that he is not a psychiatrist after endless attempts to psychoanalyze her. Everyone is if not literally threatening a bit off-kilter creating an atmosphere that could only lead to Mary’s isolation; even religion seems a false lonely promise of salvation.

The inescapable fact of her alienation constantly plays across Lee Strasberg–trained Hilligoss’s expressive alert face. Beyond her suppressed trauma we’re only certain that she’d like some sort of peace. In a sense she finds that calmness at Saltair a place that pushes the idea of “resting in peace” to its existential limit; after all it sits close to the Great Salt Lake often referred to as “America’s Dead Sea.” As Mary wanders the structure she’s struck by the void of life within its grandeur: a magic carpet slides out of nowhere down a metallic slide while old advertisements for the beach call out to leisure-seekers from half a century ago. The promenade is haunted by nothing more sinister than the amusement that briefly thrived there—a parallel perhaps with the death-defying thrill of Mary’s initial drag race. Even the liveliest boardwalk will one day become driftwood.

So when the ghosts finally claim Mary the silence that follows is most chilling. The chase that leads up to her disappearance is terrifying: Harvey alters the frame rate and elevates their ghoulish laughter in the mix and the phantoms glide out of the water in scenes later quoted in The Shining and Apocalypse Now. After the ghosts swarm Mary on the sand the scene cuts to black her vision swiftly extinguished. Her remains are released back to the car in Kansas but the final trace of her stay in Utah is her handprint on the sand—which like the ash-bound pavilion is soon to be swept away by the Earth. —Chloe Lizotte

Sixth Night:

Silent Night Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out!

Full disclosure: I have seen neither the first nor second film in the Silent Night Deadly Night series. Nor the fourth. Nor fifth. I came to 1989’s Silent Night Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out! only at the conclusion of an auteurist round-up undertaken in the wake of director Monte Hellman’s passing earlier this year. The film’s provenance as a direct-to-video cheapie suggested maintaining low expectations but Hellman’s own claim that the finished film showcased some of his best work was intriguing. His pictures from elliptical late ’60s westerns Ride in the Whirlwind and The Shooting through the epochal road trip Two-Lane Blacktop and on to underseen later ’70s glories Cockfighter and China 9 Liberty 37 make for one of the most idiosyncratic and satisfying runs in American movies. Even if Silent Night’s reputation isn’t great I assumed there had to be something in it.

Here we find an impassioned Frankenstein-esque medical researcher Dr. Newbury (Richard Beymer Twin Peaks’ Ben Horne so game for this role that he treats each increasingly ridiculous monologue like it was Shakespeare) trying to connect a young blind psychic named Laura (Samantha Scully) to the comatose murderer of the series’ second installment Ricky (Bill Moseley) via her dreams. It seems the doctor is successful: when the girl falls asleep on his exam table she sees visions of older events lifted I assume directly from previous installments of the Silent Night series. One of the sequences hilariously involves Santa being shot to death in front of a passel of shocked children. Laura lies to Dr. Newbury about what she’s experiencing when she awakens but a single tear forming at the corner of Ricky’s right eye suggests something has been stirred.

This being a Christmas-themed franchise the film is naturally set on December 24th. Laura is in a hurry to get the dream experiments over with so she can head to Granny’s house with her brother Chris (Eric Da Re also soon to star in Twin Peaks) who has his new girlfriend Jerri (we know her as Mulholland Dr.’s Laura Elena Harring but here she’s credited as simply Laura Herring) who looks uncomfortably like his sister in tow. As the three head up to the homestead Ricky awakens wreaks gory havoc in the hospital including filleting a drunken Santa and executes ever more ingenious gambits to track down Laura. For a man missing the top half of his skull and whose exposed brain is protected only by some sort of glass bowl filled with blood he’s a surprisingly deft hitchhiker.

The film opens with a lengthy close-up of Laura that holds before tracking back to a medium a common Hellman start. The cutting throughout is considered and sharp—Silent Night features more than a handful of lingering close-ups of faces eerie frames that last long enough to make one fear what the next shot might bring into view. And throughout Hellman stretches and pulls at time—dropping into a scene far later than you’d imagine letting another linger longer than it seems possible—which casts a film one might expect to be tightly wound in an oddly oneiric haze. The oddity here grants him latitude. There are strange scenes that shouldn’t work in any reasonable movie but here they just…do. Witness Granny opening the door to Ricky inviting him in serving the stranger dinner and offering him a present before he murders her. Hellman even slyly drops in a hint of self-referential humor: a horny soon-to-be-murdered gas station attendant watches The Terror in black-and-white on a small tube set which Hellman directed portions of.

That said making too many grand claims for Silent Night Deadly Night 3 does it no favors. Like so many slasher flicks (and near every Pixar film) this particular contraption climaxes with extended bouts of running and falling and screaming. Many of the protagonists are stabbed which grows tedious. A showdown in a dark basement that should have provided sightless Laura an advantage over her stalker is staged with impressive brio while simultaneously being nonsensical and completely unsatisfying. Cheesy synth overwhelms the soundtrack with tinny ominousness. And Hellman might have been better served (and more fully pointed the way towards Mulholland Dr. with which this film shares some tonal kinship) by switching his lead actresses and placing Herring at the center.

To return to Hellman’s own assessment of the film let us note that he doesn’t label the finished object a personal best but he focuses on the quality of the labor the process. His team worked fast and efficiently moving from concept to production to post to screen in a few months. I wonder if making this reminded him of his start: Beast from Haunted Cave for Roger Corman’s New World Pictures.

Hellman made too few movies but looking back over his career the ones he made all as motley a bunch as it is seem like the right ones. He had a talent such that that somehow after his long break from filmmaking following China 9 he could return a decade later and give us back-to-back Iguana and Silent Night Deadly Night 3 and make them feel somehow of a piece part of a larger project undertaken across his body of work. Though Silent Night Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out! is his only overt stab at the horror genre think back on the unease and violence laced throughout his career. Though he has said he doesn’t like scary movies he’s perhaps secretly one the greatest American filmmakers for the Halloween season. —Jeff Reichert

Seventh Night:

When a Stranger Calls

Whether using words like “shivery” or “hair-raising” or “revolting” the way we try to describe the feeling of horror is often inadequate. This is after all a genre that depends on intangible personal emotional effects. This is especially true because of horror’s reliance on the uncanny: in brief the decentering intrusion of the strange into the otherwise familiar. Whether we take the Freudian definition (related to strange everyday events that trigger something in the unconscious otherwise repressed) or that of fiction theorist Tzvetan Todorov (when an otherwise realistically constructed world strays beyond what we know to be possible or explainable) the uncanny effects of horror seem to be boundless irreconcilable and I think highly individualized.

For me horror and nostalgia feel entirely bound together and I doubt this wouldn’t be the case for many. The destabilizing effects of horror are related to a conception of the past—personal and collective—as much as a fear of change (death). No art form better allows us to enter the past than cinema an uncanny genre in its very being for the way it shows us something familiar (the world as we know it) yet estranging (the world is unreproducible) at all times. Horror intending to produce involuntary “chills” in the viewer only heightens the effect of cinema’s already eerie ontology.

This is all perhaps an overwrought introduction for discussion of a film as humble as When a Stranger Calls. A viewer’s relative response to this 1979 thriller—a once-upon-a-time box-office hit perhaps more referenced and imitated than actually watched today—depends I suspect on a certain proximity to the material. Produced and released the year I was born Fred Walton’s stalker thriller thrusts me immediately back to a time and place that look familiar an era that I only think I understand and that I only pretend is mine. The tactility of the furniture and interior design; the relatability of the architectural layout of the homes; the intimacy of its props and objects (most crucially corded rotary telephones); the preponderance of actors who appeared in so many of the movies (the dreams and nightmares) of my childhood viewing: these are not trifling or superficial matters but the heart of it and I imagine more or less true for any viewer of any generation looking at a regional historical or otherwise textural facsimile of their childhood—the dreaded feeling of having been there and not been there at once.

It’s the first 22 minutes of Walton’s film that everyone recalls first—an elegant evocation of the old (sub)urban legend of the babysitter harassed by a phone caller exhorting her to “check the children” only to have the police trace the call and inform her that “the call is coming from inside the house!” As played by Carol Kane in what only now would be called against-the-grain casting the tormented Jill Johnson is a completely believable and relatable victim of this psychological terrorizing which Walton augments with a series of ominous cutaways (a grandfather clock’s swinging pendulum) and savvy fake-outs (a startling sound from the kitchen turns out to be the freezer’s icemaker). In its odd tranquility and growing sense of imminent peril its shots of shadowy empty rooms and untended-to objects and furniture this first sequence portends The House of the Devil the 2009 Ti West horror throwback that emphasizes the terror of “nothing” (what the great ghost story writer M. R. James might call “The Malice of Inanimate Objects”) allowing the sinister presence of period décor to do a lot of the heavy lifting. By the time Jill discovers the horrible truth of the source of the call—confirmed in just a low-angle shot of the children’s bedroom door opening a shaft of light hitting the top of the staircase landing—and must escape it’s almost a disappointment to leave the house and all this well-maintained atmosphere behind.

In an exceptional example of cinematic “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” this entire opening is a replication of Walton’s own 1977 short The Sitter—also 22 minutes—right down to the inexplicably ghastly freeze-frame-and-zoom shock effect when Jill opens the front door to find a detective waiting eerily still and scowling. In the feature that face belongs to Charles Durning whose recognizability perhaps lessens the moment of terror while indicating that the narrative is far from over. Yet other differences are worth pointing out as they express how much architecture and setting are key to one’s emotional response to horror: chief among these is that in the short the living room is a more wide-open space with less shadowy hidden corners (which makes Jill played here by the more believably teenage Lucia Stralser seem more vulnerable) and is most memorable for its wall-to-wall red carpet (foreshadowing the caller’s eventual taunt that he wants “her blood”). While the sequence in When a Stranger Calls is acted shot scored and edited with more refinement the simplified at times jarringly amateurish feel of The Sitter indicates a certain purity of intent that’s perhaps even more terrifying down to its nastily abrupt ending: the kids had been dead in their beds for hours. (Apparently The Sitter showed in theaters before certain screenings of the singularly horrific Looking for Mr. Goodbar—can you imagine that night out?)

Lest you think my response to the specific layout feel and texture of When a Stranger Calls and my evaluation of it in comparison to The Sitter is an articulation of pure nostalgia I should now add that I just watched When a Stranger Calls for the first time in preparation to write this. Yet when I finally watched The Sitter (last Halloween) and When a Stranger Calls (this Halloween) I felt like not only had I seen them before but also that I had been in these rooms. An almost eye-wavering sense of déjà vu came over me as though they have been a part of my childhood perhaps by virtue of the twice-told tale itself but more specifically the tingling sense it imparted of having sat on those couches walked on those carpeted floors dialed and clutched those rotary phones—all of which take on a simmering danger in Walton’s world. (It’s worth noting that one of Walton’s later projects was the pilot of the 1985 reboot of Alfred Hitchcock Presents which remade the classic 1965 Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode “An Unlocked Window”—maybe the best “the killer is already inside the house!” narrative of them all.)

From what I’ve gleaned about When a Stranger Calls it seems as though many acclaim the opening sequence for its traditional horror beats and elegant construction but find the remainder of the film—set seven years later after the killer Curt Duncan (an effectively haunted Tony Beckley who died six months after the film was released) escapes from a mental institution—wanting for scares. I’m glad to report that I found the entirety of the film pretty captivating: Walton ruthlessly exploits our fears (a throwaway shot near the beginning of kids being carried downstairs in body bags) while also maintaining a surprising humanity (a later image of a supporting character tenderly picking up and hugging his baby from the crib when he’s reminded of Duncan’s murders from years ago). There’s a free-flowing sense of menace maintained throughout which is more nuanced than the opening barnburner might suggest.

When a Stranger Calls is a tactile experience that jingle-jangled my particular pleasure centers not just with its architecture and design but also the appearance of so many standout character actors that lined the cinematic crevices of my childhood: the redoubtable Durning as the police detective turned private eye driven to catch the killer (so driven that at times he becomes a menacing figure himself) Rachel Roberts as an imperious psychiatrist Ron O’Neal as Durning’s sympathetic former partner and perhaps best of all the great smokey-voiced Colleen Dewhurst as a downtown L.A. barfly with whom Duncan enacts an oddly touching yet highly menacing game of cat-and-mouse. (They meet at the no-longer extant Torchy’s Bar shown in exterior shots a landmark also recognizable from Walter Hill’s 48 Hrs.) Entirely unpredictable as ever Dewhurst introduced in astonishingly beautiful profile at the bar is flirtatious and inviting rejecting and cold stern and apologetic all at once and often even in the same line delivery. Duncan follows her home to her lonely city apartment and she relievedly manages to goad the queer duck back into the hallway—though in a terrifically unsettling touch he doesn’t quite close the door on the way out leaving her to gingerly lock up and latch the chain herself. And exhale.

It’s this attention to detail the tiny gestures that create unbearable suspense that make When a Stranger Calls so supremely frightening even before it returns in the final stretch to the traumatized Jill for the last—extremely effective—scare. That the film has Duncan track down and terrorize Jill again doesn’t make a lot of sense but its pleasing narrative symmetry overcomes logic. The structural simplicity—the return to the space of the suburban home after the urban De Palma-like stalkings that make the bulk of the film—speak to a central tension in horror itself between the fear of what’s already inside and what may be coming from outside the known and the unknown the tactile and the inchoate. The uncanny exists somewhere between the two. Either way the killer has already found his way in. —Michael Koresky",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxtdG9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL0ZhbGwtY2Fybml2YWwtcmV0dXJucy10by1TYW1lcy1BdXRvLUFyZW5hLTE2NTc5NDg1LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fall carnival returns to Sames Auto Arena,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Fall-carnival-returns-to-Sames-Auto-Arena-16579485.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxtdG9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL0ZhbGwtY2Fybml2YWwtcmV0dXJucy10by1TYW1lcy1BdXRvLUFyZW5hLTE2NTc5NDg1LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLW9jY3VwYW5jaWVzLW9uLXRoZS1yaXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Ship Occupancies On the Rise,"The new Carnival Mardi Gras is sailing at nearly 85 percent occupancy in the Caribbean according to a social media post from John Heald the company’s brand ambassador.

China's next-generation aircraft carrier-based fighter jet made its long-expected maiden flight recently foreign media outlets reported with unverified photos of the prototype warplane in the sky circulating on social media platforms.If true this would mean a tremendous step for China's aircraft carrier program observers said.The photos show the carrier version of the FC-31 stealth fighter flying. It is painted with a blue-green primer and it has the same twin canted tailfins twin engines and high-mounted cockpit of the FC-31. But it adds a catapult launch bar and a wing-fold mechanism confirming it is intended for carrier operations US media outlet thedrive.com reported on Friday.Other notable features are a chin-mounted sensor turret apparently analogous to the F-35's Electro-Optical Targeting System and what seems to be a remodeled cockpit canopy profile with a shorter main transparency the report said.Developed based on the FC-31 the aircraft carrier-version is almost a new aircraft with many of the latest technologies applied said experts and analysts reached by the Global Times. They declined to confirm the authenticity of the photos but said they are generally in line with predictions.The FC-31 is China's second stealth fighter jet intended for technical demonstration and export purposes and it made its maiden flight nine years ago. It has long been expected that the FC-31 would be upgraded to become China's next-generation aircraft carrier-based fighter jet.During the Airshow China 2021 held in September Sun Cong chief designer of the J-15 China's first-generation aircraft carrier-based fighter jet as well as the FC-31 said at a press conference that ""This year people should be able to see good news on the next-generation aircraft carrier-based fighter jet"" and ""When the aircraft is ready people will get to see it."" Rumored to be designated the J-35 China's aircraft carrier-based stealth fighter is only the world's second aircraft of its kind. It is believed to rival its US-made counterpart the F-35 which is being provocatively deployed in large numbers by the US and its allies near China analysts said.Another crucial aircraft that will be on China's future carriers the KJ-600 early warning aircraft was also seen undergoing flight tests recently thedrive.com reported citing a photo.This means both types of new carrier-based aircraft are at a good stage in the development progress and they will likely operate from China's forthcoming third aircraft carrier which is expected to be larger than the previous two and equipped with electromagnetic catapults analysts said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L2NoaW5hJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1qLTMxLXN0ZWFsdGgtZmlnaHRlci1qdXN0LWJlY2FtZS1jYXJyaWVyLWNhcGFibGUtMTk1Njk20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's J-31 Stealth Fighter Just Became Carrier-Capable,"Its release may coincide with the release of China's new aircraft carrier.

China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) might just have a new stealth fighter—and it’s carrier-capable.

A slew of photos posted to social media shed light on the PLAN’s newest and likely carrier-capable jet. The airplane tentatively a Shenyang J-31 derivative (also known as the FC-31) appears broadly similar to its parent though with several carrier-specific characteristics.

Anticipation prior to the new airplane’s debut ran high with reports about the airplane circulating and the original J-31 circulating online.

The Chinese stealth fighter differs substantially from its larger and perhaps better-known counterpart China’s Chengdu J-20. For starters the J-31 is a considerably smaller aircraft with a more conventional airframe lacking the forward canards that the J-20 has.

It is suspected that the J-31 was initially intended for export with the advantage of offering customers some lower-end fifth-generation fighter qualities without costing as much as premier fifth-generation platforms like the United States’ Joint Strike Fighter.

The J-31 bears more than a passing resemblance to the American Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter. Indeed some reports have pointed to the Chinese plane’s similarities as evidence for Chinese F-35 program technology theft. Both aircraft feature a similar forward fuselage section including a stealthily-contoured nose chine and engine intakes.

Since the original J-31 debuted at the 2012 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition at least one other plane variant has been produced. This second variant featured smoother lines redesigned wing-tail configuration.

This latest J-31 variant known from photographs differs substantially from the previous two J-31 variants. However two crucial points indicate that it is carrier-capable. First it has a larger more robust pair of wheels to support the stresses of carrier operations. In addition its catapult launch bar is also evidence of carrier landing capabilities. And last but not least the newest J-31 appears to have folding wingtips and tail tips giving the airplane a smaller footprint for carrier operations.

The People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN’s) newest stealth fighter variant roughly coincides with the PLAN’s Type 003 aircraft carrier which is expected to launch by 2022 and enter service around 2024. The carrier will be China’s third and most advanced roughly the same size as the U.S. Navy’s enormous Gerald R. Ford-class carriers.

Though much remains unknown about the newest J-31 variant the airplane is notable as just the second carrier-capable stealth aircraft and the first in Asia. The new aircraft may end up flying alongside the J-15 a Chinese-made copy of Russia’s Sukhoi Flanker thought to be an unreliable and accident-prone flyer.

Coupled with a new and domestically built aircraft carrier China’s power projection capabilities are expanding.

After a year of conjecture photos have begun to surface on social media hinting at a carrier-capable stealth fighter jet.

If confirmed this will be China’s second stealth aircraft after the J-20 Mighty Dragon. The latest photographs show a prototype flying for the first time and it’s the first stealthy carrier-capable fighter created outside the US which boasts its Navy’s F-35C and F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing jets used by the Marine Corps.

The latest Chinese aircraft has been labeled a variation of the FC-31 by some local plane spotters. A prototype of the land-based FC-31 was first flown in October 2012 but is yet to secure a purchase order from the PLA or any foreign county.

The new aircraft features the same twin canted tail fins twin engines and high-mounted cockpit as that of the FC-31 but it also includes a catapult launch bar and a wing-fold mechanism indicating that it’s designed for carrier missions.

A chin-mounted sensor turret similar to the F-35’s Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and what appears to be a redesigned cockpit canopy layout with shorter primary transparency are also seen.

And there it is.

J-XY/J-35. When it rains it pours huh?

This new fighter is expected to operate from the upcoming Type 003 carrier as it is prepared for catapult operations from the start.

Rather than depending on the ski-jump ramps installed on the PLAN’s previous two carriers Liaoning and Shandong Type 003 design is intended to be outfitted with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS).

A silhouette of the FC-31 surfaced on the Aviation Industry Corporation of China’s Weibo microblogging site in December 2019 after which Shenyang revealed the development of a ‘new’ fighter fuelling rumors that it was the long-awaited FC-31 carrier variant however no details were offered.

Any idea since when exactly it is there since my last image is from April/June 2019. ? pic.twitter.com/QFifx59dhK — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) June 8 2021

The PLAN has already shown interest in acquiring a naval version of the FC-31. The KJ-600 and J-15T are all up in the air. A naval variant of the FC-31 which would also require heavier landing gear could be ready in the near future.

These capabilities will surely aid the PLAN in accomplishing its long-term goal of establishing a blue-water navy.

The PLA Air Force (PLAAF) has already fielded the J-20 which is roughly similar to the US’ F-22 Raptor. FC-31 on one hand was demoted in favor of J-20 since it was deemed less capable and less expensive. PLAN on the other hand appears to be pleased with its carried-based counterpart and it may acquire it.

China’s New Super-Carrier

Beijing’s Type 003 is considered a significant step forward in its quest to become a worldwide superpower. China’s tremendous naval buildup has included the deployment of aircraft carriers.

Catapults will most likely be used on the next aircraft carrier to launch a larger range of planes more effectively and successfully than the ramp method used on its predecessors. Like catapults the new carrier is equipped with EMALS (electromagnetic aircraft launch system).

Satellite imagery captured in July 2021 shows that Type 003 is almost 320 meters which is about 13 meters shorter than the American Ford Class.

According to a report released by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) China’s area-denial capabilities could improve greatly if the Type 003 aircraft carrier which was developed domestically is completed.

According to the study China is ramping up its “soft kill” and “hard kill” capabilities to damage telecommunications. The former refers to the use of anti-radiation missiles and other weapons to attack and paralyze signal transceiver equipment while the latter refers to the use of anti-radiation missiles and other weapons to attack and disable signal transceiver equipment.

It is believed that Type 003 will be equipped with 40 fighter aircraft besides transport and airborne early warning planes as well as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters.

Evidently the new carrier version is still in progress but its low-observable characteristics and modern qualities as a whole would give the PLAN a significant new capacity to match its power-projection objectives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc3RyYXRlZ3kvaGFpbmFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXNlY3VyZXMtY291cnQtYXBwcm92YWwtZm9yLXJlc3RydWN0dXJpbmcvMTQ2MTc5LmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hainan Airlines secures court approval for restructuring | News | Flight Global,"Hainan Airlines Holdings has gained the crucial green light from a local court for its restructuring plan which will see it merge with 11 smaller airlines into a single carrier.

In giving its approval the Hainan High People’s Court ruled on 31 October that restructuring “complies with…the principle of maximising creditors’ interests” and was a “feasible” option.

The airlines approved to merge comprise flagship Hainan Airlines as well as smaller units such as Fuzhou Airlines Lucky Air Air Changan as well as Guangxi Beibu Gulf Airlines.

The merger of the 11 entities into one carrier was first floated in September after a “comprehensive investigation” into parent conglomerate HNA Group and its wide-ranging and often-murky corporate structure.

Restructuring managers found that the connected transactions between the 11 carriers were “complex” and that the creditors were seeking large amounts of claims. Previous reports indicate that the airlines owe close to CNY400 billion ($82 billion) to more than 4900 creditors according to the filing.

Hainan Airlines China’s fourth largest carrier posted a CNY2.56 billion net loss for the three months to 30 September as revenue grew 10% year on year to nearly CNY9 billion.

News of the court approval comes a week after HNA Group creditors voted to greenlight four plans relating to restructuring including Hainan Airlines Holdings’ plan to merge with 10 other sister carriers.

HNA Group received formal notice in late-January that creditors had filed for its bankruptcy on grounds that it was unable to pay off its debts.

The group was already struggling as early as 2018 when it was reported that it was facing a liquidity crunch and mired in debt. The coronavirus outbreak dealt the HNA Group a further blow and by February 2020 it threw in the towel seeking help from the Hainan provincial government.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2FybXlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9hcm15LW5ld3MvMjAyMS9hcm15LW9mLW5pZ2VyaWEtdGFrZXMtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtNjAtdHlwZS04NS10cmFja2VkLWFwYy1hcm1vcmVkLXBlcnNvbm5lbC1jYXJyaWVyLWZyb20tY2hpbmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Army of Nigeria takes delivery of 60 Type 85 tracked APC Armored Personnel Carrier from China,"According to information published by the NNN website on October 28 2021 the Nigerian army has taken delivery of 60 Type 85 also named YW531H a tracked APC (Armored Personnel Carrier) produced by the Chinese company NORINCO.

Since the 2010s China has delivered a large number of military equipment to Nigeria including 15 F-7M Airguard fighter aircraft two P18N OPVs (Offshore Patrol Vessels) 120 AR-1 Anti-Tank Guided Missiles 5 CH-3 drones one type-62 patrol craft 3 SH-2 122mm self-propelled howitzers 2 SH-5 105mm wheeled self-propelled howitzers 6 VT-4 main battle tank 6 ZTL-09 8x8 105mm fire support vehicle four CH-4 armed drones and 2 Wing Loong-2 armed drones.

According to the Ambassador of China to Nigeria Mr Cui Jianchun China would prioritize the implementation of its political and economic cooperation with Nigeria to achieve growth. The two nations established diplomatic relations in February 1971 and today the two countries supported each other to continue a long way internationally.

Given Nigeria’s open and violent conflict in the Niger Delta region specifically it is not surprising to see that China has been acknowledging the need to support more military and peacebuilding efforts in order to protect its investment and interests.

The Type 85 tracked APC (Armored personnel Carrier) was developed in the late 1960s by the State Defense Company NORINCO. The hull of the YW 531 is made of all-welded steel which provides ballistic protection against the firing of small arms and artillery shell splinters. The vehicle has a crew of three and the rear part of the hull is able to accommodate up to 13 infantrymen. The roof of the vehicle is fitted with an open-top turret armed with one 12.7 mm Type 54 machine gun.

The torsion bar suspension on either side consists of five single rubber-tired road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the idler at the rear. The vehicle is fully amphibious being propelled in the water by its tracks at a maximum speed of 6 km/h.

The Type 85 is powered by a BF8L413F 4-cycle turbocharged inter-cooled V-8 diesel engine developing 320 hp at 2500 rpm. The vehicle can run at a maximum road speed of 66 km/h with a maximum cruising range of 500 km."

Cellular antennas enable information flow to provide “an idea of the health of the fleet in our territory” says Jason Ritchey general manager of construction technology firm Sitech a CTE affiliate. “We use software to tell customers how they’re doing — it’s the coolest stuff in the company.” Monitoring also enables customers to anticipate maintenance needs.

CTE also offers drones that can survey construction sites and Caterpillar construction equipment comes with computer equipment to estimate grades and identify barriers. A drone can survey 20 acres in 30 minutes.

It’s a far cry from when Ed Weisiger Sr. ran the company. “We used to check sites for rocks” he says. “We’d pound a hammer.”

Carolina Tractor & Equipment was founded in 1926. In 1930 L.M. Weisiger the Caterpillar distributor for Asheville became the majority investor. During the Depression when many businesses folded CTE sold whatever it could to survive including dairy processing materials and cleaning supplies. As World War II approached increasing construction of roads and airstrips created demand for road building equipment. Later in the 1950s President Dwight Eisenhower oversaw a surge in interstate highway construction.

Ed Weisiger Jr. admires his grandfather L.M. as someone “able to make bets and willing to make pivots and leave comfortable places for uncomfortable places when trends told him he should.”

L.M. Weisiger earned a civil engineering degree from the University of South Carolina at 18 in about 1920. With the dawn of automobiles he became a state highway engineer building roads in western South Carolina. “Then he saw that he could leave the state [job] and become a contractor and then he went from contractor to Caterpillar dealer” says Ed Weisiger Jr. whose hobbies include collecting antique maps and tracing the roads his grandfather built.

Ed Weisiger Sr. was born in Salisbury in 1931. He worked for his dad as a mechanic graduated from N.C. State University in 1954 and joined the Army overseeing a heavy equipment maintenance unit in Germany. He returned to work in 1956 and was named CTE president in 1965.

“My dad bought out Carolina Tractor which gave him three quarters of the state” for Caterpillar Ed Sr. says. “He was smart and very frugal and always made a profit [except for 1934].

I tried to follow that.” Once the headquarters was moved to Charlotte Ed Sr. became active in the chamber of commerce making lots of contacts and sharing in the region’s growth.

“We were fortunate” Ed Sr. says. “Dad took on the dealership in the 1930s. The government spent a lot of money on the Blue Ridge Parkway Eisenhower started the interstate program and Duke built new power plants in the 1950s and 1960s. It helped the area because there was cheap power and businesses came here.”

Ed Sr. took key steps in securing the family’s control of the business buying out four other dealership stockholders in the 1960s. “I felt the stockholders were not participating. They were hangers-on. One lady had about 30%. I had to give her a million dollars.”

The company’s owners now are Ed Sr. and his wife Agnes and Ed Jr. and his three daughters. Today Ed Sr. lives in South Park and has a farm in Lancaster County S.C. where he raises turkeys deer ducks and pine trees.

Born in Charlotte Ed Jr. attended Woodberry Forest School before earning an industrial engineering degree at N.C. State in 1982 and a Harvard MBA in 1985. He worked in commercial real estate before joining CTE in 1986.

Diversifying away from construction equipment sales and service has been a key goal. An example is the partnership formed in 2012 with lift-truck maker Hyster-Yale. “It’s not that we don’t like Caterpillar but we hadn’t been able to grow” he says. “We’ve become less dependent over time.”

Besides CTE the family has two other businesses. Beacon Partners is a Charlotte-based real-estate investment firm founded in 1989 and is led by co-founder Pete Lash.

Beacon oversees about 100 real-estate partnerships valued at more than $2 billion. While much of its focus is on industrial projects Beacon was an early investor in office projects in Charlotte’s red-hot South End area.

The Weisigers also have a private-equity business through a fund that manages $150 million in assets in about 60 companies. “We back searchers young people in their early 30s recent grads of top MBA schools who are trying to do entrepreneurial things” Weisiger says. “We make small and microcap purchases we apply smart people and we grow those businesses. Some are tech-enabled; some are more mundane. One in Washington state delivers garden plants to offices and refreshes them from time to time. Others take care of ponds: they catch stormwater and maintain retention ponds.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3dlbmlzbGFuZHVuZGVyY3VycmVudC5jb20vaW4tdGhlLWNvbW11bml0eS9ldmVyeS1mYWxsLXRoZXNlLXNwaWt5LWhhaXJlZC1pbnNlY3RzLWNyYXdsLXRvLWNvenktaGliZXJuYXRpb24tc2l0ZXMtYW5kLXRoZW4tZnJlZXplLXNvbGlkLTQ3MDYwODfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bowen Nature Club introduces us to the woolybear caterpillar,"The woolly bear caterpillar’s great migration

October is a month of great change. The weather is getting wetter and cooler plants and animals are preparing for winter. In my daily walks through the meadow adjacent to the horse ring in Crippen Park I am seeing the grasses turn from green to brown and the last buttercup and thistle flowers go to seed. Some days I see small flocks of juncos stopping off for a snack of insects and seeds as they make their way south for the winter.

But for me one of the sure signs of autumn is the mass migration of a much smaller creature the banded woolly bear caterpillar. At this time of year they are a little over two and a half centimetres long and are covered with stiff hairs. Their front and rear sections are black with a rusty-red mid section.

Each fall these full-grown caterpillars stop eating the grasses and herbs in the meadow climb down to the ground and begin a determined trek to find cozy hibernation sites.

If you could shrink down to their size and follow one you may have to travel several hundred metres to a dry patch of soil covered by dead leaves and sticks to watch it curl up to sleep until the coming of spring.

Even though the woolly bears seek out insulated hibernation sites these cold-blooded creatures are often exposed to temperatures well below freezing. Their tiny bodies often freeze solid. First their hearts stop then their digestive tract will freeze followed by their blood and then the remainder of their bodies freeze. This would kill most creatures because ice crystals would rip unrepairable holes in their cells. The woolly bears secret is that its tissues are full of cryoprotectant chemicals that protect cell structures from ice damage.

If we get a sunny spell in midwinter when the woolly bears’ hibernation places warm above freezing some will awaken and go out for a short walkabout before finding another cozy hibernation place.

When spring finally comes the woolly bears awaken and again get on the move. This time they are looking for a safe spot among the grass stems to weave a cocoon where they will transform into a pupa.

After two or three weeks the pupa splits its skin and a pretty pale Isabella moth emerges.

After mating with a male the female Isabella moth will lay hundreds of eggs on the leaves of a wide variety of plants in the meadow and surrounding forest.

When they hatch a new generation of woolly bear caterpillars will begin.

Note: scientists have not found woolly bear caterpillars to be pests of food crops or ornamental plants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxL29jdC8zMC9ob3ctdGhlLWRlYXRocy1oZWFkLWhhd2ttb3RoLXRyYW5zbWl0cy10ZXJyb3ItYW5kLWNvbmZ1c2lvbtIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxL29jdC8zMC9ob3ctdGhlLWRlYXRocy1oZWFkLWhhd2ttb3RoLXRyYW5zbWl0cy10ZXJyb3ItYW5kLWNvbmZ1c2lvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the death’s head hawkmoth transmits terror and confusion,"One recent 31 October I jumped from my chair at a sinister squeaking by my bookshelf. I thought it was a mouse but it was the perfect harbinger of Halloween: a death’s head hawkmoth.

The largest moth to fly in Britain is a rare migrant but even in late autumn individuals can be swept across the Channel. “My” hawkmoth had pupated in a plant pot after my children and I reared some of its personable caterpillars.

The death’s head has evoked terror from ancient to recent times (it’s The Silence of the Lambs moth) because above its yellow-and-black striped body is a skull and crossbones pattern.

What we perceive is a world away from other creatures as Philip Howse explains in Bee Tiger an exhilarating new book about this amazing moth. Upside down as seen by birds the “skull” resembles a giant hornet’s head.

This is one of many deceptions. The squeaking bamboozles mice while ultrasonic sounds – emitted from its genitalia – baffle bats. The moth is even covered in waxy particles which act as an invisibility cloak so it can raid honeybee nests with impunity.

As Howse reveals this incredible insect is no outlier: all species communicate in languages that scientists continue to unravel enlarging our perception and sense of wonder too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBqc3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXBlb3JpYS10YXpld2VsbC13b29kZm9yZC1jb3VudHktc2FsZXMtb2N0LTMxLTIwMjEvODU1Nzc0NzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real estate sales in Peoria Tazewell and Woodford counties for Oct. 31 2021,"Journal Star

We respectfully disagree.

The bleeding of horseshoe crabs for biomedical toxicity testing is big business and in defending its use the industry is trying to protect a market valued at more than $500 million.

These companies continue to disparage a modern synthetic testing alternative despite the fact that a major pharmaceutical company is already using it in four marketed products including therapeutics for

COVID-19.

Biomedical horseshoe crab harvest in the U.S. increased 25% in 2019 and total mortality increased 30%.

Research by S.C. Department of Natural Resources scientists has shown that bleeding crabs can lead to the death of 20% of females that are returned to the water.

What’s more continued harvesting of horseshoe crabs has contributed to a 90% collapse of red knot populations and adversely affects other migratory birds and shorebirds that supplement their diets with horseshoe eggs.

If this exploitation continues the red knot that once graced South Carolina shores faces near-certain extinction.

Advocates for a more humane approach to biomedical testing are not “out-of-state environmentalists” as the commentary stated.

South Carolina-based entities including Audubon South Carolina the Coastal Conservation League and the Coastal Expeditions Foundations have all spoken out on this issue.

Pressure on horseshoe crab populations has prevented their recovery from a dramatic crash in the 1990s.

In the U.S. they are now deemed vulnerable and likely to become endangered unless their circumstances improve.

The time for transitioning to an animal-free test is now.

The oil and natural gas company company earned $1.57 per share or $1.58 if non-recurring items are removed. That beat Wall Street expectations by a penny according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

A year earlier it lost $680 million or 15 cents per share.

Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales.

Revenue was $73.79 billion also topping expectations.

Elsewhere in the sector Chevron Corp. reported similar results moving to a strong profit after posting a loss a year ago. The oil company's results also beat analysts' forecasts.

Exxon's oil-equivalent production rose 4% to 3.7 million barrels per day in the third quarter. Production volumes in the Permian Basin averaged about 500000 oil-equivalent barrels per day up approximately 30% from a year earlier.

Oil companies were under pressure during the pandemic to curtail drilling after demand plummeted because so many people were staying home. Prices fell and exploration and production budgets were slashed. That resulted in less oil and gas on the market and in storage which in turn raised prices. But things have started to turn around as people get vaccinated and return to offices and begin to travel.

The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline spiked 13 cents over the past two weeks to $3.44 per gallon. The price at the pump is $1.22 higher than a year ago. Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday the rise comes as the cost of crude oil surges.

The energy sector has far outpaced the broader market in 2021. The S&P 500's energy stocks are up more than 50% compared with a roughly 20% gain for the overall index.

Exxon based in Irving Texas said it's looking into investing in lower-carbon business ventures. Its low-carbon investments are expected to be approximately $15 billion from 2022 through 2027. But the company along with others in the sector have faced growing criticism on climate change.

On Thursday ExxonMobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said that his company ""does not spread disinformation regarding climate change″ as he and other oil company chiefs countered congressional allegations the industry concealed evidence about the dangers of it.

Woods was among top officials at four major oil companies testifying as congressional Democrats investigate what they describe as a decades-long industry-wide campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming.

CHEVRON CORP.

Chevron Corp. on Friday reported third-quarter net income of $6.11 billion after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.

The San Ramon Calif.-based oil company said it had profit of $3.19 per share. Earnings adjusted for non-recurring gains came to $2.96 per share.

Earnings were so strong that the driller's net-debt-to-capital ratio has fallen below its target of 20% to 25% a key threshold that could spur an increase in stock repurchases Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said.

The results exceeded Wall Street expectations but Chevron does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $2.21 per share.

The company posted revenue of $44.71 billion in the period also beating Wall Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $42.47 billion.

Chevron pumped the equivalent of 3.03 million barrels a day during the quarter an increase of 7% from a year earlier aided by the purchase of Noble Energy in October 2020.

PHILLIPS 66

Phillips 66 on Friday reported third-quarter net income of $402 million.

On a per-share basis the Houston-based company said it had profit of 91 cents. Earnings adjusted for non-recurring costs came to $3.18 per share.

The results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.95 per share.

The oil refiner posted revenue of $31.47 billion in the period.

The day of action which took place in at least 100 cities around the world was timed ahead of COP26 the United Nations climate conference beginning in Glasgow on Sunday.

The Bank on Our Future campaign says that stopping the funding of asset managers like BlackRock would help stop the flow of funding for oil and gas.

At least 200 kids left school in a climate strike joined by survivors of wildfires across the state and Indigenous leaders.

ExxonMobil (XOM) America’s largest oil company posted net income of $6.8 billion swinging to a profit after a $680 million loss a year ago. Oil prices got crushed in the early months of the pandemic when countries were still limiting travel and economic activity was at a standstill. But they’ve roared back since surging above $80 a barrel.

Revenue at Exxon soared 60% to $73.8 billion as average crude oil prices rose 72% from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of this year according the the US Energy Information Administration. Oil futures topped $85 a barrel for the first time in seven years earlier this week although prices have retreated slightly since then.

Chevron (CVX) America’s second-largest oil company reported an adjusted profit of $5.7 billion excluding special items its best quarterly result in eight years. The $6.7 billion in free cash flow it generated was a record for the company.

The adjusted profit was not only 34% above the forecasts of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv it was nearly 17 times greater than the $340 million it earned in the year ago period.

Shares of both stocks were up slightly in premarket trading Friday following the reports. Shares of Exxon are up 56% so far this year through Thursday’s close while Chevron shares are up 33%.

But as good as financial results are for the oil companies the industry finds itself under renewed attack for their role in causing climate change. The CEOs of both companies were under fire during testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna urged the CEOs of both companies to follow in the footsteps of their European rivals in planning to cut production to address the climate crisis.

“Are you embarrassed as an American company that your production is going up while European counterparts are going down?” Khanna asked Chevron CEO Michael Wirth.

Wirth responded by pointing out that demand for energy is going up around the world and declined to pledge to reduce oil production.

“With all due respect I’m very proud of our company and what we do” Wirth said.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods similarly declined to commit to reducing production of oil.

“We are committed to lowering our emissions” Woods said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5LXN1bi5jb20vcHJpbnR2ZXJzaW9uL2RldGFpbHMvNTg1MzY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A breath of fresh air for city dwellers,What does IAF’s new doctrine contain & why air force put it out — everything you need to know

Thirty-nine of the country’s top 50 fast-food restaurants received the lowest ranking as “Dining Dawdlers” – including McDonald’s Subway and Chick-fil-A.

The “Moving the Menu” report was produced by World Animal Protection which advocates eating less meat as part of its mission to “change animals’ lives for the better.”

Sofritas at Chipotle. The Impossible Whopper at Burger King. Fresco style at Taco Bell.

Plant-based eaters once limited to wimpy salads minus cheese and often without dressings that contained dairy have increasingly more options at some of the most recognizable U.S. fast-food restaurants amid growing company commitments to diversify protein offerings and cut greenhouse gas emissions created by animal farming.

But for every Starbucks which introduced its Impossible Breakfast Sandwich in 2020 and Pizza Hut which is testing a plant-based pepperoni topping are “Dining Dawdlers” like McDonald’s Subway and Chick-fil-A according to a first-of-its-kind report to be released Monday on World Vegan Day by World Animal Protection.

Cameron Harsh programs director for the nonprofit animal welfare organization described the 24-page report as a guide to help “individual consumers align with the restaurants that share their values” but stressed that “a lot more progress” is needed to reduce the production and consumption of animal proteins for the sake of the climate and general health.

“What the ‘Menu Movers’ in this report have done is not just added plant-based alternatives to their menus and called it good they’ve actually talked publicly … about the benefits of these products” Harsh told USA TODAY.

In its “Moving the Menu” report shared first with USA TODAY World Animal Protection graded the country’s 50 largest fast-food chains on their efforts to vary protein offerings highlight the benefits of plant-based eating in their corporate social responsibility reporting and make public commitments to reduce the use of meat and increase vegan and vegetarian menu options.

Only seven chains were designated as “Menu Movers” the report card’s top ranking: Burger King Chipotle Starbucks KFC Panera Bread Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.

World Animal Protection while not a vegan or vegetarian organization advocates eating less meat as part of its mission to “change animals’ lives for the better” according to its website. One of the group’s primary initiatives is Meating Halfway a 21-day custom plan designed to give individuals and families accessible tools to reduce meat and increase plant-based foods in their diets.

An early trendsetter with sofritas a menu staple since 2014 Chipotle remains focused on pushing more vegetables and plant-based products to the “center of plate” said Stephanie Perdue the company’s vice president of marketing. The Mexican grill is now testing a meatless chorizo – free of gluten soy nuts and grains – at its Denver and Indianapolis locations.

The popularity of sofritas made from shredded tofu flavored with chipotle chiles poblano peppers and a blend of spices has only reinforced Chipotle’s thinking. The company expects to source 4.9 million pounds of organic tofu this year from Hodo Soy Beanery in California up from 4.2 million pounds in 2020.

“We knew that if it’s craveable you wouldn’t miss the meat” Perdue told USA TODAY. “You still get all those layers of flavors.”

Taco Bell which already offers more than 15 items on its “Veggie Cravings” menu is also testing additional plant-based options – including its Cravetarian meatless protein made from a seasoned blend of chickpeas and peas.

“With more than 7000 restaurants nationwide and consumers’ growing sustainability concerns we see the opportunity – and responsibility – to make a positive environmental impact” said Missy Schaaphok Taco Bell's director of global nutrition and sustainability adding that consumers shouldn’t have to “choose between crave-ability and responsible dining.”

Starbucks and Panera meanwhile have highlighted their respective commitments in recent sustainability reports noted by World Animal Protection.

In its 2020 Global Environmental and Social Impact Report Starbucks said “To meet our 2030 goals we set five key strategies rooted in science grounded in Starbucks Mission and Values and informed by comprehensive market research and trials: Expand plant-based menu options.”

While the COVID-19 pandemic delayed plans to test several plant-based dishes Panera said its “long-term aspiration is to have a menu where half of our entrees are plant-based” according to its most recent sustainability report.

Thirty-nine of the top 50 fast-food restaurants however aren’t taking meaningful steps to provide vegans and vegetarians with much more than the ketchup packets next to the napkin dispensers according to the World Animal Protection report.

While McDonald’s began testing its McPlant vegan burger at eight U.S. locations across four states this month the American fast-food icon has lagged behind Burger King long its primary rival. BK launched the Impossible Whopper at its 7000-plus locations more than two years ago and the company has reported U.S. guests who chose the meatless burger in 2020 “avoided the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving about 520 million miles in an average passenger vehicle.”

Subway with nearly 24000 locations – the most of any chain – has yet to provide a plant-based meat option nationally and failed to make a public commitment to expand its menu or reduce meat consumption.

Unlike KFC which has carried out plant-based chicken trials Chick-fil-A hasn’t featured a plant-based alternative on its menu publicly detailed any such plans or recognized the benefits of reducing animal proteins.

The World Animal Protection list of “Dining Dawdlers” also includes Arby’s Dairy Queen Domino’s Dunkin’ Panda Express and Wendy’s.

The message for those straggling chains Harsh said is to recognize the plant-based movement as an “important and necessary direction” for the sustainability of the planet – and for their bottom line.

“To not catch up” he said “is going to be detrimental to their business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvaXRzLWxpa2UtYmVpbmctcmlwcGVkLWludG8tdHdvLWNoaXBvdGxlLXdvcmtlcnMtb3ZlcndoZWxtZWQtYnktb25saW5lLW9yZGVycy1hbmQtZnVyaW91cy1jdXN0b21lcnMtMTE2MzU0MjIxNDnSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9pdHMtbGlrZS1iZWluZy1yaXBwZWQtaW50by10d28tY2hpcG90bGUtd29ya2Vycy1vdmVyd2hlbG1lZC1ieS1vbmxpbmUtb3JkZXJzLWFuZC1mdXJpb3VzLWN1c3RvbWVycy0xMTYzNTQyMjE0OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘It’s like being ripped into two’: Chipotle workers overwhelmed by online orders and furious customers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-like-being-ripped-into-two-chipotle-workers-overwhelmed-by-online-orders-and-furious-customers-11635422149 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvaXRzLWxpa2UtYmVpbmctcmlwcGVkLWludG8tdHdvLWNoaXBvdGxlLXdvcmtlcnMtb3ZlcndoZWxtZWQtYnktb25saW5lLW9yZGVycy1hbmQtZnVyaW91cy1jdXN0b21lcnMtMTE2MzU0MjIxNDnSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9pdHMtbGlrZS1iZWluZy1yaXBwZWQtaW50by10d28tY2hpcG90bGUtd29ya2Vycy1vdmVyd2hlbG1lZC1ieS1vbmxpbmUtb3JkZXJzLWFuZC1mdXJpb3VzLWN1c3RvbWVycy0xMTYzNTQyMjE0OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxseWJpdGUuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC90cmF2ZWwvNjYtZ3VpZGUvNjQwNS10b3AtMTAtYmVzdC1kaWV0LWNoYWluLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Chain Restaurants That Cater To Dietary Needs,Sign up via our free email subscription service to receive notifications when new information is available.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXR0YWNrb2Z0aGVmYW5ib3kuY29tL2d1aWRlcy9yb2Jsb3gteC1jaGlwb3RsZS1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LWEtZnJlZS1idXJyaXRvLWV2ZW50LWRldGFpbHMtc3RhcnQtdGltZS1tb3JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roblox x Chipotle: How to Get a Free Burrito - Event Details Start Time & More,"Recommended Videos

According to Nate Ulrich of the Akron Beacon Journal Chubb was a full practice participant Friday and doesn’t have an injury designation for Sunday’s game.

Chubb was limited at practice Wednesday and Thursday after sitting out the past two games with the calf injury he sustained in Week 5. With Kareem Hunt (calf) still on injured reserve the return of Chubb is a massive boost to the Browns’ rushing game. However D’Ernest Johnson filled in admirably in Week 7 and will continue to serve as Cleveland’s No. 2 back. Johnson recorded 168 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in a breakout game against the Broncos.

When on the field Chubb is one of the best the NFL has to offer

Chubb is a rare player in the modern NFL — and for that matter in fantasy football. With more and more teams utilizing a multiple-back approach runners like Chubb are a rare breed. He has elite-level abilities without requiring utilization in the passing game.

Among running backs who have played in 15 or more games since 2018 Chubb is third in yards (4080) sixth in touchdowns (32) and third in yards per game (83.3). His 5.3 average is third over that time (100 rush minimum). As for fantasy he has finished as the RB16 RB7 and RB9 which is incredible when you factor in his limited usage in the passing game. In 2020 Chubb was the only RB inside the top 36 who had fewer than 20 targets on the season. He was still an RB1 — and he only played in 12 games.

2021 has been no different as Chubb has been a workhorse for the Browns. In five games Chubb has rushed 90 times for 523 yards (5.8 per carry) and 4 touchdowns while catching all 5 of his targets for an additional 35 yards. That’s not only a career-high ypc but also in per-game yardage (104.6).

Chubb was the RB8 in half-PPR scoring prior to his injury (16.1 ppg) and despite missing two weeks he is still No. 16 among running backs.

As he returns to action Chubb is a must-start for fantasy managers in Week 8

Without a doubt there is some trepidation any time you plug a player returning from injury back into your fantasy lineups. That’s all the more true when the player is facing a less than favorable matchup. The Pittsburgh Steelers are a solid defense — they rank seventh in points allowed to RBs (19.42) while their rush defense ranks ninth in Football Outsiders’ DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average).

But this is Chubb we’re talking about. As long as he is in the Browns’ lineup he should be in yours. With Hunt out and Baker Mayfield playing through an injury-riddled left shoulder Chubb could see more than 20 carries something he did in his previous three outings.

The strength of the Steelers’ front seven is negated by the Browns’ offensive line which is one of the best in the NFL especially in run blocking. They are No. 1 in rushing DVOA and No. 2 in Adjusted Line Yards.

Chubb has yet to finish a game in 2021 with fewer than 83 rushing yards and I don’t see that changing this week. He is a locked-in RB1 that fantasy managers should relish having back in their lineups.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vbW90aGVyc2hpcC5zZy8yMDIxLzEwL2Ricy10cmF2ZWxsZXIta2l0LXNwb25zb3JlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travelling this Covid-19 season?

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Wednesday night.

Utah will be home to 30 of the 350 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints once construction is complete on all announced temples. The Deseret News recently spoke to the church’s Utah Area president Elder Kevin W. Pearson to talk about the state and temples after the media open house tour for the Taylorsville Utah Temple.

“Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church” he said in an interview that touched on membership growth and activity and temple covenants and blessings.

Elder Pearson helped lead the media tour which kicked off a public open house that ends on May 18. The Taylorsville Temple will be dedicated on June 2.

Elder Pearson 67 who earned a Harvard MBA and was the CEO of a health care information technology and research company has a broad perspective on the church having served as a General Authority Seventy since 2008 when he was called while serving as president of the Washington Tacoma Mission. He previously served as president of the Pacific Area president of the North America West Area counselor in the Europe East Area presidency and area assistant in the North America Southwest Area.

Deseret News: What is the “State of the Union” for the Utah Area?

Elder Pearson: You’ve got roughly 2.2 million members of the church here. You’ve got some of the most active members in the church here. We have 645 soon to be 650 stakes in Utah. So there’s a tremendous amount of strength in Utah. I’m working with some of the strongest membership of the church.

This is really still where the bench strength is in terms of leadership. Probably still 52-plus percent of all senior couples that serve in the world come out of Utah. About 28-29-30% of all the young missionaries come out of Utah. So Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church. It is a global church to be certain but the church globally is facilitated by the faithfulness of the members of the church.

Now 21 temples operate in Utah of 30 that are announced (for the state). Where do you think that comes from? It comes from the fact that members of the church have been so faithful in keeping the commandments that they have been blessed and prospered. They’ve prospered in the land to use Book of Mormon language and because of that their faithfulness in paying tithings has created extraordinary opportunity now. You think about April 6 1830 and the organization of the church then with six members to where we are today and what it took in terms of sacrifice to build Kirtland (Ohio) and Nauvoo (Illinois) and now the extraordinary abundance that the church has been blessed with is a direct function of the faithfulness of members of the church. It is extraordinary to go from location to location and witness that.

Almost every stake you go to you think ‘This has got to be the most faithful stake on on the earth’ but it’s just over and over and over. Now having said that there are struggles there are challenges for members of the church. The Salt Lake Valley is sort of declining in membership as people move out to the southwest and to Highland and on the other side of the lake and other places. So there are challenges but there are areas where the church is just exploding. We cannot possibly build buildings fast enough. And there are other areas where it’s like ‘OK this used to be an enormously strong area. Now it’s it’s changing.’ So Utah’s very dynamic is the point I’m trying to make. The church is very dynamic in Utah. It’s not monolithic in terms of the experience you have in any given stake or ward but it still continues to be the stronghold of the church. And it’s just a joy to serve here.

Deseret News: During the April general conference many of the talks were about temple covenants about finding stillness about following Jesus Christ’s teachings about the two great laws of loving God and loving others. What did you take away from conference?

Elder Pearson: If members listened carefully with all of these temples being announced and built — there seems to be one open house after another in Utah — I just hope that the members of the church don’t get casual about the extraordinary significance of having a House of the Lord.

We want to make sure that people are less excited about the architecture of a new building and ‘Boy I wonder what the color scheme is in this temple’ and a lot more focused on ‘What promises am I making what are those covenants?’ — the covenants of obedience and sacrifice and chastity and the gospel and consecration. We make very real promises to our Heavenly Father and the Savior and they are absolutely serious about those.

We’re hoping that members of the church will be ever more increasingly serious and focused on their own covenants. What we’re hoping is that these new temples will help members become ever more focused on putting the Savior and their covenants at the very center of their lives and not just having those an aspect of their lives. We hope the increased proximity of temples will help them with that. The proximity we hope will increase significantly the frequency that people get to the temple. The hope is that there will be a transformational mindset that whenever people see or think about the temple they’ll think about the Savior and they’ll think about the sacred promises they’ve made and they’ll be even more determined and committed to keeping them in every aspect of their life. We hope that members will come to cherish and honor those commitments and covenants above any and all other commitments in their lives. I think that’s the essence of the messages you would have heard over the weekend in conference.

We’re going to teach that. We’re going to continue to teach that everywhere we go at President Russell M. Nelson’s behest so that children will grow up knowing what promises are and what they mean and that they’ll be increasing in their capacity commitment and determination to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple and keep them all their lives.

Deseret News: What are the blessings that come from keeping those commitments in that focused way and making them central and making Christ central in one’s life?

Elder Pearson: My wife’s parents would be an example of this. They were Norwegian and they sold everything they had to come to the U.S. so they could be sealed in the temple. The blessing they wanted was an eternal family. First and foremost that is the blessing. For my wife June and I it’s to be sealed together for forever. The blessing is it changes the way we live our lives it changes the way we think about our marriage that we’re in it for the long term. We don’t let short-term roadblocks or bumps in the road upend us. That is a blessing. It shapes the way we live our lives. For many of members of the church in the past they would get to the temple once in their life and that was it but they went for that one blessing and that assurance.

For us in our day and time the blessing of the temple is that you can come and you can you can rise above the noise. You can rise above the lack of civility. You can rise above the disregard for sacred things and you can come to a space where you are literally a guest in the house of the Lord and you can feel more powerfully the influence of the Holy Ghost. You can feel a sense of peace and assurance in your life. Life is not perfect and there are many challenges that people face but they can come here and feel the blessing that because they’ve made covenants with the Savior in the end all will be well.

That is a day-to-day week-to-week month-to-month blessing that people can have in their lives that’s different than coming for the one blessing of being sealed for time and all eternity and never having an opportunity to go to the temple again.

In addition to that the temple is a place of revelation and a place to feel close to the Lord and to get the answers to challenges or questions or difficulties that you’re facing to gather up strength. All of those things are available in the temple. If you’re listening to our prophet in the days to come we are going to need that more than ever before. So I think the blessings available in the temple are constant but they’re also changing in terms of the times in which we live.

That’s something we hope we can help communicate effectively to the members of the church. Now you can come for daily blessings and weekly blessings and not only the singular hope of eternal families.

And sure enough he was in the story.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vY293Ym95c3RhdGVkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMS9sb2NhbHMtb3Bwb3NlZC10by1jb2R5LWxkcy10ZW1wbGUtb3V0cmFnZWQtYXMtY2h1cmNoLXN0YWdlcy1hcmVhLXRvLWJ1aWxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cody Residents Opposed To Gigantic LDS Temple Outraged As Church Stages Area To Build,"The tides of change can already be seen along the skyline of Cody Wyoming.

Instead of a relatively unobstructed view of Cedar and Rattlesnake mountains overlooking the city now anyone looking that way will see a large yellow crane. It’s waiting in eager anticipation to help build a controversial Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple that a group of local residents are trying to stop in Park County District court.

Later this month a final hearing will be held in the lawsuit that was filed by neighbors of the proposed temple site and others trying to block its construction.

The decision made by Johnson County Judge John R. Perry coming out of the May 23 hearing will likely determine if construction of the temple can begin.

In the meantime the church seems ready to start as soon as it’s able with a host of large shipping containers with components of the temple being moved to the temple site off Skyline Drive.

Outrage

Many in Cody expressed outrage on social media this week that not only had the crane been moved to the proposed site but so have modular units for the proposed Cody LDS temple. These storage units contain materials for the 101-foot-tall temple’s construction.

The church announced in a press release this week that because the previous spot the containers were stored is no longer available it had to move them to a site adjacent to where the temple will be built.

As first reported by Cowboy State Daily in 2023 these items were being stored at Y-Tex Corp. a business owned by a member of the church who had donated the land for the temple.

“This new storage location will avoid future crossings of public roads with these modular units during the temple construction” said Jimmie Edwards second counselor for the LDS Cody Wyoming Stake in a press release. “The church is not yet commencing construction of the temple.”

The church owns the temple property and is fully allowed to use the site to keep the containers there.

But many locals say the optics look bad and that it serves as evidence that construction of the temple is inevitable.

Others defend the project saying it’s hypocritical that critics aren’t similarly outraged about two historic buildings that were torn down in the city earlier this year.

Not So?

The nearly 10000-square-foot temple sparked controversy mainly because of the size of the building and its steeple on an almost 5-acre piece of land overlooking Cody. Some living in the neighborhood say the steeple will destroy their viewshed and the temple will have other negative impacts like ruining the night sky and creating more traffic.

The temple dispute is a topic that has dragged on for more than a year in Cody. The issue has riled up the community causing a clear divide between those who support and oppose the project.

Cody resident Dylan Wood who runs youth ministries in town said he’s very disappointed with how some people have been speaking about the temple online particularly those he knows to be of the Christian faith using scripture in what he sees as a distrustful and hateful manner.

“There’s been some really hateful stuff from people who are ‘Christians’ and it really hurts my heart” he said.

Wood said people need to remember the Ten Commandments which state that “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

Although he’s under no illusion that Cody is perfect Wood said many people seem to prefer being upset about something rather than appreciating the positivity in the community around them. Five years down the road after the temple is finished Wood believes the community will have already forgotten about it.

Carla Egelhoff an organizer with Protect Our Cody Neighborhoods (POCN) a group fighting the church in court hasn’t forgotten about the temple yet. Egelhoff said she isn’t personally bothered by the materials being moved to the temple site but has no idea if the church is telling the truth about why it is moving them.

Optimism

Egelhoff said she believes her group’s case is strong. POCN is challenging the decision made by the Cody Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) to allow construction of the temple last August.

“POCN has entered compelling legal arguments based on the Wyoming State Statutes and Cody city ordinances in support of a decision to reverse the PZB decisions and remand the conditional use permit and the site plan back to the City of Cody” Egelhoff said.

If the judge doesn’t rule in POCN’s favor Egelhoff said the group will consider filing an appeal with the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Egelhoff also mentioned how the Cody City Council approved a number of changes as a result of how the temple approval process played out. Most notably this includes more deference to the city’s master plan and notification to landowners in a larger range around a proposed project for a conditional use permit (CUP).

According to the Cody Enterprise  under the new code if 20% or more of the property owners object to a project the PZB can only make a recommendation to the city council which then gets the final decision. In the past only Planning and Zoning Board members had a final say on CUPs.

“The change of number of neighbor notifications and handling of nearby affected property owners input is welcomed at this time” Eglehoff said. “Significant opposition to requests that are outside of current zoning ordinances ought to be addressed by elected officials. More opportunities for citizen participation will be positive for Cody into the future.”

Also when a site plan is under consideration there now must be approval from the majority of the board not just the members present at a meeting which aligns with Wyoming law. This had been a major source of contention at a meeting last summer where a majority of the board members present at a meeting rejected its site plan not the board as a whole.

The First Church of Cannabis is located at 3400 S Rural St. in Indianapolis.

Who founded the First Church of Cannabis?

Levin 68 founder and leader of the First Church of Cannabis is a long-standing marijuana advocate who began working with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) in the late 19990s according to the church's website. He eventually started his own pro-cannabis organization ReLegalize Indiana.

Levin also ran for political positions as a Libertarian in the early 2010s with marijuana legislation as a key focus but came up short. When the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed ""Bill took this as an opportunity to establish The First Church of Cannabis on the basis of 'Cannatarian' religion where love is the most important and including the sacrament cannabis"" according to Church of Cannabis.

Marijuana Church challenges Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act

Levin and the Church of Cannabis filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana Pence and Attorney General Greg Zoeller in July 2015 with the claim that denying them the right to smoke in public infringes on religious freedom. A second lawsuit was filed on March 3 2016 against the city of Indianapolis the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and former Police Chief Rick Hite.

The filed suits argued that members' use of marijuana at the Church of Cannabis should be protected under Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act but was dismissed by the Indiana Court of Appeals in December of 2018.

""I feel sorry for the people who are not educated in this subject matter"" Levin previously said to the IndyStar. ""We'll keep doing what we're doing because we're doing God's work.""

Rais ‘Aam Pengurus Besar Nahdlatul Ulama (PBNU) KH Miftachul Akhyar mengatakan bahwa Maulid Nabi adalah ithlalah ilahiyah sebuah peringatan sebagai bukti mahabbah (cinta) kepada Rasulullah saw. Karena mahabbah itulah ashlun min ushulil iman (pokok-pokok keimanan).



Hal tersebut dikatakan Kiai Miftah dalam acara Maulid Akbar 1443 H dan Haul Ke-39 Syaikh Muhammad Utsman al-Ishaqy di Pesantren Roudlotul Muttaqin Jl Sukun Triwung Lor Kecamatan Kademangan Kota Probolinggo Jawa Timur.



""Tanpa cinta rasul iman kita percuma. Tanpa mahabbaturrasul iman kita ini bisa dikatakan mardud (tertolak)"" kata Rais ‘Aam seperti dalam tayangan Kiai Miftachul Akhyar: Kita Ini Makhluk Proyeksi Akhirat diakses NU Online Ahad (30/10/2021).

Karena itu lanjut ulama kelahiran Surabaya Jawa Timur itu Rasulullah menyatakan Laa yu'minu ahadukum hatta akuna ahabba ilaihi min waladihi wa walidihi wannasi ajma’in (Belumlah iman secara sempurna kalian sehingga aku (kata Rasulullah) lebih dicintai daripada orang tuanya anaknya dan manusia seluruhnya).



Kiai Miftah meneruskan Imam Ibnu Rajab al-Hanbali menyatakan bahwa mahabbaturrasul (cinta Rasul) adalah ashlun min ushulil iman. ""Tadi sudah saya sampaikan bahwa dzikrul anbiya wal mursalin wal ulama wal aulia was-shalihin apalagi dzikru karamatil Aulia itu saja akan mendatangkan kita akan mendapatkan rahmat dan berkahnya kehidupan. Hanya ingat saja memperingati saja itu sudah dapat"" tuturnya.



Kiai Miftah menambahkan apalagi diikuti dengan menindaklanjuti kenapa Rasulullah terpilih menjadi nabi terakhir. Kenapa almaghfurlah Kiai Muhammad Utsman al-Ishaqi terpilih menjadi tokoh ulama panutan dan sebagainya.



""Manqabah-manqabah (manaqib atau sejarah) seperti inilah yang di samping kita kenali lalu kita ikuti. Imam Syaqiq bin Adham pernah menyatakan ada enam perkara penyebab taufik dari Allah ini tertutup. Tapi dari enam ini tidak akan saya ceritakan semua. (Bisa-bisa) sampai subuh nanti. Ya maksimal tigalah"" seloroh Kiai Miftah.



Pertama sibuk dengan anugerah nikmat Allah tapi lupa mensyukurinya. Kita diwujudkan oleh Allah itu merupakan nikmat. Akan tetapi lupa untuk apa kita lahir dan untuk apa kita wujud di dunia. Tugas-tugas kehidupan yang semestinya akan kita bawa ke akhirat justru terlupakan.



""Dan kita ini adalah makhluk proyeksi akhirat bukan makhluk di dunia. Di sini kita hanya mampir lewat"" terang Pengasuh Pesantren Miftsachus Sunnah Surabaya Jawa Timur itu.



Manusia lanjut Kiai Miftah diciptakan untuk sebuah keabadian. Adapun alam arwah sebelum kita bertemu orang tua kita mengadu kasih lalu bertemulah indung telur sama sperma lelaki dan perempuan di alam rahim.



""Setelah di alam rahim keluar di alam dunia ini. Kemudian ada fase demi fase sampai dewasa. Setelah itu pindah ke alam barzah sampai tujuan di alam yang langgeng itu tadi"" terang Kiai Miftah.

Dalam buku Merajut Kembali ke Indonesiaan Kita (2007) oleh Sultan Hamengku Buwono X cinta tanah air adalah cara berpikir bersikap dan berbuat yang menunjukkan kesetiaan kepedulian dan penghargaan terhadap bangsa.

Kita harus mencintai Bangsa Indonesia karena kelak kita sebagai penerus bangsa yang akan memimpin Bangsa Indonesia. Bagaimana kita bisa menjadi pemimpin yang baik dan bertanggung jawab apabila kita tak mencintai rakyat negara ini tak mencintai tanah air ini dan tak mencintai bangsa ini. Oleh sebab itu rasa cinta tanah air harus ditanamkan sejak dini.

Aksi cinta tanah air dapat dilakukan dengan berbagai cara diantaranya menggunakan produk lokal mengharumkan nama Bangsa Indonesia dengan prestasi menggunakan Bahasa Indonesia dengan baik dan benar mempelajari dan melestarikan budaya daerah mempelajari sejarah Bangsa Indonesia dan sebagainya.

Indonesia terdiri dari 17.504 pulau yang membentang dari sabang sampai merauke. Indonesia juga memiliki 1.340 suku dan 2500 bahasa daerah. Karena banyaknya suku inilah menyebabkan lahirnya keanekaragaman budaya dan adat istiadat yang ada di Indonesia. Setiap suku bangsa mempunyai ciri atau karakter tersendiri baik dalam aspek sosial maupun budaya. Budaya dan adat istiadat yang dimiliki oleh setiap suku di Indonesia memiliki ciri khasnya masing-masing.

Bangsa Indonesia memiliki keanekaragaman budaya dan bahasa yang sangat banyak dengan kekhasan yang berbeda di setiap daerahnya. Keanekaragaman budaya Indonesia ini terdiri dari rumah adat upacara adat pakaian tradisional tarian tradisional alat musik tradisional lagu daerah makanan khas daerah dan lain sebagainya.

Kita sebagai generasi penerus bangsa harus melestarikan budaya Indonesia salah satunya dengan cara mempelajari kesenian-kesenian Bangsa Indonesia. Kesenian Bangsa Indonesia ini sangatlah beragam seperti seni tari seni musik seni teater dan lain sebagainya. Kita dapat mempelajari dan melestarikan kesenian tersebut dengan menonton acara pertunjukan seni. Di era modern seperti ini kita dapat menyaksikan pertunjukan seni secara online melalui youtube live streaming dan media yang lain.

Selain itu kita juga dapat mengunjungi museum-museum kesenian seperti museum wayang yang berada di kawasan wisata kota tua DKI Jakarta. Disana. kita dapat melihat berbagai koleksi perwayangan yang ada di Indonesia. Mulai dari wayang kulit wayang golek lukisan wayang koleksi gamelan dan lain sebagainya. Selain museum wayang kita juga bisa mengunjungi Taman Mini Indonesia Indah (TMII) karena di dalamnya juga terdapat koleksi-koleksi kebudayaan Indonesia seperti rumah adat aneka pakaian tradisional tarian serta tradisi daerah. Dengan mengunjungi museum-museum seperti ini dapat menambah pengetahuan dan wawasan kita akan kebudayaan Indonesia sekaligus berekreasi.

Selain menyaksikan pertunjukkan seni dan mengunjungi museum kita juga dapat turut serta dalam melestarikan kebudayaan Indonesia dengan cara mempelajari tarian daerah. Kita dapat mempelajari tarian daerah dengan mengikuti sanggar tari ataupun mempelajarinya melalui youtube. Selain tari daerah kita juga dapat mempelajari lagu-lagu daerah dan bahasa-bahasa daerah. Dengan ini kita dapat turut serta dalam melestarikan budaya kita.

Sebagai generasi muda yang akan memimpin Bangsa Indonesia kita harus menjaga dan melestarikan budaya Indonesia agar tidak tergeser oleh budaya asing. Kita juga harus menjaga persatuan dan kesatuan agar tidak terjadi perpecahan antardaerah yang disebabkan oleh keberagaman suku dan budaya yang ada di Indonesia. Itulah sebabnya kita harus menjunjung tinggi semboyan Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia yaitu Bhinneka Tunggal Ika yang artinya berbeda-beda tetapi tetap satu jua agar kita selalu menghargai dan menghormati budaya lain.

And on Saturday (Oct. 30) he had a chance to return to the concert stage taking part in bandmate Travis Barker's House of Horrors concert special with Avril Lavigne Machine Gun Kelly and more.

Hoppus joined in the fun playing ""What's My Age Again"" ""The Rock Show"" and ""Family Reunion"" with Barker and Escape the Fate's Kevin ""Thrasher"" Gruft.

The special show was put on by digital platform NoCap a venture that was co-founded by Barker's collaborative business partner Cisco Adler the son of producer Lou Adler and co-owner of the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles.

“Cisco and I were talking and we had this idea to do a friends and family show” Barker says. “This is the concert we all WISH we could go to.”

There were performances of some of the most iconic tracks from the artists including Blink-182's ""Rock Show"" and ""What's My Age Again?"" Lavigne also sang some of her classics like ""Sk8ter Boi"" and ""Hey You"" and blackbear performed ""imu"" with a Squid Game-twist. You can watch clips of some of the performances below.

The guest list for the event included Kourtney Kardashian Gabrielle Sidibe Siickbrain Mod Son Phem Royal and The Serpent and Theotis Beasley. It also included opening acts from Jasiah jxdn and Iann Dior along with live interviews from Allison Hagendorf.

The longtime Blink-182 drummer was decked out in half-a-dozen costumes during the performance which was shot days earlier at a reimagined haunted house outside of Los Angeles according to Billboard. Most notably he appeared as the Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in spiked black hair a leather jacket and the iconic ""I'm A Mess"" button.

House of Horrors airs until midnight tonight (Oct. 31) at nocapshows.com. Tickets start at $25.

On this day in 2008 the Philadelphia Phillies celebrated their second World Series championship in franchise history with a parade on Broad Street.

Before the parade arrived at its final destination of Citizens Bank Park it began on 20th and Market Streets. The parade route then went toward City Hall and then turned south on Broad St.

Left fielder Pat Burrell's dog Elvis led one of the parade floats. The team waved to their fans and one could truly feel the love between the team and their loyal fanbase.

When the parade got to the Bank there was a ceremony for the team where they drove around in cars at the warning track and then came together on stage for speeches.

The most famous speech came from second baseman Chase Utley who blurted out an expletive on live television which prompted t-shirts with the saying. It became an infamous moment in Phillies history.

Throngs of fans crowded the streets and packed the Bank to celebrate the team's World Championship. It was a momentous Halloween for everyone that attended the parade and was watching on television from home.

Here's to hoping we get to do another one of championship parades again soon.

And to a lesser extent in 1972 a seven-player trade took place which sent Phillies' Don Money Bill Champion and John Vukovich to the Brewers in exchange for Ken Brett Jim Lonborg Ken Sanders and Earl Stephenson.

Vukovich eventually returned to Philadelphia in 1979 and retired as a Phillie in 1981. He later served as a manager and coach for the Phillies. The team wore a patch in memoriam of Vukovich also known as 'Vuk' following his death in 2007.

On Nov. 1 we reported our first-quarter earnings results.

We delivered solid results fueled by higher demand for our products than our previous assumptions in the face of a volatile and challenging environment including significantly high input and transportation costs that continued to pressure our margins.

Sales in the first quarter fell 6% compared to 27% growth this time last year or an increase of 21% on a two-year stack basis. Adjusted EPS declined 54% compared to an increase of 65% in the year-ago quarter.

Although the environment remains challenging with ongoing elevated cost pressures our first-quarter performance along with our action plans keep us on track to meet our fiscal 2022 outlook. We’re laser-focused on rebuilding our margins and growing market share and made meaningful progress in the first quarter.

We restored supply in the vast majority of our businesses and continued to focus on building supply chain resiliency and flexibility.

We grew or held share across most of our businesses with double-digit increases for Clorox® disinfecting wipes and Brita® water filters driven by supply improvements and strong demand-building plans.

We drove productivity improvements and took pricing actions to mitigate inflationary headwinds including announcing pricing on 50% of our portfolio most of which will be in effect in November 2021. We’re also taking additional pricing through the balance of our fiscal year which will lead to price increases on about 70% of our portfolio.

We launched new innovations that deliver superior consumer value including Fresh Step® Outstretch new Kingsford® Signature Flavor pellets and Neocell® collagen powders and gummies.

We also achieved an important ESG milestone with the approval of science-based targets that reaffirm our commitment to climate action and put us a path to our target of net zero emissions across our value chain (scopes 1 2 and 3) by 2050.

Clearly the cost environment is a lot tougher than we assumed back in August. Consumer demand remains difficult to predict as the pandemic evolves and supply chain disruptions continue to be challenging. However based on the actions we’ve taken we’re facing these headwinds from a position of strength.

Strong investments behind our global portfolio have helped us deliver superior value to our consumers which is evident in continued strength in household penetration consumer loyalty and improved elasticities – all of which support our efforts to rebuild profitable growth over time.

Accelerating our performance and long-term shareholder value is at the core of our IGNITE strategy. I’m confident that our continued strong focus on execution of our strategic choices will deliver profitable growth over time.

Finally big thanks to my Clorox teammates around the world for their passion and dedication to serving our consumers and communities around the world. Together we are living up to our purpose and championing people to be well and thrive every single day.

Ko will also compete in the Aramco Team Series Jeddah which is the final leg of the Saudi-backed series which included events in London Sotogrande and New York.

The Jeddah event will be held opposite the LPGA’s Pelican Women’s Championship which is the penultimate event of the LPGA Tour season.

The final event will be the CME Group Tour Championship however Ko will be out of the running for the Vare Trophy.

The Vare Trophy is awarded to the player with the lowest scoring average of the season but players must complete 70 rounds to qualify for this.

""This will be my first visit to the Kingdom"" said Ko who has never won the Vare Trophy.

""Having watched some of last year’s debut Saudi events the Aramco Team Series tournaments this year and having heard only good things from the girls on Tour the Aramco Saudi Ladies International presented by PIF is an event I am really excited to be part of.

""Being able to play in different countries around the world and inspire more young people and young girls especially into golf is something that I never take for granted.

""I know the impact this event had with Saudi girls last year - with more than 1000 signing up to learn to play - so it sounds like I’ll be playing in somewhere that’s really starting to fall in love with golf.""

Players such as Anna Nordqvist Minjee Lee Georgia Hall and Laura Davies will also be competing in Saudi Arabia.

Both of the events in the Middle East will feature prize purses of $1 million. Last year was when the first-ever women's event was held in Saudi Arabia.

These LET-sanctioned events are backed by the Private Investment Fund who represent the Saudi Arabian government.

The PIF are the same group that is behind Liv Golf Enterprises which are at the helm of the new proposed golf series with Greg Norman as its commissioner.",,,,,,,,,

Coke which already owns 30% of BodyArmor is buying the remaining 70% from the company’s founders and investors as well as a group of professional athletes including the NBA’s James Harden and MLB’s Mike Trout who invested and helped market the drink.

The estate of Kobe Bryant an early backer of BodyArmor stands to collect more than $400 million for its stake some of the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Bryant invested $6 million and had served on the BodyArmor board before he died in 2020 these people said.

COCA-COLA TIRES ON ENERGY DRINK AND WILL STOP SALES IN NORTH AMERICA

Gatorade still dominates the sports drink market though BodyArmor sales have been climbing quickly. BodyArmor expects to generate about $1.4 billion in retail sales this year according to some of the people familiar with the matter. BodyArmor’s sales were about $250 million in 2018 when Coke first invested in the startup.

Earlier this year Coke disclosed that it was in talks to take a controlling stake in BodyArmor. The transaction is expected to be announced as soon as Monday the people said. Beverage Digest earlier reported that the valuation could top $7 billion and Bloomberg News reported that Coke was nearing a deal for a controlling stake.

Gatorade which is owned by PepsiCo Inc. accounts for the lion’s share of the $8.4 billion spent on sports drinks in the past year in U.S. retail stores tracked by Nielsen according to Goldman Sachs analyst Bonnie Herzog. Gatorade represented 64% of those sales in the four weeks ended Oct. 9. Coke’s Powerade which represented 13% has failed to make a dent in its rival. BodyArmor has now taken the No. 2 spot with 18% of the market according to Ms. Herzog.

COCA-COLA PAUSES AGGRESSIVE DIVERSITY PLAN AFTER CHIEF LAWYER RESIGNS

The BodyArmor transaction would be the largest brand acquisition in Coke’s history eclipsing the $5.1 billion paid in 2018 for Costa Coffee a foray into the coffee shop business. Chief Executive James Quincey has been pushing the company to become a ""total beverage company."" In addition to expanding its coffee and sports drinks offerings Coke recently introduced an alcoholic version of its Topo Chico sparkling water.

Another large Coke acquisition was its $4.1 billion purchase in 2007 of Glaceau the company behind the Vitaminwater and Smartwater brands. Michael Repole the co-founder and principal investor in BodyArmor also helped create and sell Glaceau to Coke.

BodyArmor based in Queens N.Y. was launched in 2011 by Mr. Repole’s co-founder Lance Collins an entrepreneur behind successful brands including Fuze tea and Core bottled water. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. has a 12.5% stake in BodyArmor.

BodyArmor’s products include sports drinks alkaline water and caffeinated sports drinks. None of them contain artificial sweeteners colors or flavors the company has said. The brand has marketed its offerings as healthier alternatives and enlisted younger athletes such as Mr. Trout and Mr. Harden to invest and appear in its ads.

Coke bought a 15% stake in BodyArmor in 2018 for $300 million at a $2 billion valuation the people familiar with the matter said.

After 17 years with the national team two World Cup titles two Olympic gold medals two FIFA Player of the Year awards and the third-most goals on the USWNT’s all-time list Lloyd is leaving the game as a legend and entering the next phase of her life.

On Tuesday night in front of 18115 fans at Allianz Field in Saint Paul Minn. Lloyd gave us one more show. Taking the field against Korea Republic with a lineup full of younger players the 39-year-old forward created several scoring opportunities in front of net before subbing off in the 66th minute and officially passing the torch.

Bri Lewerke was on the scene Tuesday for Just Women’s Sports to capture Lloyd’s sendoff during the USWNT’s 6-0 win.

Lloyd one of the most clutch scorers in national team history celebrated two first-half goals with her teammates. The first came in the ninth minute from Lindsey Horan who will wear Lloyd’s No. 10 into the next chapter for the USWNT.

Before she left the field to make way for Alex Morgan Lloyd peeled off her jersey to reveal one underneath. On the back of the second No. 10 jersey was her married name Hollins.

Lloyd’s husband Brian Hollins was in the stands Tuesday along with her mother father and a large group of family and friends.

At the end of the game USWNT players and staff gathered around Lloyd at midfield for a video tribute and final remarks.

Addressing the crowd in Minnesota Lloyd thanked everyone who has played a role in her long and storied career bid farewell to the sport and delivered a parting message.

With concerns about public safety village officials removed the foot bridge that has provided a passage way for pedestrians to travel between Bicentennial Park in the 300 block of Murray Avenue and Veterans Park.

More:Minerva High School Athletic Hall of Fame induction ceremony set for Oct. 2

The bridge sat over Sandy Creek in the southeast section of Minerva. Bicentennial Park is on the east side of Sandy Creek while Veterans Park is on the west side.

The bridge is with Minerva Welding & Fabricating where a new deck is being installed. Instead of wood the new deck will be metal.

""This will have a metal surface"" village Administrator Philip Turske said. ""It will withstand the elements better. They will be removing the wood flooring. It was expected to be out eight to 10 weeks. Right before Thanksgiving is when they were to put it back.""

The contract price is $34442. Th project does not to involve the bridge railing.

""I think the structure itself was solid"" Village Councilman Nathan Meadows said. ""The wood that you walk on was no longer safe. The wood was starting to deteriorate. At some point it was not going to be safe for people to cross.""

Village officials say Bicentennial Park attracts a fair share of visitors. In the park are facilities for disc golf sand volleyball along with tennis and basketball courts. And there is a walking trail.

Veterans Park contains military equipment such as a tank and cannon.

""We are cognizant that a lot of people use that bridge"" Turske said. ""Obviously we didn't want that bridge to fall down. For an active community like Minerva it fully allows people to cross over (the creek) to two of the village parks.""

Where the bridge sat are now two bare abutment areas.

""The bridge is about 65 feet long and five feet wide"" said Michael Gasper an official with Minerva Welding & Fabricating. ""We brought it over here sandblasted it repainted it. Now we have to put the grating down. It was just rotting and a safety issue. It might have been 25 years old I would say.""

Along with accommodating those engaging in park activities bridge provides a shortcut for those who want to travel to and from the southeast section of the village to the downtown area.

""It gives them a nice detraction from the traffic"" Meadows said. ""It is a little inconvenient that is is not there. Once we get it back in place it will keep people happy. That is our busy park.""

Aliyah Boston’s putback was inches away from going in. An absolute heartbreaker for South Carolina. 💔

Even though her first two seasons at South Carolina as the centerpiece of 2019’s top recruiting class were significantly thwarted by Covid-19 Boston’s production on the court has been a steadying force. Now entering her junior year the 6’5” forward is averaging 13.1 points 10.4 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game through her college career having led the nation in rebounds last season when she was named the best center in the country for the second year in a row.

Head Coach Dawn Staley coming off a gold medal summer with USA Basketball is no doubt looking forward to seeing what Boston can do as a junior. But she also has ten other reasons to feel optimistic about the 2021-22 season. All of Boston’s ten teammates from last season’s Final Four including starters Destanni Henderson Zia Cooke Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton are back on campus now with invaluable Final Four experience under their belts.

As if a sequel with the entire starring cast isn’t enough Staley has once again demonstrated her keen ability to connect with the elite youngsters of the game and will be adding the top 2021 recruiting class to her squad this season.

Incoming freshmen Raven Johnson Saniya Rivers and Sania Feagin are ranked two three and four in the nation for their class and will be joined by the fourteenth overall prospect Bree Hall. Whether senior point guard Henderson will have a season to take newbie Johnson under her wing or the freshman works her way past Henderson into the starting role the Gamecocks are in strong hands with those two options at the helm. Don’t be surprised if Rivers 2021’s Gatorade National Player of the Year also earns a starting spot by year’s end.

Dawn Staley said she asked each player to give her a ""selfish"" goal they had for the season.



She says one of the freshmen told her -- ""I just wanna win a national championship. I don't even know about those other awards they're talking about."" — Augusta Stone (@augustalstone) October 27 2021

The four freshmen aren’t the only newcomers coming to campus in Columbia this fall. While some see the transfer portal as a fickle two-headed monster the portal gods shined on Staley this off-season when things fell apart at Syracuse and she signed Kamilla Cardoso a 6’7” transfer who earned ACC Freshman of the year and ACC co-Defensive Player of the Year last season while playing for the Orange.

Clearly things look exceptionally good on paper for Staley and her team. But a loaded roster in October is miles and mountains away from a National Championship in April. Being ranked No. 1 in the AP’s preseason poll is nice but it won’t mean anything if the season ends in heartbreak once again.

Luckily for South Carolina Staley isn’t the type of coach to put her cart before the horse as she endeavors to bring a second national title home for the Gamecocks.

South Carolina begins their season with an exhibition game against Benedict Monday Nov. 1st. The Gamecocks’ first regular season game is against No. 5 NC State on Tuesday Nov. 9th.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L3NtZS1zZWN0b3IvdGhlLW5lZWQtZm9yLWlubm92YXRpdmUtY3NyLW1vZGVscy1pbi1wb3N0LXBhbmRlbWljLXdvcmxkL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg3MzkwMzc4LmNtc9IBhwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L3NtZS1zZWN0b3IvdGhlLW5lZWQtZm9yLWlubm92YXRpdmUtY3NyLW1vZGVscy1pbi1wb3N0LXBhbmRlbWljLXdvcmxkL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NzM5MDM3OC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The need for innovative CSR models in post-pandemic world,The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on communities across India as it disrupted the socio-economic landscape of the country. It also wiped out several years of developmental gains made in the last decade with respect to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.According to Edelman ’s Annual Trust Barometer 78% of Indians sampled (global average at 62%) believe that inequities have worsened and those with less education money and fewer resources have been disproportionately burdened as a consequence of the pandemic. The definition of corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) has to evolve and the role of corporate philanthropy must assume greater importance.In India the law mandates that businesses with a turnover of more than Rs 1000 crore net worth of Rs 500 crores net profit of Rs 5 crore or more must spend at least 2% of the average net profits earned during three preceding financial years to CSR activities. This calculation based on India’s pre-pandemic challenges might no longer be enough. When the Covid-19 crisis hit India the government imposed a nationwide lockdown requiring all non-essential services including businesses to close their physical operations.Almost 32 million people in India were driven into poverty by the pandemic last year based on a study by the Pew Research Center accounting for a majority of the 54 million who slipped out of the middle class worldwide. Covid-19 also undid 70 years of girls education and women’s development progress by widening the gender gap. With such social distresses the increased urgency to solve “foundational” problems such as education healthcare climate change and addressing poverty and inequality was felt harshly.The pandemic also highlighted the importance of bringing together different stakeholders to work collaboratively with the government to support communities in need. The world is witnessing an increased expectation that businesses will step in with their expertise and resources to solve societal problems and not only “doing business as usual”. Corporates must support India and the communities in need with their core expertise and assets which go beyond just funding.Since the pandemic many companies have offered innovative social solutions in response to the crisis. For example Reliance Industries tweaked their Jamnanagar oil refinery plant to become a supplier of medical oxygen which was supplied for free to badly hit states in India. Alcohol companies like Radio Khaitan that makes Magic Moments Vodka marshalled their factories to produce sanitizers. Amazon too leveraged their global and local logistics capabilities to not only donate critical medical equipment but also facilitated the airlift of thousands of oxygen equipment from across the globe and delivered them to the remotest corners of the country. Innovative corporate models of philanthropy truly aided India’s fight against the two waves of Covid-19. Even apart from emergency scenarios like Covid-19 companies have a lot to offer to underserved populations in India. For instance technology companies such as CISCO and AWS have been supporting digital education and skilling in many corners of India.India’s public policy stance has also witnessed a change with the government now focused on reviving the livelihood economy in contrast to the pre-pandemic strategy focused solely on growth. The government is embracing the Public-Private-Philanthropic partnership models to ensure efficient welfare delivery. The expertise and capital that corporates bring in while partnering with the government to solve social issues adjacent to their businesses create a perfect symbiosis. Be it in education and skilling ( Microsoft IBM  CISCO) sustainability (HUL P&G) poverty reduction healthcare or women empowerment amongst others; PPP models have proven to be more effective especially with large businesses leveraging their scale and resources to support employees and communities in India amid the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.A narrow legislative definition of CSR doesn’t hold water anymore as newer and innovative measures might not always fit into the 2% slab. The time has come for us to formalise a critical element of CSR that involves service and in-kind delivery of social good and white spots in socio-economic research.For instance Maruti Suzuki India Ltd as part of its CSR has partnered with Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) to train skilled workers some of whom it even hires. Amazon as well has spent crores in carrying out global and local logistical tasks during Mission Vayu in 2021.Similarly there are many areas which remain hidden in plain sight. The informal sector and MSMEs are the case in point. The pandemic devastated lives and livelihood of millions of self-employed people but there is no data and hardly any quantitative and qualitative analysis of the damage done. It is impossible to gauge the destruction let alone organize support in the absence of critical data sets. The Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for MSMEs therefore targeted only formal enterprises which had running loans at a given date; all the informal enterprises- over 90% of the total sector had to fend for themselves. Research activities covering the MSMEs and the informal sector ought to be covered under CSR.We must be cognizant of the fact that company profits have also been hit as various industries tackled economic headwinds and in these times the CSR activities are needed the most.The pandemic has ascertained the spontaneity of calamities and how within a matter of days the world can drop to its knees. Socially beneficial corporate activities are investments in the progress of a society. Private philanthropic entities using the tools of collaboration communication and knowledge sharing can redefine the development map of India and accelerate the pace of development like never before.(The writer is Secretary General Federation of Indian Micro Small & Medium Enterprises)

Scientists say incinerated plastic is a dangerous new ingredient to add to the mix as it releases harmful substances like dioxins and furans when burned.

According to Paul Connett a retired professor of environmental chemistry and toxicology at St. Lawrence University in Canton New York if enough of those pollutants escape from a cement kiln they can be hazardous for humans and animals in the surrounding area.

Single-use shopping bags take-out containers and discarded bubble wrap have become one of the fastest-growing sources of energy for the world’s cement industry.

Multinationals behind the Indonesian project to burn more plastic waste in cement kilns include The Coca-Cola Company Unilever Nestle S.A. and Colgate-Palmolive Company.

Also joining the deal are four top cement producers: Switzerland’s Holcim Group Mexico’s Cemex SAB de CV PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia Tbk (SBI) and the Philippines' Republic Cement & Building Material Inc.

These companies contend that converting plastic to energy would kep the trash out of landfills and oceans while allowing cement plants to move away from burning coal a major contributor to global warming.

The cement industry is the source of 7 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions.

Meanwhile consumer brand manufacturers are impacted by moves to ban or tax single-use plastic packaging and make them bear the costs of its clean-up.

Axel Pieters chief executive of Geocycle the waste-management arm of Holcim Group insists that burning plastic in cement kilns is a safe inexpensive and practical solution that can dispose of huge volumes of this trash quickly.

The cement firms said their partnerships with consumer goods companies were addressing the global waste crisis and reducing their use of traditional fossil fuels.

The United Nations Environment Program estimates that figure to be 300 million tons annually.

The world’s plastic recycling capacity is estimated to be 46 million tons a year according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That is way below the 300 million tons annually that the world currently produces.

A study published last year by the Pew Charitable Trusts also warned that plastic garbage flowing into the oceans is due to triple to 29 million tons a year by 2040. This is detrimental to wildlife and could contaminate seafood.

Pieters claims the cement industry can burn all the plastic waste.",,,,,,,,,

Sky is one of the main sponsors of the Cop26 climate conference and as part of an attempt to nudge the general public into taking action against global heating the broadcaster said television dramas should feature more characters buying electric cars or ordering vegetarian options in restaurants.

However it has emerged that Sky’s chief executive Dana Strong who was appointed in January was making long-distance trips every few weeks on a private jet from her old base in Philadelphia until she moved to the UK in June according to the Telegraph.

Strong lived close to the headquarters of Sky’s parent company Comcast which owns a fleet of corporate aircraft. A spokesperson for Sky defended the private jet commute to the publication saying: “Many CEOs leading multinational companies have schedules that mean it is appropriate to use different modes of transport.”

They added: “It is critical to counterbalance this that is why we offset carbon emissions caused by the business travel of Sky employees.”

Sky said the company had reduced its carbon footprint by 23% since 2018 and Strong’s travel arrangements were affected by the pandemic as she was unable to move her family to the UK in her first six months as CEO. “During this time she balanced visiting her family when her schedule allowed with running the business” it said.

The chief executive’s regular use of a private jet is embarrassing for the company given that Strong will present guidelines on how the television industry can help change the public’s behaviour on green issues at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow.

Sky hired the behavioural insights team originally founded as the government’s “nudge unit” to develop suggestions on how the television industry could help change the public’s behaviour using small encouragements.

Their conclusions shared with the Guardian and which are due to be unveiled by Strong on Monday propose a series of incidental tweaks to television output – whether it is drama children’s programming or news bulletins – to change the public’s actions.

Ironically one of the report’s findings is that “such activities will be perceived as more legitimate if broadcasters are seen to lead by example”.

The behavioural insights team concluded that viewers were put off “fear-mongering guilt-tripping blaming or preaching” and often felt overwhelmed and unable to do anything to help the environment. As a result they recommend television producers put successful individual human actions at the centre of programmes such as people choosing to take fewer flights.

Sky’s guidelines also propose using trusted news presenters to emphasise the importance of the climate crisis having a consistent message about the need for action on the environment and using the power of large television audiences to put pressure on politicians to act.

Some climate activists disagree over whether small changes by large numbers of individuals are enough to halt the onset of global heating. Many are instead emphasising the role played by a small number of enormous corporations and governments in polluting the world.

However the behavioural insights team said over-emphasising looming devastation without offering hope to the public risked “alienating the audience” and causing people to nihilistically double down on existing behaviour.

They also warn that clumsy forced environmental storylines can turn off audiences if they make programmes boring and that the public will not trust television companies that do not also cut their own emissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL2J5cm9uLWFsbGVucy1tZWRpYS1lbXBpcmUtaGFzLWV2ZXJ5dGhpbmctcmlkaW5nLW9uLWFuLThiLXR2LWJldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Byron Allen's media empire has everything riding on an $8B TV bet,"Byron Allen the 1980s comedian-turned-media-mogul who owns the Weather Channel is angling to buy a massive chain of TV stations that were formerly owned by the Gannett newspaper giant — and the outcome could make or break his budding business empire according to some insiders.

Allen — who made headlines last year when he took a racial-discrimination case against Comcast to the Supreme Court losing the case but nevertheless wringing concessions from the cable giant for his fledgling TV networks — is now eyeing an $8 billion deal to acquire Tegna a chain of 64 TV and radio stations that span more than 50 markets across the US.

Allen’s motives may have become clearer last week when Fox launched a 24-hour streaming weather app that media insiders say looks like the basis for a new cable-TV channel. Fox Weather will likely have significant leverage as it eyes a rollout given the clout of Fox’s news and sports channels — and the Weather Channel is in its crosshairs sources said.

Fox’s app which touts free always-on video streaming and 3-D radar will be broadcast from a newly renovated studio at its Midtown headquarters and can also take content from local Fox stations around the US. “Fox’s network of dual-polarity Doppler radars helicopters reporters and news crews around the world lets us show you weather in a way you’ve never seen before” according to its Web site — illustrating what the incumbent Weather Channel and Allen are up against.

Fox which shares a common owner with News Corp. the publisher of The Post declined to comment.

If 60-year-old Allen — whose Allen Media Group thus has amassed 33 local TV network affiliate stations — gets his hands on Tegna’s 64 stations his bargaining position with cable giants could get a major boost. Allen also could gain leverage to sell cable companies his other nine fledgling networks including Pets.TV Comedy.TV Recipe.TV and Cars.TV.

One problem: Allen is bidding for Tegna’s TV stations against the hedge fund Standard General whose CEO Soo Kim owns the Bally’s casino empire and is teaming up in his bid with Apollo Global Management the deep-pocketed private-equity giant. They have already submitted a fully financed offer of $22 a share for Tegna according to multiple sources. Tegna shares on Friday closed at $19.66.

That offer comes with its own issues — and could create an opening for Allen. Standard General earlier this year launched an unsuccessful proxy contest to oust Tegna Chief Executive David Lougee pointing to allegations of discrimination and racial bias against Tegna which Lougee denied. The Standard General-Apollo team would push out Tegna’s current management; Allen would keep them according to sources familiar.

Nevertheless sources said Allen may face an even bigger problem himself which is that the Weather Channel’s business took a major hit during the pandemic. As TV advertising dried up Allen Media’s earnings fell from about $185 million to $130 million before it closed in August on an acquisition of 10 stations from Gray Television — giving it a modest boost according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.

As a result Allen Media’s debt in recent months has climbed to more than seven times its ebitda a closely watched measure of profitability sources close to the situation said. That’s getting close to a red line where Allen Media could break its debt covenant — and makes it harder for him to secure financing for an ambitious acquisition the person familiar with the company’s finances said.

Allen — who got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last week — already in recent years has tried to make a transformative acquisition and failed. In 2018 he wanted to participate in the $4 billion auction for Tribune’s television stations and could not line up co-investors.

Last week Allen was reportedly talking to Oaktree Capital Management Fortress Investment Group and Ares Management about partnering on a last-minute bid for Tegna sources said.

A sticking point for Allen is that his co-investors want a big stake in Tegna because they’d be putting up most of the equity. Allen wants to maintain almost complete control sources following the situation said.

“I think he will cave” a source close to the situation said.

Allen made some lenders skittish after an audit they conducted this summer showed he’d drawn a hefty compensation package from his company which had recent annual revenue of around $600 million even as business was declining sources said. Allen paid himself a total compensation package of $50 million in 2020 according to sources familiar.

Flagging Allen’s compensation lenders charged him $40 million to allow him to borrow more money to finance Allen Media’s roughly $1.5 billion in debt according to sources familiar with the matter. Allen Media is paying a blended interest rate of around 7 percent sources said. If it weren’t for the spending concerns he would’ve been charged less than $40 million sources said.

Meanwhile Bloomberg reported that Allen recently borrowed $83 million to expand his Beverly Hills Calif. estate. Since 2018 he has bought a lavish apartment on Central Park South for $27 million a sprawling chalet in Aspen Colo. for $27 million and another estate on the Hawaiian island of Maui for $23 million.

If Allen doesn’t close the deal for Tegna his mini-media empire could find itself on shaky ground under the weight of excessive debt sources said. The Weather Channel Network earns less than 15 cents a month per cable subscriber and makes most of its money from advertising according to a person familiar with the situation. (Allen Media operates the Weather Channel television network and its streaming service. But IBM owns the Weather Channel brand as well as the site weather.com and the Weather Channel App.)

Still Allen Media did well in the September “upfronts” where media companies sell airtime to advertisers according to a source familiar with the circumstances.

But in addition to rival bidders Allen faces uncertainty from Tegna itself which has said only that it’s exploring a possible sale. Tegna which had two sale processes in recent years that did not result in a sale said last Wednesday it is reviewing its “options to create and return value to shareholders.”

Allen and Tegna both declined to comment to The Post.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL215ZWRtb25kc25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvYS10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGl2ZS1leHBlcmllbmNlLWVkbW9uZHMtd29tYW4tcmVjYWxscy1uYXRpdmUtYW1lcmljYW4tY2Fub2Utam91cm5leS10aHJvdWdoLXRoZS1zYWxpc2gtc2VhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'A transformative experience': Edmonds woman recalls Native American canoe journey through Salish Sea,"Paddling a traditional Coast Salish open canoe through 144 miles of the Salish Sea is not an adventure everyone would savor.

“We had several 4 a.m. wakeup calls and on some days we paddled for eight or nine hours” explained Edmonds’ Diana White as she recalled her experiences this past August taking part in the Healing Waters Canoe Journey. “I paddled every day and my best one-word description for the experience is ‘transformative.’ It changed me opened my eyes and mind to new things. I came back different than when I left.”

The 2021 Healing Waters Canoe Journey was an outgrowth of a tradition begun in 1989 as part of the Washington State Centennial Celebration. Organized by the late Emmett Oliver the 1989 event ensured a place for Washington State’s First Peoples in the festivities. Oliver was a citizen of the Quinault Nation a retired U.S. Coast Guard Officer educator and advocate who served as a member of the committee that planned the State of Washington’s centennial celebration (read more about Oliver here). This return of Indigenous canoes to an Indigenous place—Seattle a city named for the 1800s leader of the Duwamish and Suquamish peoples—gave birth to the annual Canoe Journey and a cultural renaissance involving multiple generations from a growing number of Indigenous nations.

As the primary means of travel between coastal communities throughout the Puget Sound the living canoes have held a vital place for the Coast Salish people as vehicles of welcome and conflict fishing and trade and a deep-rooted cultural tradition passed down throughout generations.

“The original Paddle to Seattle consisted of only about 10 canoes” explained White. “But in later years it grew to more than 100 ocean-going canoes. It was a real mix; some were connected with specific tribes some with several tribes and some had non-native participants. The journeys quickly became a place for native people to reconnect rediscover and share their culture among themselves and with others.”

While the larger annual tradition was suspended in 2020 and 2021 (and will likely be suspended in 2022) due to COVID some smaller-scale journeys were organized to help keep the tradition alive.

One of these was the Healing Waters Journey a two-week paddle tracing 144 miles of traditional Salish Sea canoe routes. Organized by the Blue Heron Canoe Family a partnership with the then-Edmonds Community College Anthropology Department the journey honors traditions and celebrates ancestral knowledge and canoe culture providing a pathway for youth to learn internalize and reclaim this cultural identity. The Blue Heron Family has been participating in canoe journeys since its formation more than a decade ago.

“Canoe families can comprise a mixture of tribes races ages and genders” explained Blue Heron Family member White. “My tribe is from the Midwest. But you do need to be invited to join.”

An enrolled member of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Indians and also of Cherokee descent White notes that her grandparents met at an Indian boarding school in Oklahoma. In addition to her strong Native American heritage the other side of White’s family tree includes some of the original Dutch pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower.

The Healing Waters Journey began on Aug. 2 2021 in Edmonds where Blue Heron family members including family patriarch Mike Evans were joined by the community for a ceremony of dancing songs stories and more as they launched their canoes and set off for what would be a shared experience of culture spiritual renewal bonding and more. (See My Edmonds News full coverage of the departure ceremony here.) Two canoes the Blue Heron and the Willipa Spirit took part.

The two-week journey took the Blue Heron Family along a traditional route stopping at Native reservation lands state parks and beaches on Camano Island Fidalgo Island and the San Juans. This included paddling through some 3-foot to 4-foot seas across Rosario Strait as well as the more protected waters of Skagit Bay and the San Juan Islands (see map).

A big part of the experience was becoming immersed in what White describes as “canoe culture” a key part of which is “leaving the ‘it’ behind.”

“By that we mean leaving your land-based problems grievances grudges and other emotional and spiritual baggage behind” White explained. “When you step in the canoe you are entering another world where you your fellow paddlers the canoe the water the sky – everything – become almost a separate entity.

“When you leave on the journey no one really knows who each other is” she continued. “On land we may be unemployed students or highly paid and respected professionals but your onshore identity is part of the ‘it’ you leave behind.”

Other parts of canoe culture include keeping to the side with part of your body in contact with the canoe as you paddle staying in sync with the lead paddler and knowing that you as a crew are stronger with all paddles in the water singing to the rhythm of the strokes enjoying the jokes and stories and looking around to take in the world that surrounds and envelops you. “And don’t call them ‘boats’ unless you want to get thrown in the water” added White.

Canoe culture also has specific rules and procedures for visiting and interacting with the people encountered along the way. This includes a ritualized landing ceremony. As you approach a settlement the canoe captain stands up identifies who they are which tribe and asks for permission to land. Rather than landing head on the canoe is always backed into the shore as a sign of respect and non-aggression.

“My reactions were different out there” explained White. “One day we had a 4 a.m. wakeup call. It had been raining all night and we had to take down our tent break camp and be on the water at 6 a.m. In normal life I’d be so grumpy about this! But on the journey everyone is doing the same thing and going through the same thing – it didn’t even bother me. You focus on the task at hand. I knew I was meant to be there it was part of the spirit the rhythm of the trip. It’s so much bigger than just you. No one person is more important than any other.”

She also stressed the overriding ethic to focus on the canoe keep it safe and get it where it needs to be adding that “You take care of the canoe first then camp then yourself.”

This means that someone always keeps watch over the canoe.

On the last night of the trip that job fell to White and a fellow family member who camped on the beach to be with the canoes.

“We were sleeping in the open on Jackson Beach near Friday Harbor” she relates. “It was the night of the meteor shower and we just stared at the sky. The water off the beach was alive with luminescent plankton that we could actually wade through. When the sun came up the next morning I was so filled with gratitude — that I could witness all the beauty about the Earth the work of the creator things that are bigger than me. It was a truly transcendent moment that I’ve been able to take with me and is now part of my life back on land.”

Diana White has assembled her photos and remembrances of the Healing Waters Journey into a slide show that she is making available to community and school groups. To arrange a presentation contact her at Diana.white1@comcast.net.

The $1.85 trillion framework promises to make a considerable impact on the United State’s efforts against climate change to the tune of $550 billion in clean energy and climate investments over the next decade. If passed this bill will slash pollution by up to 50% by 2030 create millions of jobs in the clean energy transportation and conservation sectors and vastly improve the lives of those in underserved BIPOC and low-income communities both urban and rural. Below we explore some of the climate and environmental highlights from the bill and what they mean for the average New Yorker.

Tax Credits for a Clean Future

One of the most notable areas of investment is in expanded tax credits for clean energy manufacturing generation transmission and storage alongside clean transportation including passenger and commercial vehicles. Renewable energy tax credits have long been one of the primary engines behind U.S. climate policy and with hefty new investments in the Build Back Better Act these tax credits will be stronger than ever.

What this means

The overarching impact of clean energy storage and clean transportation tax credits on New Yorkers is simple: these credits are designed to make our energy grid and our transportation more green. Credits for utility scale renewable energy will help spur New York utilities like Con Edison to deliver on their promises of greening their energy supply meaning more homes across New York will be run on renewables. For New Yorkers who live in more densely-populated areas that have historically lagged behind in terms of clean energy generation for example New York City incentives for increased transmission will help make sure these communities are not left behind in the transition to renewable energy. Additionally credits for clean commercial transport will help chip away at one of New York’s highest-emission sectors as transportation currently accounts for 36% of our greenhouse gas emissions statewide. It will also help reduce pollution rates in communities most impacted by transportation pollution: primarily Latinx Asian and Black communities in areas like the South Bronx North Brooklyn Buffalo and Syracuse.

The impact of these credits isn’t limited to the macro-scale or businesses; they will also support New York families in making cleaner greener choices. The average middle class family in New York will be eligible to receive $12500 for buying an electric vehicle making clean transportation much more accessible for individuals and families across the state. Credits will also lower the cost of residential solar such as rooftop solar by about 30% making it more affordable for New Yorkers to install renewable energy on their own homes.

These credits also include key provisions that will help create good-paying jobs in New York’s historic manufacturing communities like the auto manufacturing community surrounding Buffalo growing the local economies of these industry hubs. For example the tax credits for electric vehicles target American-made vehicles created using union labor and domestic materials. This will translate into more transportation manufacturing jobs in New York and across the U.S. transitioning more and more workers into high-quality jobs- many of which union meaning strong labor protections- while helping to future-proof the manufacturing industry through the clean economy transition.

Resilience Investments

The Build Back Better Act also includes significant funding for resilience investments monies targeted at helping tackle some of the worst impacts of climate change including extreme weather. These investments also include funding to establish a Civilian Climate Corps and address legacy pollution in communities.

What this means

Resilience has been a big topic of discussion among New Yorkers especially as climate impacts such as more extreme weather increased flooding and extreme heat has threatened our communities even as recently as earlier this week. With these impacts ever more present in the minds of New York residents businesses and politicians investments in adapting our communities and infrastructure to this new reality offer a welcome down payment on a more resilient future. This funding will go to critical projects in areas such as coastal restoration forest management and soil conservation. Additionally these resilience investments include funding aimed at supporting farmers and forestland owners with their climate action providing an essential boost to New York’s farmers and land managers to support their environmental stewardship efforts.

By providing funding to help clean up Superfund sites improve air quality and other essential pollution remediation and mitigation efforts these resilience investments will also help many of New York’s environmental justice minority and low-income communities who disproportionately live in communities impacted by legacy pollution. This means communities from Greenpoint to Saratoga Springs and Cheektowaaga will hopefully be looking at a cleaner greener future.

Finally the establishment of a Civilian Climate Corps (CCC) will be crucial to help conserve New York’s essential ecosystems including its wetlands forests and its public lands and waters. The CCC will not only help protect valued recreation sites preserve the state’s biodiversity increase flood resiliency and provide carbon sequestrations through its conservation it will also offer the opportunity for good-paying green jobs to hundreds of young New Yorkers.

Investments and Incentives for Clean Energy Technology Manufacturing and Supply Chains

With the need for a renewable future comes the opportunity to grow the clean energy industry in the U.S. including technology manufacturing and supply chains. The $110 billion reserved for clean energy technology manufacturing and supply chain investments in Build Back Better aims to do just that.

What this means

As with the tax credits discussed above these investments and incentives will help grow and diversify New York’s manufacturing sector historically one of the cornerstones of New York’s economy with a focus on clean energy. These investments could lead to more clean energy manufacturing hubs across New York -similar to the new Port of Albany wind tower assembly facility– with positive knock-on effects in terms of economic development for surrounding communities This will mean more green jobs for New Yorkers especially important for those working in fossil fuel-reliant industries alongside more -and better- clean energy for New York homes and businesses.

Clean Energy Procurement

The last major tranche of climate investments in the Build Back Better Act framework is incentives for the government to take the lead on essential climate investments through their procurement processes a.k.a. their purchasing power. These incentives are targeted at government purchasing of next gen technologies such as long-duration storage small modular reactors and clean construction materials.

What this means

Clean energy procurement incentives will help push New York State and local governments across New York to continue to lead on the climate crisis as they have for much of the last five years. These government-backed early investments in next gen technologies will simultaneously help our governments become greener institutions while helping to speed up access to better more affordable clean energy technology for New York residents and businesses down the line.

While the Build Back Better Act includes once-in-a-lifetime climate commitments it is important to note that these historic investments are not just limited to climate. The bill tackles many key issues facing our society today from education and labor to childcare healthcare and immigration. The bill in its entirety has been constructed to benefit all Americans largely created through the lens of improving the environment and minimizing inequity in regard to race and class. The benefits of this plan described above only begin to explain all of the ways in which New York’s economy environment and people will be better off if this act is passed. No matter what specific sector the bill is discussing equity sustainability and a flourishing economy are held as equally important factors taken into consideration.

Hard seltzer is here to stay experts say but the craze that swept the nation is officially over.

Hard seltzers like White Claw became hugely popular in 2019 leading major brands to follow suit.

But now the category has become oversaturated and only a handful of brands rule the market.

After roughly three years of hard-seltzer domination Americans' love of the canned beverage may be fizzling out.

Molson Coors has nixed Coors Seltzer. Truly's parent company is dumping ""millions of cases"" of the hard seltzer. And beverage industry experts are warning that the seltzer craze is on the way out as sales wane across the sector.

It's a cool-down for a category that took over the alcohol industry as recently as 2018 spurring major investment from beer companies and inspiring almost too many upstart seltzer brands to count. And while hard seltzer sales may have boomed in 2020 as the pandemic kept people either at home or outdoors that momentum is waning in 2021.

Here's where the seltzer craze began – and why it's appears to be over.

Seltzer goes from struggling upstart to nationwide craze

Hard seltzers have been around for years – Bon & Viv launched in 2013 and even White Claw and Truly have been on the market since 2016.

But it wasn't until 2018 that the seltzer craze took off due in large part to people posting about White Claw on social media. The hashtag ""#ClawLife"" was born and then in 2019 YouTuber Trevor Wallace made a parody video dubbing 2019 ""White Claw summer"" and cementing the catch-phrase ""ain't no laws when you're drinking Claws.""

Sales of seltzer skyrocketed and White Claw sales alone quadrupled from $154.8 million in 2018 to $627.2 million in 2019 according to Bloomberg.

By the end of summer 2019 White Claw was in short supply leading its parent company Mark Anthony Brands to invest $250 million ramping up production.

The seltzer craze had officially swept the nation luring everyone from fraternity bros to the gluten-free. Analysts were predicting that sales of Truly would grow threefold by 2021 and the brand's parent company Boston Beer Company inked a deal with the National Hockey League. By October 2019 Truly announced it was overhauling its flavors in an attempt to snatch some market share from White Claw.

At the same time Natural Light and PBR announced plans to roll out affordable hard seltzers of their own and Four Loko promised a hard seltzer with a staggering 14% ABV.

UBS estimated at the time that hard seltzer could grow to be a $2.5 billion beverage category by 2021.







2020 brings about new seltzer brands – and heavier drinking

By the first quarter of 2020 the seltzer market was officially saturated. Constellation Brands – the owner of Corona Kim Crawford wines and Svedka vodka – launched Corona Seltzer spending $40 million on marketing alone CNBC reported.

Anheuser-Busch InBev debuted Bud Light Seltzer which immediately took off becoming the third-most-popular seltzer in the US weeks after launching CNN reported citing Nielsen data. And in September 2020 Molson Coors launched Coors Seltzer in four flavors: black cherry grapefruit lemon lime and mango.

And then there were a slew of smaller players that launched between 2018 and 2020: Malibu Splash High Noon Arctic Summer Wild Basin and a dozen more.

By the time the pandemic hit the hard seltzer market was ready. Trapped at home as the virus surged Americans started drinking – a lot. One study published in September 2020 found that drinking in the US was up 14% from the onset of the pandemic with hard seltzer helping to fuel the trend.

The hard seltzer category saw $4.5 billion in sales from May 2020 to May 2021 with White Claw and Truly combined making up 75% of the market share according to NielsenIQ data shared with Insider's Mary Meisenzahl.

Bud Light Seltzer remained in third and in February AB InBev said its ""beyond beer"" category which includes seltzer had topped $1 billion The Wall Street Journal reported.

In March rapper Travis Scott partnered with AB InBev to launch Cacti which sold out its inventory in only 12 hours after an ad aired during this year's Grammys. And Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer both owned by Molson Coors started to make gains particularly after the company said it would increase it seltzer production capacity by 400%.

Ahead of the summer analysts and business-owners predicted it was going to be ""a big summer for hard seltzer"" and White Claw launched Surge a new seltzer with 8% alcohol instead of the standard 5%.

Signs of a slow-down emerged halfway through 2021

But by July it seemed that seltzer's popularity was beginning to fade. Boston Beer founder Jim Koch warned in the company's second-quarter earnings that the ""hard seltzer category and overall beer industry were softer than we had anticipated.""

Bloomberg Intelligence data showed that hard seltzer sales had slowed to a crawl during the summer and data from Jefferies and Nielsen found the same: Sales growth slowed to about 30% by July 2021 down from 165% in 2020 Insider's Alex Bitter reported.

Phil Lempert a food analyst and founder of SupermarketGuru.com told Insider at the time that a return to restaurants and bars was the likely culprit with drinks like cocktails seeming like a more interesting option than a hard seltzer.

Even White Claw sales began slumping: White Claw sales dipped 12.8% during the first two weeks of September Wine Business reported citing data from Evercore ISI.

Molson Coors discontinued Coors Seltzer in the US after less than a year on the market

Coors Seltzer met its demise in July after only a few short months on shelves. Molson Coors said at the time that it didn't think seltzer brands that were an offshoot of an existing beer brand performed well according to Beverage Daily and would opt instead to focus on two other seltzer brands in its portfolio: Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer.

""We launched a number of hard seltzers in the US market and got two clear winners in Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer"" Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley told CNBC at the time. ""In order to prioritize focus and put all our investments and efforts behind our two clear winners that led us to the decision.""

Since then Vizzy has become one of the top-four seltzer brands in the US and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer will rollout across the US next year according to Forbes.

Truly's parent company dumps ""millions of cases"" of the hard seltzer

Boston Beer's Koch told CNBC this month that the company overestimated the popularity of hard seltzers getting overly ""aggressive"" about buying raw materials like flavors and cans and adding extra capacity to produce Truly Koch said during an interview on ""Closing Bell.""

""Frankly we overbought"" he said. ""And when the growth stopped we had more of all those things than we were going to be able to use because there is a shelf life.""

Now Boston Beer plans to throw away the excess cases rather than sell them at a discount. Koch told CNBC that the company would rather eat the product than run the risk of selling customers stale Trulys.

But Boston Beer isn't the only company taking a hit when it comes to seltzers: Constellation Brands said in its most recent earnings that it has excess inventory of hard seltzers ""resulting from a slowdown in the overall category in the US.""

The craze has fizzled out but seltzers are here to stay

Bethany Biron/Business Insider



It would be oversimplifying it to say that the hard seltzer category as a whole is on the decline or that the world has moved on from hard seltzer.

But it's safe to say that the craze is over due in large part to how big the category gotten – Brandy Rand an analyst with research firm IWSR told Bloomberg earlier this year that ""the larger the category the harder it is to achieve double and triple-digit growth.""

Plus the bigger players with large distribution networks are likely to edge out the seltzer upstarts still trying to gain a foothold in the market. ""The winners are going to be the ones that have the best distribution"" Lempert of SupermarketGuru.com told Insider in July. ""That's No. 1.""

At this point the brands that will succeed will need to have ""a clear point of difference"" Molson Coors' CEO Hattersley said during the company's most recent earnings call.

""We have been saying for more than a year now that (hard seltzers) couldn't continue to grow at the pace they were at"" he said. ""But they are now a part of the alcohol space and they are here to stay.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jeffrey C. Belanger

Painted Post - Jeffrey C. Belanger age 50 of Painted Post New York passed away on Tuesday October 26 2021 at Robert Packer Hospital with his wife and children at his side. He was born on March 29 1971 to Charles and Georgia (Stackhouse) Belanger. He married Kristina LaValley on October 16 1993.

He was employed by Ziegler's Florist in Horseheads for the past 8 years.

In his free time Jeffrey will be remembered for his fascination with flipping furniture yard work sitting by the fire pit on Sunday mornings with Bella home renovation and his endless marathons of ""Fixer Upper"" and The Food Network. His love for the outdoors could be seen in every tree homeless plant and bush he found and brought home to bring to life. He was unbelievably proud of his children in everything they accomplished no matter how big or small - they truly were the most precious gifts he ever had.

Jeffrey is survived by wife: Kristina Belanger; children: Mira Belanger Noah Belanger; mother and father in law: Nancy and Brandon LaValley; brothers: Brian (Nanette) Belanger Gregory (Shannon) Belanger Charles F. Belanger Jr sister in law: Erin (Jason) Wolcott; four legged companion: Bella along with several nieces nephews great niece aunts uncles cousins and very special family friends.

Jeffrey was predeceased by many loved ones.

Family and friends are invited to call on Saturday November 13 2021 from 1:00pm-3:00pm at Phillips Funeral Home 17 W. Pulteney Street Corning NY 14830. A private Celebration of Life will be held at the funeral home following the conclusion of calling hours.

Jeffrey loved flowers but his love for his children would not be surpassed. In lieu of flowers donations to his children's college fund may be sent to: Corning Credit Union1 Credit Union Plaza Corning NY 14830 C/O Mira and Noah Belanger College Fund Savings.

No it’s not a haunted house said Trineen Lopes and Shannon Pabo of the Kaua‘i Community College Cognitions program (they’re still waiting on the return of the Lights on Rice holiday parade!).

They created an interactive dynamic backdrop for the Showtime Characters’ selfie stations at Kukui Grove Center in Lihu‘e.

Yes the pair will be on hand today Halloween when the Resilience Project Keiki to Career folks host the Trunk or Treat in the Kukui Grove parking lot fronting Nawiliwili Road from 3 to 6 p.m. (Lots of time left for neighborhood trick-or-treating!)

Kimberly Hope (she also was on the entertainment lineup with Hank Curtis for the Kukui Grove Halloween Festival) is getting excited with her dog Rusty. Kimberly will host a Halloween special on YouTube livestream today from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. with special guest appearances and perhaps some prizes for anyone who sends in a selfie with their best Halloween costume.

Kudos to Stacie Chiba-Miguel Pillare Mukai (Harvey Maeda said she did a lion’s share of pushing and pulling!) and The Shops at Kukui‘ula for pulling together the sold-out Trunk or Treat event where keiki in costume could get a free keiki cone at Lappert’s and get to tease the sandworm popping up near the Earthworks Pacific excavator.

More kudos to Tisha Ruiz of the Hawai‘i Foodbank Kaua‘i Branch for getting the information for the Westside food drive at the Westside Christian Center Assembly of God church Thursday. Through the efforts of Stephanie Iona and a lot of community-minded sponsors they have another Harvest Celebration today starting at 5 p.m.

Happy Halloween!

Defining the index

The CoStar report focuses on a relative measure of property prices called the CoStar Commercial Repeat Sales Index (CCRSI). This index is computed based on the resale of properties whose earlier sales prices and sales dates are known. The index represents the relative change in the price of property over time rather than its absolute price. Real Capital Analytics uses a similar approach in their research.

In September 2021 there were 1812 sales pairs for all of the property types tracked by CoStar. Since CoStar does not break out the number of transactions by property type we do not know how many of those transactions were for multifamily properties.

Comparing commercial property types

The first chart shows how multifamily property prices have changed over time relative to the composite price of the other primary commercial property types CoStar tracks. The data is normalized so that both indexes are set to a value of 100 in December 2000. The change in the value of each index since then shows how the relative price of that property type has changed. The chart shows that multifamily property price gains have exceeded the composite of the price rises of other commercial property types over the last 20 years. It also shows that multifamily property prices have recently surged higher.

The second chart focuses on the price trends of these two indexes since the start of 2012 and it looks at them in terms of year-over-year price growth. The chart also included lines representing the average rate of price change for each asset group over the time period illustrated in the chart.

The chart shows the recent surge in multifamily property prices. It also shows that a price surge of this magnitude is not unprecedented. However when this last happened in 2015 the period of high price growth was accentuated by there being very low price growth in the same period of the prior year. The recent uptick in the index of commercial property x-multifamily is similarly being aided by the index having experienced actual declines the year before. However the surge in multifamily property prices this year comes after those prices rose at nearly the long-term average rate last year.

The lines representing the average rate of price appreciation for the two indexes show that the average rate of growth in multifamily property prices has exceeded that of other commercial property taken together by 2.2 percent per year over the 9+ year time span represented.

Looking closer

Some of the CoStar’s results such as those for individual commercial property types are only reported on a quarterly basis. This is presumably so that enough sales-pairs can be recorded in these smaller sub-categories that the results aren’t unduly influenced by a few atypical sales. The latest report includes the results for Q3 2021 and so it contains the full range of perspectives CoStar offers.

When comparing the equal-weighted CCRSI from Q3 2021 to that of Q3 2020 the best performing commercial property type was industrial with a 13.9 percent price appreciation. The next best was retail at 13.7 percent followed by land at 13.3 percent. Multifamily property price appreciation was 12.5 percent on this basis. Office prices rose 5.2 percent while prices for hospitality properties dropped 1.5 percent.

CoStar also calculates a value-weighted CCRSI. This index puts more emphasis on the fewer high-priced property sales than on the more numerous but lower-priced transactions. The year-over-year rise in the value-weighted CCRSI for multifamily properties was only 11.6 percent. The fact that this rise was lower than that for the equal-weighted CCRSI implies that prices are rising less rapidly for higher-priced multifamily properties than they are for lower-priced properties.

Comparing regions

The next chart shows how the CoStar multifamily price indexes for the four Census regions of the United States have changed since 2000. As before each of the indexes is normalized to a value of 100 in December 2000 and the chart shows the relative change in value since then. Having a higher index value for a give region does not necessarily mean that the price of the property in dollars per door or dollars per square foot is higher than in the other regions since the property prices were different by region in December 2000 which is used as the basis for comparison.

The chart shows that the Northeast has been the region with the highest appreciation in multifamily property prices since December 2000 but the growth in prices there has slowed since 2017. Price appreciation in the West region has continued at a strong pace and the gap between the indexes for the West and for the Northeast has been closing. The CCRSI for the South has also risen steadily in recent years.

Using CoStar’s equal weighted indexes and comparing to year-earlier levels prices were up by 14.1 percent in the South 11.5 percent in the West 9.1 percent in the Midwest and 5.7 percent in the Northeast.

The last chart shows the year-over-year change in the regional multifamily property price indexes for the last 5 years along with the average rates of appreciation in the CCRSI for each region over that time. The chart shows that the average performance for property in the Northeast has lagged that of the other regions of the country and since March 2020 the appreciation of the CCRSI for Northeast property has even underperformed its 5-year average. On the other hand the West and the South have had nearly equal rates of price appreciation averaging over double the rate in the Northeast.

The full report has additional information about transaction volumes including “distressed” transactions. However this data is not broken out by property type. The full report can be found here.",,,,,,,,,

A membership to the wholesale retailer opens up a world of cult-loved sheet cakes ready-to-cook beef Wellington that 8-foot tall bear everyone is obsessed with and even competitively-priced gasoline for your car. Personally I’m big on the satisfyingly sturdy crust of a Costco frozen pizza. But preferences aside navigating the discount-filled emporium can be overwhelming even for the most seasoned of shoppers. So when chef Lizzy Briskin of Earthen took to Insider to share what to buy at Costco we gladly jotted down the suggested staples as a professional roadmap of sorts. After all who better to act as your Costco guru than a chef?

A few weeks later Briskin followed up her post with—arguably—an even more valuable piece: the Costco items she would never recommend. Now that we have a fully-rounded hot-or-not list of sorts for everyone’s favorite big-box wholesale store we pulled a few of the chef’s most notable suggestions.

Costco Must Have: Wine

Did you know that Costco is the largest wine retailer in the U.S.? Well now you do and you should also know that Costco wine bottle markups are about 10 to 20% lower than competing liquor stores. Hot tip (and great news) for those in states like Arizona California Colorado New York and Texas: you don’t even need a membership to buy alcohol at Costco.

Costco Must Not: Cold Cuts

This probably applies to the vacuum-sealed meats at any store but particularly when it comes to buying cold cuts in bulk. “Sliced deli meats have a very brief shelf life once they’re opened” Briskin writes. “You’re better off choosing freshly sliced ham from your local butcher or deli counter in an amount that you can consume within a few days.”

Costco Must Have: Pure Vanilla Extract

It’s always a good idea to have the go-to baking ingredient on hand but the real deal can be pricey. Fortunately you can get the good stuff for a fraction of the cost thanks to Costco’s in-house brand Kirkland Signature.

Costco Must Not: Sour Cream

Even sour cream fiends probably couldn’t get through Costco-sized quarts of the tart topping before it goes bad. Sour cream also unfortunately does not freeze well.

Costco Must Have: Butter

One dairy item that does freeze well: butter. And as Nora Ephron once wrote you can truly never have too much of it.

Costco Must Not: Frozen Salmon

Not too surprisingly our chef prefers her salmon fresh. Thankfully Briskin is a fan of the options at Costco’s seafood counter.

Costco Must Have: Quinoa

Like so many trendy ingredients quinoa is often priced at a premium simply for being sought-after. Costco’s pricing is fair and a big bag of grains from the retailer can last (and keep) for months. “Although quinoa is full of plant-based protein fiber vitamins and minerals it doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg” Briskin says.

The chef also recommends picking up a heaping helping of sauerkraut which is filled with natural probiotics and stays well preserved for months in the refrigerator.

Costco Must Not: Peeled Garlic

This goes for the pre-peeled garlic at Costco and beyond. “No one likes the tedious task of prying papery skin off a tiny clove of garlic” Briskin explains. “But it’s a labor of love and the only way to get fresh garlic flavor into your food.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNjQ4MDY4L3doYXQtY29zdGNvLWZhbnMtYXJlLXNheWluZy1hYm91dC10aGlzLWxhdHRlLWFuZC1mcmFwcGUtbWl4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Costco Fans Are Saying About This Latte And Frappe Mix,"What Costco Fans Are Saying About This Latte And Frappe Mix

Since it first opened in 1983 in Seattle (via Insider) Costco has grown to become more of a destination than simply a store. Similar to Target the wholesale retailer isn't just a place to run errands — it's now a place to go and peruse for hours on a lazy Sunday afternoon. One of the primary draws of Costco is the food. Sure there are samples around almost every corner in the grocery section and some of your favorite brand names available in bulk but there are also products exclusive to Costco that have garnered cult followings.

Some of those must-have treats include the budget-friendly Kirkland wine the infamous macaroni and cheese bucket and the juicy rotisserie chicken. Customers are always on the hunt for the latest and greatest items at Costco so when one person found a new latte and frappe mix at the retailer people on social media had a lot of opinions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYXUubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYml6YXJyZS1yZWFzb24taW5mbHVlbmNlcnMtYXJlLXBvc2luZy1vdXRzaWRlLWNvc3Rjby0wNzI2NTIwNjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bizarre reason influencers are posing outside Costco,"Covid-19 forced people to tap into some inner creativity in many areas of their lives.

Way of 'coping' with travel restrictions

According to Quartz the trend is the younger generation’s way of coping with Pandemic travel restrictions along with their interest in American culture.

A now-viral Twitter post posted on October 26 shows influencers posing in shopping trolleys outside the giant store uploaded Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu.

""This must be exactly how Japanese people feel when they see Americans flip out over their extremely normal suburban street scenes. One person’s banality is another’s Instagram shot"" user giorgiomomurder wrote under the collage of photos.

""To clarify they aren’t trying to trick anyone these are guides on how to make your pictures “look like Los Angeles” by going to Costco which is [in my opinion] WAY funnier"" he added.

Costco chaos

Shanghai's Costco store opened in 2019 with viral clips circulating worldwide showing chaotic scenes from opening day.

The store was so popular when it first opened its doors it was forced to close after five hours of opening telling customers not to come.

“The store has been clogged up with crowds” Costco reportedly sent in a text message to customers in China according to WTKR.

“To provide you with better shopping experience Costco will suspend business in the afternoon. Please don’t come.”

The store has since capped the number of customers in the store to 2000.

CANDIDATE QUESTIONS

What is the main issue facing Elm City and what are your plans to address that issue?

MOORE: Public works infrastructure and downtown revitalization are the biggest complaints facing our town. Once elected as mayor I plan to facilitate collaborative efforts with our staff board members and town residents that will 1. Establish our own public works department; 2. Continue measures to improve our infrastructure; 3. Beautify our downtown; 4. Partner with Wilson County the city of Wilson and the state’s economic development teams; and 5. Update our Ordinance 160-D.

SMITH: Currently we are working to get the sewer moratorium lifted that is preventing new businesses and homes from being built. That is one of our main issues preventing Elm City’s growth. We also have needs we want to get addressed with flooding and water quality but funding issues are making this harder to complete. I welcome the community to become involved in things they would like to do to help the town in their own way.

If elected what would you do to stay responsive to your constituents’ concerns?

MOORE: Once elected mayor I will do as I’ve always done; be visible in the community support civic organizations and churches shop locally and visit homes upon request. My ear email scheduled office hours and personal cellphone will always be available. Following up with our citizens is important. I will continue to bring issues and concerns to the table.

SMITH: As current mayor our citizens are welcome to voice concerns and attend town meetings. Currently the town administration posts information to keep the community updated on the town’s website and sends out newsletters monthly. I think having an open form of communication is important for the town’s growth so all concerns are heard. I would like to have some open forums to solicit our citizens’ feedback.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ibG9nLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzMwL2p1bmt5YXJkLWdlbS0yMDA2LWJ1aWNrLWx1Y2VybmUtY3hsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Junkyard Gem: 2006 Buick Lucerne CXL,"When The General's Buick Division axed the LeSabre and Park Avenue names in 2005 (after 46 and 30 years respectively though the Park Avenue returned a few years later in China) the replacement top-of-the-line Buick sedan became the new Lucerne. It wasn't the Buick with the biggest price tag that year— those honors went to the Terraza minivan and Rainier SUV— but it became the flag-bearer for a bloodline of cushy prestigious Buick sedans that stretched all the way back to the early days of the American auto industry. Lucerne sales for the 2006 and 2007 model years went pretty well and now enough time has passed that some of these cars are showing up in the self-service car boneyards I frequent. Here's a first-year example with the optional Northstar V8 engine found in a Northern California yard last summer.

Plenty of American cars have been named after cities in Italy France and Spain but the Lucerne is the only one I can think of that bears the name of a Swiss city (to be fair the entire Chevrolet Division is named after a Swiss man so Switzerland didn't really get shortchanged by The General in the naming department). CXL was the Lucerne's mid-grade trim level sandwiched between the CX and CSX.

The high-zoot Lucerne CSX got the 4.6-liter Northstar as standard equipment but this quad-cam V8 and its 279 horses cost extra on the CXL. The base engine for the CX and CXL was the good old 3.8-liter pushrod Buick V6 rated at 197 horsepower. No US-market 2006 Buick could be purchased new with a manual transmission; this car has a four-speed automatic.

In a Buick tradition stretching back to the late 1940s this car boasts flashy ""Ventiports"" on the fenders. In past years the number of ports on each side designated the car's intended swank level; starting with the Lucerne they indicated the number of engine cylinders. So when you're crawling around your local Ewe Pullet and looking for Northstars seek out the Lucernes with the four-hole Ventiports.

""Leather-appointed"" power bucket seats and ""wood-toned"" trim were standard on the CXL as well as an MP3-capable CD player with six speakers. By 2006 most American vehicle shoppers seeking something big and luxurious chose trucks and truck-like machines but the market still supported quite a few sedan models such as the Lucerne.

Most US-market GM vehicles got these little square ""Mark of Excellence"" fender badges during the late 2000s. Soon after The General filed for Chapter 11 in 2009 though they disappeared.

The car the press can't stop talking about.

London in particular was an especially popular target experiencing almost nightly attacks between 1940 and 1941. While many residents took shelter a member of the Royal Air Force used the air raids to cover his heinous crimes.

Gordon Cummins

Gordon Cummins was born in New Earswick North Yorkshire to a civil servant and a housewife. He moved to London in 1934 where he developed a desire to live the lavish life of an aristocrat. He falsely claimed to be the illegitimate child of a peer from whom he received an allowance and refined his dialect to imitate an Oxford accent. To maintain this facade he engaged in acts of embezzlement and theft.

Cummins volunteered for the RAF in 1935. He initially trained to be a rigger and was tasked with flight checks on aircraft. He was then stationed with the Marine and Armament Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe Suffolk and relocated to Scotland from 1936 to 1939.

Upon the outbreak of WWII he was transferred to Helensburgh Dubartonshire after which he was stationed at Colerne Wiltshire. It was at this post that he reached the junior rank of leading aircraftman despite aspirations of becoming a Spitfire pilot. He was then transferred to Cornwall.

In January 1942 after accruing over 1000 of flight time Cummins went before the RAF selection board for his aviation exam. His performance earned him a move to the Air Crew Receiving Center in Regent’s Park where he was stationed with 300 other airmen.

The Blitz

Between 1940 and 1941 the German Army inflicted a mass air raid bombing upon London. Coined “Blitzkrieg” by the British press it began toward the end of the Battle of Britain and was used as a way to subdue England. Hitler was turning his sights to Eastern Europe and didn’t want the British Army to interfere with his plans.

The bombings began on September 7 1940 and continued for 57 consecutive nights after which they occurred less frequently. Large swaths of London were ruined and many lost their lives. Mandatory blackouts were ordered meaning street lamps remained unlit cars couldn’t drive with their headlights on and the windows of businesses and homes had to be covered.

Looking to lessen the number of casualties the city opened up public air raid shelters and allowed people to congregate in the underground train stations. Many residents took cover in cellars and personal bomb shelters.

Cummins’ murders

The first victim of Cummins’ murder spree was located on the morning of February 9 1942. Schoolteacher Evelyn Hamilton’s body was found in an air raid shelter in the West End gagged with a scarf and strangled to death. Her handbag which contained £80 was missing.

The second victim a prostitute and former chorus girl named Evelyn Oatley was found the next day in her apartment. The murder was eerily similar to that of Hamilton except for the fact her abdomen had been slashed with a can opener which was left at the scene. Unbeknownst to the killer it held his bloody fingerprints.

After a brief hiatus victims three and four were discovered on February 13 1942. Both were prostitutes. Margaret Lowe missing since February 10 had been strangled and mutilated. Doris Jouannet’s body was discovered by police after her husband was unable to enter the door to the apartment they shared.

Cummins’ final two victims were saved by strokes of luck. The attack on Greta Heywood was interrupted by a delivery boy who caused the RAF pilot to flee the scene. While leaving he dropped his gas mask and haversack. Later that night he attempted another attack on a woman named Kathleen Mulcahy. She fought him off and made enough noise to make him flee before he was caught.

Speaking about the crimes committed a Detective Superintendent with London’s Metropolitan Police called the murders “by far the most vicious” he’d investigated throughout his career.

“The Blackout Ripper”

Due to wartime restrictions on newsprint and the focus on the war in Europe the murders received little attention from the media. Despite this it did manage to reach those prostitutes working in the West End who appeared to be Cummins’ primary targets. In an attempt to protect themselves many became reluctant to take on clients who weren’t considered regulars.

While the crimes didn’t receive a lot of attention the media did find the time to give the killer a nickname. In fact he had three: “The Blackout Ripper” “The Wartime Ripper” and “The Blackout Killer.” They referenced the fact the murders happened during the war were reminiscent of the murders committed by Jack The Ripper and were committed while London experienced an air raid.

Arrest and conviction

Gordon Cummins’ gas mask proved to be the key to connecting him to the murders. After jotting down its serial number investigators with the Metropolitan Police contacted the RAF Police who in turn contacted Cummins’ regiment at Regent’s Park.

While he tried to maintain his innocence the evidence was stacked against him. Along with the gas mask and fingerprints left on the can opener a search of Cummins’ belongings uncovered a host of mementos taken from his victims. This included stockings from each victim a watch and a cigarette case belonging to Evelyn Oatley.

They also had a positive identification from Heywood as the man who attacked her.

Rather than try Cummins for all the murders prosecutors opted to try him first for the murder of Evelyn Oatley. This way if the jury acquitted him they could proceed with further charges. On April 27 1942 after a single day in court Cummins was found guilty for Oatley’s murder and sentenced to death.

In a strange twist of fate George Cummins’ execution occurred during a German air raid on the city of London. On June 25 1942 he was walked to the gallows of Wandsworth Prison where he was hanged.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FyY29uZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMjAyMTEwMzEtZW5jLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ElDorado National introducing electric Axess bus in 40- 35- and 32-foot lengths; Cummins drive system battery,"ElDorado National (California) or ENC a subsidiary of REV Group will launch its fully electric Axess bus at APTA Expo 8-10 November 2021. In addition to being the first zero-corrosion battery electric bus (BEB) it is the first to offer 40' 35' and 32' bus lengths.

ENC partnered with Cummins for the electric powertrain/battery system on the Axess; the Axess BEB uses Cummins NMC batteries in either 444 or 518 kWh configurations. Cummins will support the electric propulsion system and batteries through more than 600 distributors world-wide.





ENC’s BEB is built on the proven Axess platform which has more than 20 years of trusted performance and is the only EV bus in the industry that features a zero-corrosion 100% 304-grade stainless steel body structure/composite exterior.

In addition ENC was the first mass transit bus manufacturer to introduce front or center door ADA compliant wheelchair ramps. The BEB Axess offers multiple configurations for passenger seating and wheelchair accommodations.

The Axess is also the first heavy-duty low-floor bus in the industry to offer 3-point passenger seat belts. Driver visibility and comfort is improved by the largest windshield in the industry which is angled to deflect the glare of interior lighting and helps to create a quieter bus with less drag driving on the road. The tall windshield and low dash offer greater visibility for drivers of any stature.

ENC has manufactured low-floor and standard-floor buses for more than 45 years to public transit/paratransit airport and university transportation markets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc3dpbXN3YW0uY29tL2Rpc3RhbmNlLWZyZWVzdHlsZXItYXNobGVpZ2gtYmFyb3MtY29tbWl0cy10by1taXNzb3VyaS1zdC1sb3Vpcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Distance Freestyler Ashleigh Baros Commits to Missouri-St. Louis,"Fitter and Faster Swim Camps is the proud sponsor of SwimSwam’s College Recruiting Channel and all commitment news. For many swimming in college is a lifelong dream that is pursued with dedication and determination. Fitter and Faster is proud to honor these athletes and those who supported them on their journey.

Ashleigh Baros a senior and co-captain of the swim team at Xavier College Preparatory School in Phoenix has verbally committed to the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

“I am excited to announce my verbal commitment to the University of Missouri-St. Louis. I am beyond happy to be continuing both my academic and athletic career at UMSL. Thank you to my family coaches and friends for their endless support in and out of the pool! Go Tritons!”

Baros placed 17th in the 500 freestyle and 20th in the 100 breaststroke at the 2020 AIA Division I Swim and Dive State Championships. Most recently at the Craig Cummins Invitational she placed fifth in the 200 freestyle.

She also swims club for Phoenix Swim Club. At the 2021 Phoenix Summer Invitational she placed fifth in the 1500-meter freestyle sixth in the 400-meter IM ninth in the 200-meter freestyle and 100-meter breaststroke and eleventh in the 200-meter IM.

Her best short course times are:

200 freestyle: 1:59.90

500 freestyle: 5:19.31

1000 freestyle: 10:39.20

100 breaststroke: 1:10.71

The University of Missouri-St. Louis is a Division II school and member of the Great Lakes Valley Conference. At the 2021 GLVC women’s championship USML placed seventh out of nine teams.

At that meet Baros would have been the third-fastest Triton in the 500 freestyle behind Rebecca Bechtel and Maria Serra Bonet. Baros will have the opportunity to train with both of them — Bechtel will be a senior next year and Bonet will be a junior.

There were no USML swimmers in the 1000 freestyle so Baros could add depth to the Tritons’ distance team especially since her time would’ve placed her in the top 16 at that meet.

Eoin Morgan’s England are the 50-over World Cup champions and chasing a second T20 global title after their 2010 triumph.

Both teams go into Saturday’s clash in Dubai with two wins in two games and the semi-finals enticingly within reach.

Adding extra spice is the approaching Ashes series which starts in December.

“It’s always huge. We play England a lot. I think the style of play is quite similar. We like to take the game on” said Cummins on Friday.

“They’ve been probably just about the form team the last few years in white ball cricket. We know it’s such a big game in the context of making the semi-finals.”

Australia are the current holders of the Ashes. However few in the T20 teams are regular Test players.

For example Morgan and Australia skipper Aaron Finch will not be involved while England fast bowler Tymal Mills only plays the T20 format.

“The majority of the side are mainly white ball players. Different format. I wouldn’t read into it too much” added Cummins who does excel in both formats.

In the 2019 Ashes in England he was his team’s leading wicket-taker with 28.

Cummins said Australia will continue playing four specialist pacers at the Twenty20 World Cup with their all-rounders shouldering the fifth bowler’s role.

All-rounders Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis conceded a combined 51 runs from their four wicketless overs in Thursday’s seven-wicket victory against Sri Lanka.

Asked if Australia were tempted to revert to their five-bowler theory Cummins said ruled out dumping the strategy which worked in the opener against South Africa when Maxwell claimed 24-1 in four overs.

“I think the flexibility that structure gives us is just huge” Cummins said.

Against Sri Lanka Maxwell bled 16 runs in his only over bowled during the powerplay before being taken off the attack but Cummins said Australia and quick Mitchell Starc still benefited from it.

“Maxi bowling one in the first six (overs) means Starcy can have an extra over through the middle. We saw he took a couple wickets in the middle overs that’s because we were able to have someone like Maxi ball early” Cummins added.

“Stoinis still hasn’t bowled a lot but we know how much of an impact he can be with the ball let alone having the option to now have that extra batter.

“I think we’re really well suited. We were covering a lot of areas with that fifth bowler. We’ve got Maxwell Stoinis [Mitchell] Marsh all who can contribute those four overs.”

Meanwhile England backed-up their credentials with a six-wicket win against defending champions West Indies and an eight-wicket defeat of Bangladesh.

“It’s probably going to be one of our most difficult games” Morgan said of Saturday’s game. “Australia are a very strong side — they’ve won two from two much like us — and have started well.

“Our level of performance and intensity has been very good and the challenge is to continue that for our next three games in pursuit of getting to that next stage.”

Morgan admitted that fast bowlers Mark Wood (ankle) and Tom Curran (knee) are both still likely to sit out the match.

“They’re progressing really well” Morgan said. “Where we were before the first game they’ve come on a long way.”

Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins believes that all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell are enabling Aussies to be flexible with their attack bowlers.

Australia won their Super 12 stage clash against Sri Lanka during which Maxwell bowled only one over in the first six overs and Stoinis bowled three overs including one in the death overs.

""Maxi bowling one in the first six (overs) means Starcy [Mitchell Starc] can have an extra over through the middle. We saw he took a couple of wickets in the middle overs that's because we were able to have someone like Maxi ball early"" Cummins said ahead of the clash against Ashes rivals England.

""Stoinis still hasn't bowled a lot but we know how much of an impact he can be with the ball let alone having the option to now have that extra batter.

""I think we're really well suited. We were covering a lot of areas with that fifth bowler. We've got Maxwell Stoinis Mitchell Marsh all who can contribute those four overs.""

Maxwell and Stoinis conceded a total of 51 runs from their four wicketless overs. ""I think the flexibility that structure gives us is just huge"" Cummins said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed extra doses of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccines Oct. 21.

Walgreens said both Moderna and Johnson & Johnson booster shots are now available in stores nationwide though availability will vary by location.

Meanwhile CVS Health announced that select pharmacy and MinuteClinic locations began offering the Moderna COVID-19 booster shot to eligible populations Friday in addition to the previously authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster.

According to the company more than 100 CVS locations across the Chicago area and 400 throughout Illinois will administer the doses.

Those interested in getting a booster shot or initial vaccine doses can schedule an appointment through Walgreens here or call 1-800 Walgreens or a local Walgreens store.

For CVS appointments can be made here and ""are strongly encouraged."" When making an appointment patients will be asked to provide the manufacturer and date of their last COVID-19 vaccine shot.

“The systems we’ve built and our deep experience in providing vaccinations allows us to play a leading role in administering booster shots to eligible populations” said Troyen A. Brennan M.D. MPH Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of CVS Health. “We also remain focused on providing easy and convenient opportunities for the unvaccinated to receive their first doses.”

Both pharmacy chains noted that eligible populations can now choose to receive a dose different from the one they received for their initial series following new guidance from both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration.

“Walgreens pharmacy teams are available to answer questions and make it easy to understand eligibility requirements and access COVID-19 vaccine whether it’s a first dose or booster shot” Rina Shah group vice president pharmacy operations and services at Walgreens said in a statement.

Walgreens said that while ""it is recommended individuals receive the same product for their booster dose as they did for their primary series"" if the original brand is not available or another brand is preferred mixing and matching will be allowed.

In addition to previously-announced Pfizer vaccine booster shot eligibility here's a look at who can now get the booster shots:

Moderna COVID-19 Booster Eligibility: Eligibility requirements for Moderna and Pfizer-BioTech booster doses are the same. Individuals must wait at least six months after they complete their initial mRNA COVID-19 primary vaccine series to receive their booster dose.

Wearing blue light glasses may sound like a good solution but a recent study determined there was little evidence to support the use of blue-blocking filters in the prevention of digital eye strain.

But blue light is known to sabotage your sleep schedule because it messes with your circadian rhythm (AKA your internal clock that tells you when it’s time to sleep or be awake). So if you’re scrolling through your phone late at night or have insomnia blue light glasses might be a good option.

With most of us unable to escape having to use computers tablets and phones in our everyday life how do we handle the negative consequences of digital screens?

Ophthalmologist Nicole Bajic MD discusses blue light glasses and what other ways you can prevent digital eye strain.

What are blue light glasses?

Blue light blocking glasses have specially crafted lenses that are said to block or filter out the blue light given off from digital screens. The lenses are often marketed with lofty claims that they protect your eyes from eye strain and can help reduce potential damage to your retina from prolonged exposure to blue light.

Can blue light glasses help with eye strain?

It may surprise you but many eye issues that are caused by digital screens aren’t due to blue light.

Dr. Bajic says many people experience eye discomfort from digital screens but most of the issues actually fall under a term called computer vision syndrome (CVS). (It’s sometimes also referred to as digital eye strain.) Some symptoms include:

Watery eyes.

Dry eyes.

Blurred vision.

Sensitivity to light.

Headache.

Neck and shoulder pain.

Difficulty concentrating.

Burning eyes.

Itchy eyes.

Hard time keeping your eyes open.

CVS is a broad range of eye strain and discomfort issues. Your eyes are constantly shifting focus and moving while looking at the screen. Plus the glare and contrast can be tough on your eyes. So although you may be experiencing eye irritation from a long day working on your computer your eye discomfort is not directly from the blue light itself.

“When we stare at a digital screen or device for too long we’re not blinking as often as we normally would which causes the cornea to become dry and irritated” says Dr. Bajic. “When we focus our eyes on something close up like a screen or even a book our eyes are strained and contracted which can cause eye discomfort. But if you look ahead to a distant object our eyes relax.”

Is it bad to wear blue light glasses?

Though blue light glasses aren’t effective at preventing digital eye strain there is no harm in wearing them.

“It is not harmful to wear them all day” says Dr. Bajic.

Tips for dealing with digital eye strain

While blue light glasses may not help here are a few things you can do to provide relief to your eyes.

Wear light sensitivity glasses

“If someone has light sensitivity due to migraines or other light-sensitive conditions they can get an FL-41 tint which is a better option than blue light glasses” says Dr. Bajic.

The FL-41 tint which ranges from a pinkish color to an amber-like color filters out wavelengths of blue and green. Those colors are bothersome to patients with light sensitivity. A study cited photophobia the medical term for light sensitivity as the most bothersome symptom for those with migraines.

You can find options for light sensitivity glass online and at most optometrists. While FL-41 tint might not be covered by most insurances check with your provider.

Practice the 20-20-20 rule

Every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

“By looking a further distance away it forces the eyes to relax by breaking accommodation” says Dr. Bajic. “It also helps you to blink again at your body’s normal rate.”

Use artificial tears

Using eye drops throughout the day can help keep your eyes lubricated while you work at a computer.

Regular artificial tears should be used no more than four times a day as the eyes can be sensitive to the preservatives in them. If someone needs to use them more often they should switch to preservative-free artificial tears.

“Artificial tears are supposed to be used as lip balm or lotion: Most people don’t need them at all but others need to incorporate them into their routine as needed to be more comfortable” says Dr. Bajic.

Sit an arm’s length (about 25 inches or 63 centimeters) away from your screen

Most people sit too close to the computer and experience eye strain. Try backing up and increasing the font size on your screen to help with readability.

“People should sit a comfortable distance away from screens” says Dr. Bajic.

So should you invest in a pair of blue light glasses? When it comes to preventing eyestrain your best bet is to save your money and practice good screen habits throughout the day instead. However if you use screens late at night and have trouble falling asleep they may be a good option.

U.S. residents can search for sites offering COVID-19 vaccines by ZIP code at Vaccines.gov which many states now point to for those seeking nearby vaccine appointments as opposed to county-by-county provider dashboards.

English-speaking residents can text GETVAX (438829) and Spanish-speaking residents can text VACUNA (822862) to find out the three vaccine sites closest to them.

Pharmacy chains across the U.S. — like CVS Walgreens and Rite-Aid — are currently taking vaccine appointments and may accept walk-ins.

Those eligible can schedule booster appointments online at Walgreens (or by calling 1-800-Walgreens) at CVS and at Rite-Aid.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health is now using Vaccines.gov as the mapping source to help residents find a vaccine site near them.

Philadelphia

Philadelphia residents may opt to receive their COVID-19 vaccine through the city’s health centers where they may walk in without an appointment. Those who prefer to schedule an appointment can do so by calling 215-685-2933.

Alternatively residents may choose to get vaccinated at Philadelphia pop-up vaccine clinics.

The city also offers in-home vaccination services for people with disabilities and older adults who are unable to leave the house.

Eligible Jefferson Health patients including Philadelphia residents and Montgomery and Bucks County residents may schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments online.

Penn Medicine is providing booster shots to eligible people though it is not currently offering “mix and match” boosters. It plans to offer them in the future in conjunction with CDC guidance.

Penn Medicine also encouraged residents to consider receiving their booster shots from their local pharmacy “due to our limited capacity to provide boosters.”

“Unlike last winter there is ample supply of vaccine in the community” reads Penn Medicine’s guidance “including at retail pharmacies close to your home.”

People can schedule vaccine appointments by calling Penn Medicine’s COVID-19 Vaccine Scheduling Hotline between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at 267-758-4902.

Temple Health which is working to contact eligible patients offers booster shots at Temple University Hospital – Main Campus on North Broad Street and Temple – Roosevelt Boulevard Vaccine Clinic on Roosevelt Boulevard. Appointments and walk-ins are accepted Monday through Wednesday and Friday from noon to 5 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL3RydXN0LWluLWRvY3RvcnMtZXJvZGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The pandemic has eroded our trust in doctors,"In medicine the relationship between doctor and patient is predicated on that most basic of societal values: trust. The concept of this relationship — and the notion that it is dependent on both parties' participation — dates to the Greek enlightenment around the 5th century B.C.E. Patients trust that their health care provider will make treatment recommendations based on what is in the best interest of a patient's health while doctors trust that patients will report symptoms honestly and execute treatment plans faithfully.

As it turns out trust is in short supply largely thanks to COVID-19.

I was reminded of this on a recent family visit to my parents-in-law who live in rural western Pennsylvania. All of us have been fully vaccinated and to be careful we all tested ourselves for COVID-19 the night before our arrival and during our visit. My mother-in-law who has lupus and is on immunosuppressive therapy had recently received her 3rd COVID-19 vaccine following the guidelines provided by the CDC.

This was no small feat. When she first tried to obtain a booster shot from a local CVS pharmacy she was turned away and erroneously told that the shots were only available to people who had received a kidney transplant.

This is not true. So she went to another pharmacy and was erroneously told she could only receive another vaccine if her doctor's office called and verified that she had a compromised immune system.

This is also not true. Patients should only have to attest and not prove that they are immunosuppressed. But her doctor's office did call so she could be properly vaccinated.

This is also not an isolated anecdote. I specialize in leukemia and have heard similar stories from multiple patients. I have had to call pharmacies near where I practice in Miami to verify my own patients' immunocompromised status.

In reality based on emerging data from Israel and the CDC immunity appears to wane over time (particularly among older adults) and it may be that the vaccine is not as effective against certain COVID-19 variants. This was the basis for the recommendation for a booster from the Biden administration. Yet until recently the FDA in an effort to be either careful and deliberate or to dig in its heels and demonstrate that it will not be strong-armed by the president delayed recommending a booster vaccine to a broader population than just those who have compromised immune systems. That added to the mixed messaging — and further eroded public trust in medical institutions.

Based on these data and the low risk and potential large benefit of getting the jab my wife who is an infectious diseases pharmacist and I felt my healthy 86-year-old father-in-law should receive a third vaccine dose along with the over 1 million people in the U.S. who have also received an unauthorized booster shot. So did he.

But to do so at the time he would have to lie and claim that he was actually getting his first dose. Sitting in his screened-in porch we tried to prepare him for his trip to the pharmacy by play-acting the interaction he would have to ensure he would say the right thing. I pretended to be the pharmacist:

""Good morning sir"" I said. ""How can I help you today?

""I'm here for my third vaccine dose"" he answered quickly.

My wife and mother-in-law shook their heads in dismay.

""No pappy"" my wife said. ""You have to say it's your first vaccine dose.""

""I don't wanna lie"" he answered. ""I've never lied to my doctor.""

""You have to"" she insisted. ""Otherwise the pharmacy won't give the vaccine to you."" He muttered an ""okay"" and we started over.

""How can I help you?"" I repeated.

""I'm here for a shot"" he said.

""What kind of shot?"" I asked knowing that flu shots were also available.

""Oh I'll have a whiskey!"" he joked to the consternation of my wife and mother-in-law. It was funny but not funny – we were asking him to betray the contract of trust between himself and a healthcare provider for the good of his own health and he was consciously or subconsciously rebelling.

Trust in medicine has taken a hit over the past year-and-a-half as we've reacted in real time to what we've defined as truth in a quickly moving pandemic and in an era in which information is disseminated quickly.

At first masks were de-emphasized and cleaning of surfaces was stressed as being more protective of viral transmission when in fact the opposite was true. The virus was not thought to be aerosolized; now we know that it is. At many hospitals recommendations for appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) were minimized –- not based on sound epidemiologic advice or concern for the safety of healthcare workers but due to lack of supplies and perhaps even to save PPE for nonessential elective surgeries which are revenue generators. Thus despite messaging that coming to hospitals was safe for patients healthcare workers (many of whom are still not vaccinated) likely did infect patients with COVID-19.

Is it any wonder that some vaccine hesitancy can be attributed to suspicion of information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines — information provided by the same healthcare authorities who first insisted that masks weren't important?

My wife took my father-in-law to the Rite-Aid near their home and he did receive his third vaccine dose. And while we all feel comforted knowing he has a bit more protection against COVID-19 I wonder if we've damaged his relationship with his doctor in the future.

As we enter future phases of the pandemic perhaps finally reaching the point at which enough people have been vaccinated adequately or have developed immunity to protect them from COVID-19 we in healthcare will have yet more work to do.

We need to repair our relationships with our patients so they will trust us again.

An outline of a new contract between the company and the union released Sunday afternoon shows that 10100 striking UAW members will receive 10% wage increases compared to what they made earlier this year. That's up from a 5% or 6% increase that Deere offered in an earlier proposal which nine out of 10 union members rejected Oct. 10.

The company will also continue its pension program for new hires which Deere was going to cut under the prior agreement. And compared to that agreement the new proposal pays a higher rate for future retired workers. A 25-year employee would see an extra $150 a month.

The company also added lump sum payments that can reach six figures for future retired employees.

Chris Laursen a 19-year painter at Deere's Ottumwa plant and the former UAW Local 74 president said he expects to vote in favor of the contract after rejecting the Oct. 10 proposal.

""It's a hell of a lot better than what (the union) got us the first time"" he said. ""After two weeks-plus of strikes we definitely made some gains on this.""

The UAW's members will vote on the contract at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Union leaders said in a statement that Deere workers will remain on strike at least through the contract ratification.

The contract represents workers at 12 Deere locations in Illinois Iowa and Kansas. The Iowa plants include factories in Ankeny Davenport Dubuque Ottumwa and Waterloo. The UAW also represents Deere workers in Colorado and Georgia under a separate contract.

The strike which began Oct. 14 is the first that the UAW has called against Deere since 1986. The action came as the company celebrates record profits with executives expecting Deere to earn $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion for the fiscal year that ends Monday. CEO John May's pay increased 160% in 2020 to $15.6 million.

At the same time several UAW members said they felt the company owed them big raises after they worked through the COVID-19 pandemic with executives telling them they were ""essential"" employees. The strike also comes as Deere and other manufacturers struggle to find enough workers.

The lowest level Deere employees covered in the contract such as foundry product would see their hourly wages immediately increase from $20.12 to $22.13. The highest level workers such as electricians would see hourly wages rise from $30.04 to $33.05.

The company will also give workers 5% raises in 2023 and 2025 and Deere will reinstate quarterly cost of living adjustments that workers lost in their 2015 contract. Overall UAW officials expect that workers will see a 30% increase in wages from the beginning of this year through 2027 when the contract ends.

The contract also promises lump sum payments to workers when they retire. Employees who stay with the company for 10 to 24 years will get $37500. Workers who stay at least 25 years will get $50000.

In addition Deere agreed to put another five-figure sum in an account for workers when they retire. If workers approve the new contract the company will give employees an extra $2000 for each year they've worked at the company. A 25-year worker will see an extra $50000.

Laursen the Ottumwa worker said Deere told union officials this is their ""last best offer."" If workers reject the contract he said the company has informed the union they won't be back at the table for several months.

""That's a scare tactic"" Laursen said. ""I can’t see them going without production for four or five month. Maybe they’ll bring in (nonunion workers) from down south. It’s a big enough (expletive) show when we’re in there and we know what we’re doing.""

Dave Schmelzer a 24-year quality control inspector in Milan and former UAW Local 79 chair said he expects to vote for the contract after rejecting the last one. The boosted retirement benefits sold him.

He said he is worried the majority of members will reject the contract Tuesday though. He believes some workers think Deere executives will put forth another better offer. He pointed out workers are currently taking a pay cut receiving $275 a week while on strike. He doesn't know how long they will be able to stay strong if the strike stretches through the end of this year.

""There's no guarantees that you get more if you just keep striking"" he said. ""There's a substantial loss for striking for three four months. You can’t get that back. You can't work at a high enough hourly rate to chip away on that loss. It's just gone.""

Jon Root a 16-year assembler in Waterloo said he still plans to reject the new contract Tuesday. He said Deere can afford to pay higher wages than what executives offered.

Root said he knows cashiers who make as much as some workers at the factory. He has circulated a petition among UAW members demanding across-the-board $10-an-hour pay raises. That would come out to hikes of 33% to 50%.

He said union members should be especially motivated to push for better wages because of the death of Richard Rich a Deere employee in Milan Illinois who died last week when a car hit him as he walked across the road from his picket line.

""We want (better) pay"" Root said ""or that union member died for nothing. The whole country is looking to us to set the new standard for skilled assembly labor.""

That strike will continue until members ratify the deal. Deere & Co. also confirmed the agreement on a new 6-year labor contract.

“Our UAW John Deere national bargaining team went back to our local members after the previous tentative agreement and canvassed the concerns and priorities of membership.” said UAW President Ray Curry. “We want to thank the UAW bargaining team and striking UAW members and their families for the sacrifices they have made to achieve these gains. Our members have enjoyed the support of our communities and the entire labor movement nationwide as they have stood together in support and solidarity these past few weeks.”



Chuck Browning UAW Vice President and Director of the Agricultural Implement Department said the agreement contains enhanced economic gains and continues to provide the highest quality healthcare benefits in the industry. “The negotiators focused on improving the areas of concern identified by our members during our last ratification process.”



The UAW will not release details of the Tentative Agreement until members at all John Deere locations have an opportunity to meet and review the terms of their proposed contract.

Members should reach out to their local unions for more information about the time and location of meeting and subsequent ratification votes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rd3dsLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RvcC1zdG9yaWVzL3VwZGF0ZS12b3RlLXNldC1mb3Itbm92LTItb24tbmV3LWFncmVlbWVudC1iZXR3ZWVuLWRlZXJlLWFuZC11YXcvYXJ0aWNsZV8yNjA4NzMzNi0zOTljLTExZWMtOGM2MS00N2E1NGFiNmEyYjEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATE: Vote set for Nov. 2 on new agreement between Deere and UAW,UPDATE: Vote set for Nov. 2 on new agreement between Deere and UAW,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2pvaG4tZGVlcmUtcmVhY2hlcy1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1sYWJvci11bmlvbi1mb2xsb3dpbmctc3RyaWtl0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvam9obi1kZWVyZS1yZWFjaGVzLWFncmVlbWVudC13aXRoLWxhYm9yLXVuaW9uLWZvbGxvd2luZy1zdHJpa2UuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Deere reaches agreement with labor union following strike,"Following a strike from employees John Deere has announced it has reached a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW) for a new labor contract.

While the agreement must receive approval from UAW workers to take effect John Deere officials said in an emailed statement that the agreement would last six years for the union’s ""10100 production and maintenance employees at 12 facilities in Iowa Illinois and Kansas.""

JOHN DEERE STRIKE: WHAT TO KNOW

The statement also noted that Deere and the UAW also ""reached a tentative agreement on a new six-year labor agreement covering nearly 100 production and maintenance employees at Deere parts facilities in Denver and Atlanta.""

Earlier this month UWA members walked off the job at John Deere plants in several states after rejecting the agriculture equipment giant's latest contract offer which included 5% raises for some workers and 6% raises for others with 3% raises in 2023 and 2025.

John Deere spokeswoman Jennifer Hartmann told FOX Business that while ""reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with the UAW"" is important the company's ""immediate concern is meeting the needs of our customers who work in time-sensitive and critical industries such as agriculture and construction.""

Deere workers who went on strike pointed to the company's record profits and argued that their dedication and hard work throughout the COVID-19 pandemic should earn them more than what their employer brought to the table last week with more than 90% rejecting the original tentative deal.

ATLANTA (KABC) -- A Delta Airlines passenger was arrested Friday morning at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport after he fought another passenger on a plane headed to Los Angeles according to local police.

Curtis Maurice Clayton 30 was arrested on charges of battery and interference with government property the Atlanta Police Department said in a news release.

Police said the fight began when Clayton started to argue with German Montez the man sitting behind him on the plane. Clayton allegedly became upset over Montez placing something in the pocket of his seatback and a dispute escalated into a fight.

Video of the fight which is now the subject of an investigation showed two men scuffling in the aisle as a few people tried to stop the brawl. One of the men appeared to have blood on his face.

The attack on an American Airlines flight attendant who was allegedly assaulted by a passenger on a flight bound for Southern California was unprovoked a source familiar with the investigation says.

Clayton was restrained by a passenger according to the news release.

Police said Clayton was ""uncooperative"" with officers and damaged a police vehicle during the investigation.

The incident is the latest in an alarming spike in disorderly behavior among passengers on flights since the start of the pandemic.

Earlier this week a flight from New York to Orange County was diverted to Denver after a man allegedly assaulted an American Airlines flight attendant.

Delta Air Lines announced that SkyMiles frequent flier program members who are also registered for Transportation Security Administration (TSA) PreCheck will be able to drop their bags go through security and board their plane simply by showing their face beginning next month. In other words they can go from curb to gate hands- and device-free.

“Our target here is 30 seconds” Delta’s managing director of airport experience Greg Forbes said in a press conference a TechCrunch article reports. “The way that we’re going to get there is not only through the use of technology the fact that there’s no choreography — you don’t have to launch the app or look for your driver’s license [but because] we’re also gathering together people who travel very similarly.”

The announcement comes just ahead of what some analysts predict will be the busiest travel period since the COVID-19 pandemic began. For instance for the Thanksgiving holiday period Delta expects to fly up to 5.9 million passengers which is still below the 6.3 million passengers who flew with Delta during the same period in 2019.

How The Process Works

Passengers flying direct to an international destination on Delta — or its partners Aeromexico Air France KLM Korean Air or Virgin Atlantic — have been able to use facial recognition technology from curb-to-gate since 2019 because the airlines can rely on U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s federal passport database for facial image matching. The problem until now for domestic travel is that many passengers rely on a driver’s license as their form of ID – and those photos reside on databases managed by individual states rather than on a central database.

Delta has partnered with the TSA to address that issue and create what it calls the “Delta-TSA PreCheck express lobby and bag drop.” The key is that passengers use a so-called digital identity – which includes their SkyMiles member number passport details and Known Traveler Number – using the Fly Delta app when checking in.

Here’s how it works. First after checking in on the app passengers will walk up to the dedicated bag-drop area and complete a hands-free facial scan.

After the system validates their identity in the TSA’s database the machine will print a baggage label. Next the passenger attaches the label to their baggage and places the bag on the automated conveyor belt.

The next step is for the passenger to walk to security where they can again use a facial scan to pass through the domestic checkpoint in the dedicated TSA PreCheck lanes. This step replaces the need to provide a passport government ID or boarding pass.

Finally when it’s time to board the plane passengers will once again use a facial scan instead of producing a boarding pass.

“In trying out the experience firsthand the promise of a 30-second bag drop seemed quite achievable” the TechCrunch writer explained. “The facial recognition with the mask briefly removed takes a few seconds. Attaching the luggage tag probably took longer than anything else.”

Privacy Concerns

Of course not everyone is completely at ease with the use of biometrics especially by non-government companies or agencies. Or perhaps by the government as well for that matter. However Delta does note that it doesn’t touch or save any of the biometric data.

When asked on Good Morning America about privacy issues Ranjan Goswami Delta’s senior vice president of customer experience admitted that it is a valid concern for passengers and further explained the process.

“First we aren’t storing any photographic imagery at all. All we do is take your photo” Goswami said. “And because you’ve uploaded your passport number as part of your Delta profile we just take that passport number and that picture. We just check it against the customs database from your passport photo.”

But the airlines aren’t entirely out of the woods: Both would have reported losses were it not for federal pandemic aid.

Still the financial results released on Thursday show that the industry is on the mend as travel steadily resumes and both American and Southwest said they expected to do even better in the final three months of the year lifted by corporate international and holiday travel.

“We made good progress in our pandemic recovery in third quarter 2021 and I expect more in fourth quarter” Gary Kelly Southwest’s chief executive said in a statement. “I’m very excited about the demand recovery and our prospects for 2022.”

Southwest reported a profit of $446 million for the third quarter with revenue of $4.7 billion. The Delta variant robbed the airline of an estimated $300 million in revenue over the summer but Southwest also suffered from operational challenges including a three-day stretch of widespread flight delays and cancellations in June that was echoed this month."

For: Bowen Chan 13 HKCCCU Logos Academy

Almost everyone in Hong Kong is experiencing the economic pain brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.

In 2020 Hong Kong’s economy shrank by 6.1 per cent – the biggest annual contraction on record.

The city’s tourism industry was hit particularly hard and consumer spending had dropped significantly.

How helpful is the voucher scheme really?

Therefore the government said it would issue HK$5000 worth of consumption vouchers to boost the local economy.

However only residents aged above 18 would be allowed to apply for the scheme which was launched in July this year.

If the government’s aim is to make people spend more to help speed up the city’s economic recovery all permanent residents regardless of age should be entitled to the e-vouchers.

What’s more is the scheme being fair to families with children in Hong Kong? Under the current eligibility rules a struggling single parent with two children receives the same amount as a childless millionaire.

Raising children is costly. The HK$5000 voucher can really help those families buy their daily necessities while providing extra cash to spend on shopping or other activities.

Also the vouchers can help teenagers learn money management with the guidance of their parents.

How our readers would spend HK$5000

According to a 2020 survey conducted by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants involving local students from Primary Four to Secondary Three 84 per cent of the 1015 respondents said they have saving habits but only 35 per cent have the habit of tracking their expenses.

Hence expanding the e-voucher scheme to cover all Hong Kong permanent residents would be beneficial in so many ways for the city’s overall development.

Against: Serene Chan 15 Fukien Secondary School

Covid-19 brought the global economy to its knees. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po launched many programmes to increase public spending levels during the economic downturn.

One of them is the HK$5000 consumption voucher scheme which is expected to give a strong boost to many businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The city’s economy has improved this year so some people say that the e-vouchers should be expanded to cover all Hong Kong permanent residents regardless of their age. I don’t agree.

Many stores held sales to encourage people to shop and spend money at their businesses. Photo: SCMP/ Felix Wong

To begin with most minors are unaware of their roles and responsibilities. Hence children and younger teenagers without financial experience would not be able to spend their money wisely. Another problem with the expanded scheme is that the government would not be able to afford it. The authorities already have a lot on their hands including providing more housing and jobs to the people.

To solve the housing shortage Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has proposed the “Northern Metropolis” plan which is expected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars.

Also we should not forget low-income families and the jobless in Hong Kong. The government gives them millions of dollars every year so they can meet their basic needs.

Which is better: cash handouts or e-vouchers?

Then there are public services such as building infrastructure and providing top-class medical services for the public.

The government has a lot of money but it has to be careful with its spending.

Though it may look attractive to some people expanding the consumer vouchers scheme to all permanent residents is not a good idea – it wouldn’t help the government or the people in Hong Kong. The authorities should come up with better plans to respond to the current situation.",,,,,,,,,

CHARLOTTE N.C. — With inflation pushing prices higher every dollar counts. And with high unemployment leaving millions of people out of work many people are making trips to the dollar store to find a bargain. But are they really getting a good deal?

These are complicated times. With labor shortages and demand issues holding up the supply chain shopping is getting more expensive. Is it worth it to poke around affordable chains like Dollar General and Dollar Tree? The answer is actually yes and no and it depends on what you're looking for.

Stores that promise big savings really do deliver. A recent study from Consumer Reports compared the deals by purchasing items at both dollar stores and big-name grocery stores. The results were clear: Dollar stores are cheaper.

“At Consumer Reports we had secret shoppers around the county go in and look for 12 items and for every one of those shoppers when compared to a local grocery store the dollar store returned the lower overall price"" Brian Vines who wrote the article for Consumer Reports said.

Here's where,"A 1.2-mile stretch of land on the south side of State Road 200 is poised to become a multi-family housing mecca with developers planning 728 townhome duplex and apartment units to meet growing workforce housing demands.

So far one of three plans has cleared the Marion County Commission which makes final decisions on planning and zoning issues. The volunteer Marion County Planning & Zoning Board recently recommended approval of the two other complexes.

This means the south side of SR 200 from just west of Chest Pain Heart Center (across from where Southwest 80th Street connects to the northside of SR 200) westward to Southwest 95th Street Road is poised to become mostly multi-family housing.

In all developers plan to build 498 townhomes/duplexes and 230 apartments on 144 acres along or just south of that 1.2-mile stretch of SR 200.

Marion growth: SE 135th St. residents balk at land owner's second pitch for development

SE Ocala:Townhouse complex on 20 acres south of SE 31st Street approved

SW Marion growth:P&Z board gives OK to 182-home development south of SW 103rd Street Road

Apartments and townhomes are slated on 95 acres beside and behind to the northeast of the new Circle K at the Southwest 95th Street Road intersection across SR 200 from Aldi and Lowe's. About 33 of those acres must still be approved by the commission.

Then there are 49 acres about mile west of Southwest 60th Avenue that recently cleared the first change-in-zoning hurdle to build 312 townhomes on property that also borders a portion of Marion Landing.

These are the latest in a series of multi-family developments across Marion County including others south of Belleview along Maricamp Road in Ocala and along County Road 484 near Interstate 75.

The mad dash to build multi-family complexes comes because of Marion County's business building boom. The boom has been focused on logistics and distribution centers though includes all kinds of businesses.

For a decade Marion County officials have known of a housing shortage especially of multi-family units. Now that Marion is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation with hundreds of large distribution businesses now popping up the need is now.

Kevin Sheilley president and CEO of the Ocala Metro Chamber & Economic Partnership has said numerous times that the arrival of large distribution warehouses such as for Amazon AutoZone FedEx Dollar Tree and others has showcased that need.

Rolling Hills changes initial plans

Last year a 49-acre parcel along the State Road 200 Corridor was cleared to possibly become a large ""big box"" shopping center with restaurants up front on lots along that stretch of SR 200.

The acreage from near Chest Pain Heart Center to the entrance to Sun Country Estates has about 2000 feet of frontage.

The eastern property line is about 1000 feet west of the Chest Pain Heart Center which is located about a quarter of a mile west of Southwest 65th Avenue Road and the entrance to the Marion Landing retirement community.

The property is owned by Rolling Hills of Ocala and J. B. Gadinsky. The piece of property is shaped like a triangle missing one small tip.

The eastern property line along SR 200 is about 500 feet west of where Southwest 80th Street dead-ends from the north into SR 200 across and to the west from where the Kwik King convenience store.

The western property line on SR 200 is located at Southwest 69th Court Road at the entrance of Sun Country Estates which is across SR 200 from Joy Evangelical Lutheran Church.

Back in 2011 developers had planned to build a shopping center with a 174550-square-foot main building. The plan shows seven other smaller attached retail spots totaling another 170000 square feet.

There were also five out-parcels along SR 200 that would be aimed at other restaurants and retailers. Officials said the development team has been working with county officials to update the 2011 plan.

Last week the developer came back with a new plan. Instead of a large box retail store the plan is to build 312 townhome units off the highway and 444312 square feet of commercial space fronting SR 200.

The P&Z board ruled 7-0 to recommend approval. The issue was on the consent agenda since the development did not draw any opposition. Documents show that 104 residents living 300 feet from the development were contacted by letter.

West Shire Village II clears first hurdle

The P&Z board also heard from the developers of West Shire Village which announced its second phase of its multi-family housing project.

In recent months developer Stark Enterprises received the go ahead from the commission to build 230 apartment units on 62 acres.

That multi-family development is planned along State Road 200 on acreage south or behind Big Sun Realty. It will be located southeast behind the new Circle K at Southwest 95th Street Road.

Approved:Huge apartment/quadraplex/commercial development planned off US 441 South in Summerfield

Denied:After Villagers grouse county rejects upscale apartment complex planned for south Marion

Uncertain:841-home development proposed north of SummerGlen

That acreage could only be accessed by Southwest 73rd Terrace a tree-lined dead-end country road that heads north and connects to SR 200 across the highway from the sales office of Triple Crown Homes Inc.

The developer was limited to 100 apartments until it could get a second access along Southwest 95th Street Road. Well the second phase called West Shire Village II will solve its access issues.

The P&Z board recommended approval for Stark Enterprises to build 186 townhome units on 33 acres that front Southwest 95th Street Road east of the new Circle K. That property allows for connectivity of phase one to Southwest 95th Street Road.

Combined West Shire Village I and II will feature 416 multi-family housing units (230 apartments and 186 townhomes) on 95 acres. Residents leaving the development to north on SR 200 via Southwest 73rd Terrace will only be able to make a right turn.

The developer is planning to keep many of the trees on the wooded acreage and include nature paths in phase one. Building heights are also limited to two stories. Each apartment unit will have an adjoining porch rear patio space documents state.

Amenities for phase one will ""include clubhouse with party room leasing offices work space outdoor grilling eating area pool and outdoor lounge area"" documents state.

Documents state that the apartments will also have ""multi-sport court for pickleball volleyball tennis and basketball"" as well as a playground; dog park with benches ""in a wooded area with picnic tables; and a centralized covered mail kiosk.""

The new project will be an extension of the recently approved West Shire Village county documents state.

""The plan proposes a combination of 2- 4- and 6-unit multiple-family structures that will be a mix of 1- and 2-stories and all residential units will include 2-car garages"" according to the plan submitted to the county.

The smaller amenity center in West Shire Village II will include a picnic pavilion and playground and residents of both sections will have access to the larger amenity complex.

A major access point on Southwest 95th Street Road will be located at an existing and planned median opening county documents state.

""The applicant provided a preliminary traffic study that indicates overall capacities are available; however as the project is established supporting operational improvements are anticipated including providing a left-turn-lane into the site’s main SW 95th Street Road access"" the county document states.

The final traffic study will require review and approval. Stark will now take its plan to the commission for final approval later this month possibly Nov. 17. There was no opposition from eight property owners who live within 300 of the property.

Should there be retail choice for natural gas? The developers of a proposed natural gas-fired merchant electricity plant are testing the waters with a proposal to bypass their local monopoly supplier by building their own one-customer pipeline to another source.

In the electricity arena this is an old issue as large industrial or commercial uses have agitated for the right to seek lower-cost competitive suppliers to Dominion Energy Virginia or Appalachian Power Company. The battle has raged at the General Assembly and in front of the State Corporation Commission.

Under state law a large-enough customer can opt out of the monopoly power company under certain conditions. Similar mega-customers exist in the natural gas arena but there is no comparable provision in state code allowing them to choose alternative gas suppliers.

The proposed Chickahominy Power LLC plant in Charles City County which will also be ready to burn hydrogen to produce electricity if and when hydrogen is available for that has many certificates and permits it needs from the state. The war on fossil fuels crowd did its best to block the permits but has failed so far.

It also has a wholesale market for the 1650 megawatts of electricity it will produce and in general the expansion of merchant generation not built and controlled by the monopoly utilities is considered an economic boon. The 2020 Clean Energy Economy Act among many other things will require the use of more purchased power agreements by the utilities.

What Chickahominy lacks at this point is an agreement with Virginia Natural Gas service which might require a new 24-mile connection. This was to be one of two such plants in Charles City served by a planned expansion of the VNG pipeline in Virginia but that project was mobbed by environmental opposition and abandoned by the utility last year.

The tremor reported about 6:30 p.m. Thursday registered 2.1 in magnitude. It was about five miles from Jenkinsville in Fairfield County.

It was the third one identified by geologists Thursday and at least the fifth this week in the Jenkinsville area home to Lake Monticello and the VC Summer nuclear power plant.

No damage was reported from the quake but the state S.C. Emergency Management Division is trying to learn more about the cause a spokesman said. So far answers have been elusive.

""What we are being told is this is normal"" said Derrec Becker a spokesman for the emergency division. He noted that ""seismologists are looking into it further. Any number of reasons could cause earthquakes like this.""

Becker said ""there's always a reason to be prepared for earthquakes in South Carolina"" noting that major earthquakes have been recorded in the past including a devastating quake in the Charleston area in the late 1800s.

""Low magnitude quakes like this I would be surprised if somebody could feel it"" Becker said.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey South Carolina has registered at least five earthquakes in the Jenkinsville area since Monday all below 2.5 a relatively low magnitude.

Scientists and state officials said Friday it is not possible to say if the small tremors foreshadow a larger quake but small quakes that occur in clusters are not necessarily unusual. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be triggered by human activity such as drilling or other things that change pressure beneath the ground experts say.

""You see these throughout the eastern U.S."" said Tom Pratt a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Virginia.

Earthquakes of a magnitude less than 2.5 are typically not noticeable to the average person but are picked up by a specialized piece of equipment called a seismograph Michigan Technological University reports.

Major earthquakes around the world have often been at magnitudes of 8 or higher according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

No damage has previously been reported at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant said Dominion Energy the plant's owner. The plant also is currently offline for refueling.

""There has been no impact to the V. C. Summer Nuclear site on any of the reported earthquakes"" spokesman Darryl Huger said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluaW9ucG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8zMC9iZW5qYW1pbi1tdXJyYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Benjamin Murray,"Benjamin “Ben” Robert Murray Sr. 84 of Morgantown passed away Oct. 22 2021 surrounded by family at his home in Leesburg Fla.

Phil Mickelson might have a new biggest fan. Twitter | @BuffaloBills

By the time the 2021 NFL season is over Josh Allen may well be the league MVP. But after Sunday there’s no question about it he’s also the owner of the league’s Most Valuable Costume.

Before his game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday Allen celebrated Halloween in style only a golfer could love. The Buffalo Bills’ neophytic young quarterback dressed up as Phil Mickelson sending the internet into a tizzy and even prompting a response from the man himself.

It all started this morning when Allen moseyed his way into the locker room in traditional fashion spare for his outfit. Instead of his traditional pregame suit-and-tie Allen sported a slightly more … casual look as he entered the Bills home stadium in Orchard Park. The 25-year-old wore khaki shorts a light blue golf shirt sunglasses and a visor. He also carried a Thermos which he used to gesture toward the camera.

Upon closer inspection (and after an all-too-familiar thumbs-up) Allen’s costume was revealed: he was dressed as none other than Phil Mickelson. In the short clip which made rounds on social media on Sunday morning Allen can be seen showcasing his calves for the camera and sporting a visor with the Kiawah Island logo attached a nod to Lefty’s thrilling win at the PGA Championship in May.

Before long Mickelson himself was among those responding to the video sharing his thoughts in a series of tweets.

“Josh Allen just became the most seductive man on the planet” Mickelson said cheekily at first before tweeting again a few minutes later.

“I find this new version of Josh Allen so seductive and yet I can’t quite put my finger on what exactly it is” Mickelson continued. “GoBills.”

I find this new version of Josh Allen so seductive and yet I can’t quite put my finger on what exactly it is 🤔

GoBills 😂😂 https://t.co/Vf84zP9p78 — Phil Mickelson (@PhilMickelson) October 31 2021

It’s not clear when Mickelson and Allen met for the first time though the two athletes have been active on each other’s social media handles over the last several months. Of course Allen is an avid golfer who has competed in various pro-am events over the years including the American Century Championship in Tahoe and Phoenix Open.

On Sunday his Buffalo Bills will look to move to 5-2 on the 2021 season with Allen at the helm while Mickelson will enjoy another week off after a T47 finish at last week’s Dominion Energy Classic of the Champion’s Tour."
DPZ,Dominos,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vY29udGVudC9iZXN0LXBob3RvLXByaW50aW5nLXNlcnZpY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Tried 4 Online Photo-Printing Services—Here's the One I'd Trust With My Baby Book,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

I am 1000 percent what one would call a photo hoarder. I document thoroughly and I never delete. However beyond the select few that make it onto Instagram these images solely live on my phone (and in the cloud I hope?). They appear in random pop-up alerts that remind me what I was doing four years ago and nothing more.

I would have happily gone on functioning this way forever—until I had a kid. I so clearly remember digging through boxes of family photos as a child poring over images of my parents as a young couple or my older brother as an infant. Two years into being a mama myself it’s become urgent that I start building my stockpile of physical photo memories so my daughter can have an experience similar to mine. But there are many many options out there: subscription-based services photo books/strips/magnets/calendars and prints of all different sizes. In an effort to parse these vast and varied offerings I placed orders from four online photo companies: Artifact Uprising Chatbooks Mootsh and Social Print Studio. Here’s what I found—the good the bad the ones I’ll keep going back to.

Courtesy of Artifact Uprising

What it offers: With standout details like linen-covered books and metallic foil stamping Artifact Uprising is by far the most luxe and comprehensive option of the bunch—even the packaging of its products feels gift-worthy. The company’s range includes a little bit of everything: standard prints (available in 11 sizes and three paper types) large-format prints (up to 60-by-40 inches) books calendars and cards.

Good to know: While ordering prints is super-straightforward making a book with them is a little more complicated—mostly due to the extensive level of customization that’s available (which could be a good thing if that’s what you’re in the market for). If you have the time and want to control every little detail it’s a great option. However if minimal effort is more your speed this might not be your ideal resource.

Best for: Prints of every size gift giving highly customizable options. I’ll be turning to AU for special projects like the wedding album I never made and our annual holiday card—and for highly giftable items such as The Story of You baby book.

Tip: If you’re ordering anything other than the standard prints the website is easier to navigate than the app.

Prices: 10 prints (4-by-6 inches) for $14; 30-page hardcover book (7-by-7 inches) for $62.

Courtesy of Chatbooks

What it offers: This brand is all about the photo book—from one-off special-occasion versions to its monthly subscriptions—with an emphasis on chronology. Choose from small-scale books (5-by-7 inches 30 pages) dedicated to each month or bigger books (up to 10-by-10 inches 30 to 366 pages) meant to document a full year. When your photos load on the Chatbook app they’re ordered by date taken and separated by month (I found this super-helpful when pulling together an album based on my daughter’s first year). Another hallmark: Its fun array of cover options including limited-edition collaborations with designers like Meera Lee Patel and Ampersand Design Studio. Additionally it does stock a limited assortment of non–photo-book items—5-by-5-inch prints canvas wall tiles and holiday cards—but I wouldn’t say they’re the star of the show.

Good to know: I found the app super user-friendly so I was able to make a book very quickly on my phone. The editing options are somewhat limited (and therefore not intimidating) which was a plus in my mind—less to hem and haw over. With minimal effort I was able to create a collection of memories that I know my family will enjoy having around—and via a process that seems realistic to keep up with on a monthly basis. Is the finished product something that speaks to my design aficionado side? Not especially but for me ease of use wins in this case.

Best for: Not-too-precious chronological photo books that can be made quickly—for when done is better than perfect. I’ll be keeping my Monthbook subscription for general family photos and adding a Monthly Mini subscription—a 5-by-5-inch 30-page softcover that’s perfect for tiny hands (and only $5 per month)—so my little one can get in on the fun.

Prices: 10 prints (5-by-5 inches) for $5; 30-page hardcover book (8-by-8 inches) for $25 plus free standard shipping on all orders.

Courtesy of Mootsh

What it offers: A monthly photo-print subscription—plain and simple. For $16 per month you get 10 prints (choose from five sizes ranging from 3.75-by-5 inches to 5-by-7) plus a dated contact sheet. The whole set arrives housed in a sturdy patterned envelope that’s great for safekeeping and easy organization.

Good to know: I was skeptical about a subscription that requires me to put in any legwork. However the process is so straightforward I’ve found it to be more of a benefit than a hindrance—it keeps me accountable and on top of ordering which is exactly what I need. While you can add extra prints to your monthly allotment for 85 cents each I enjoy the exercise of choosing each month’s top 10 moments. I find the patterned envelopes that the photos arrive in to be charming but I’m not sure that the designs have a wide-reaching appeal.

Best for: Standard prints delivered regularly. I’ll be renewing my subscription—for me this is the ideal way to keep up with regularly printing photos.

Price: 10 prints (4-by-6 inches) for $16 plus free shipping.

Courtesy of Social Print Studio

What it offers: Choose from an extensive range of products—everything from classic prints and photo books to novelty items like stickers and magnets. Standouts include its photo strips a photo booth–style row of four images and a daily calendar a 3-inch-tall tear-off block that you can customize with 365 photos.

Good to know: The print quality is excellent—it’s a smooth matte finish on thick archival-quality card stock. Two thumbs-up on that front. And the studio makes some fun items that you won’t find anywhere else as in I’m a sucker for a photo booth so this DIY version is a big draw for me. However I ran into hiccups using both the website and the app—neither was a super-fluid experience. If that’s something you can look past (or just power through like I did—because I need that daily calendar) then this might be the option for you.

Best for: Standard prints and fun specialty items. I’ll be reordering the photo strips any time I have a series of images that just beg to be grouped together.

Prices: 24 prints (4-by-6 inches) for $18; 38-page hardcover book (7-by-8.5 inches) for $33 plus free shipping on orders over $50.

What I Learned

Make folders on your phone for the services you use and add your favorite images (or those that align with a specific project you’re working on) in real time or at the end of each day. If you’re able to edit them—making any necessary brightening/color-correcting changes—before adding them to those folders even better! Then when it comes time to place an order or add the images for a monthly subscription you’ll have your very best ready to use with minimal effort.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvZG9taW5vcy1zb3V0aC1rb3JlYS1oYWxsb3dlZW4tcGFja9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS9hbXAvdHJlbmRzL2RvbWlub3Mtc291dGgta29yZWEtaGFsbG93ZWVuLXBhY2s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spooky Halloween-Themed Pizzas,"The Domino's South Korea Halloween Pack Includes Two Pizzas

KITTS October 29 2021 (MMS-SKN) — When two former champion teams of Constituency Number Seven Dr the Hon Timothy Harris Domino League met Thursday evening October 28 at the new Lodge-Ottley’s Community Centre in the tenth segment of play in the 26th edition of the league the presumed underdog carried the day.

Unity Domino Club and Lodge Domino Club are arguably the most experienced teams each having been the Constituency Number Seven Domino League champion team at different times in recent years. When they met on Thursday Unity came with an added advantage over Lodge as it is the runaway points standing leader.

Lodge showed scant respect for their perennial adversaries by opening the game on a high note at one time leading 6-2. Unity players rallied up and in the process reduced the deficit to a level where Lodge led 12-10. Noting wanting to lose a game that was theirs for the taking the pair of O’Niel Thomas and Edison Parris slammed the brakes on their opponents and handed them a100-0 points whitewash in the final game a feat that earned them a bonus game for a 14-10 overall win.

A similar scenario came into play when the only two teams from Constituency Number Six faced each other. Former champion team Parsons Domino Club came over with a higher seeding as they held the second position on the points standing table while Saddlers Domino Club was in the eighth position on the same table.

However Saddlers turned the tables on their sister team from Number Six and handed Parson a narrow 13-11 beating.

Defending champion team Tabernacle Domino Club which has not being doing very well also caused a mini-upset as they too were expected to succumb at the hands of Christ Church Domino Club which was at that time in fourth position on the points standing table. Tabernacle ended up beating Christ Church 13-10.

Sylvers Domino Club the only team captained by a female – Octavia Huggins-Sewell – exhibited little or no mercy when they handsomely stopped Unstoppable Domino Club 13-6.

In other games Phillips Domino Club beat Ottley’s Domino Club 14-8; Mansion Domino Club beat Guinness Domino Club 13-8; and Molineux Domino Club edged out Small Corner Bar Domino Club 13-10.

Despite the loss at the end of the tenth segment of play in the 26th edition of Constituency Number Seven Dr the Hon Timothy Harris Domino League former champion team Unity is still firmly at the top on the points standing table with 48 points. It is followed by their Thursday evening’s tormentors Lodge who have 38 points Parsons 37 Points Phillips 36 points and Christ Church 33 points.

Others in order are Molineux 31 points Mansion 31 points Saddlers 30* points Sylvers 30 points Tabernacle 25* points Guinness 21 points Small Corner Bar 19 points Unstoppable 16 points and Ottley’s 12 points.

Defending champion team Tabernacle Domino Club and Saddlers Domino Club have one outstanding game which ended up in dispute on Tuesday. The league’s Executive Committee will hold an arbitration meeting on Monday November 1 in an attempt to defuse the impasse.

Constituency Number Seven Dr the Hon Timothy Harris Domino League which is the longest running such league in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis is sponsored by Prime Minister and Area Parliamentary Representative for St. Christopher Seven Dr the Hon Timothy Harris.

Eleventh segment of play in this only round of play in the 26th edition of the league plays off on Tuesday November 2 at the new Lodge-Ottley’s Community Centre. Defending champion team Tabernacle will meet bottom on the points standing table Ottley’s while current leader on the points standing table Unity with face off with Saddlers.

Other games will be Molineux vs. Christ Church; Parsons vs. Sylvers; Phillips vs. Small Corner Bar; Mansion vs. Lodge; and Guinness vs. Unstoppable.",,,,,,

If the colors that apparel retailers choose for their latest lines often aren't to your liking or by the time they hit the store shelves seem behind the latest trends on the sidewalks or on social media a solution may be coming sooner than you imagined. By next year Ralph Lauren flagship stores may have the textile coloring technology to let shoppers have the blank slate of cotton polo shirt dyed in-store. Chemicals giant Dow  a major player in textile dyes has been working with Ralph Lauren on new processes for cotton dyeing that reduce use of chemicals water and energy intensity. ""Ralph Lauren obviously is a big user of cotton and to dye textiles it takes a lot of chemicals and a lot of water and you generate a lot of waste and mainly you do that because you're trying to use heat and pressure to put that dye into the fabric"" Dow CEO Jim Fitterling said last Thursday at the CNBC ESG Impact summit. Trillions of liters of water for example are used for fabric dyeing which is equal to 20% of the world's wastewater. That is one of the reasons Dow developed what it calls ECOFAST Pure announced earlier this year which to dye cotton needs up to 90% less chemicals 50% less energy and 50% less water. But the sustainability project could also have major implications for what is called experiential retail — the effort by retailers to give consumers new reasons to come into stores as e-commerce's footprint already large only grows as a result of the pandemic. Ralph Lauren's Color on Demand project uses the Dow technology to color cotton at any point in manufacturing and result in shorter lead times for making color decisions. Halide Alagöz chief product and sustainability officer at Ralph Lauren said in an announcement about the effort earlier this year that the retailer will be able to ""meet personalized consumer demands faster than ever before."" And while he didn't say it that means potentially coloring a shirt in the store. ""Ralph Lauren will be able to do something like put Color on Demand in one of their flagship stores in New York next year so that you can go in and get your Ralph Lauren polo dyed in the store"" Fitterling said at the CNBC ESG Impact event. ""That would have never been possible without this technology."" A Ralph Lauren spokeswoman said ""We look forward to sharing more about this in due course.""

The post-pandemic era of experiential retail

Coming up with new strategies to more deeply involve the consumer in the apparel production experience is not new for Ralph Lauren. It has allowed shoppers to customize colors for its iconic horse logo sewn into shirts for apparel ordered online. Other retailers such as North Face have been letting consumers pick and choose the components of jackets and have their preferences manufactured into the whole. Customization and faster fashion that embeds the individual consumer in the shopping narrative is going to play out in many ways in the retail sector. Levi Strauss & Co. CEO Chip Bergh has said the traditional sizes will be a thing of the past in fashion as 3-D body scanners and camera technology combined with much faster manufacturing will allow retailers to make clothes a unique fit for each person. Nike and Amazon both have made body-scanning technology acquisitions in recent years. Pre-pandemic every conversation in retail was about selling experiences over things and while the lockdowns may have put much that had been in the works on pause as digital became the only way to do business those strategies will now come back into focus. ""E-commerce has gained points of penetration and mindshare and will not give it back"" said Simeon Siegel retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets. ""But strong stores that made it through the pandemic are even stronger and are not likely to go away."" That means an increasing blend of e-commerce and experiential stores especially for high-profile locations. ""The store will become more experiential each and every day"" Siegel said. ""The trick is how to capitalize on it to sell more things."" Allowing a consumer to choose a color and have a piece of apparel dyed in a store could help to create the type of emotional attachment tied to a purchase that is key to retail's future. Making the consumer ""the creator"" according to Siegel ""has always been a powerful thing. Bringing the consumer into the story has always been a winning proposition."" ""People want to get back out after the pandemic"" said Ivan Feinseth chief investment officer and director of research at Tigress Financial Partners. ""Lots of ideas got shelved because of the pandemic but will come back. A good portion of retail still takes place in a store"" he said. Customization and rapid production of apparel that allows consumers to choose color is an interesting development because the process of fabric preparation has historically been toxic and only able to be done by workers wearing protection in plant settings. ""The chemicals to dye stuff the whole handling of how companies get rid of stuff ... you don't take excess dye and dump it in a sink"" he said though he added that removal of chemicals from many products such as cleaning products is becoming much more common. Dow declined to elaborate on its CEO's comments. Ralph Lauren said in its official announcement that the goal is the world's first ""scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system"" and the first phase which will be in use with traditional dyeing equipment will use up to 85% less chemicals. By 2025 it aims to use the Color on Demand platform in more than 80% of solid cotton products. The companies also announced earlier this month that they are open-sourcing the dyeing process for the textile industry.

Breakthroughs in color technology

Multiple breakthroughs in fabric coloring are underway. Digital textile printing is already changing the way consumers control color and pattern. ""The sky is the limit to what consumers can order and receive"" said Ken Butts global key account manager at Datacolor which works with retailers on the implementation of digital color solutions for their supply chains. That has been mostly limited to online companies doing it for DIY crafters and for patterns rather than solid colors on fabrics including upholstery or curtains though it is moving into apparel too. ""We're seeing companies investing in their own digital printers or print samples and the next step is printing directly for consumers"" he said. Digital printing is able to respond to consumer interest and demand quickly but it will not replace traditional dyeing any time soon because among other factors there are many fabrics which it still cannot handle. ""It doesn't mean that won't be overcome some day"" Butts said ""but your typical polo shirt it is manufactured first to look like a shirt and then dyed in the form of a shirt. You can't print it you can't twist it around in there [the printer]."" The traditional approach to dyeing a piece of clothing like a polo shirt requires an intensive process with hundreds of gallons of pigment and a significant amount of large-scale machinery which would never be feasible for a store setting but even in industrial textile facilities there are smaller machines used to test color samples. ""Anywhere in the world you find a factory dyeing fabrics on large-scale equipment thousands of pounds at a time they will have a similar piece in the lab on a small scale and that's where the manufacturer is testing their ability to make a specific color"" Butts said. ""The first step for a supplier when a retailer asks for a new color is to test it on smaller equipment."" The smaller equipment still requires chemicals and water and the end of the process will include waste disposal issues but as technology improves it is not unreasonable to foresee a future in which retailers can dye fabric in-store especially larger flagship-style stores where space is not constrained. Customers may be able to come into a store and pick a color from a palette or maybe even bring in a color with them and software will be able to translate that into the dyes required. But timing will be an issue for an in-store revolution in color-dyeing. Chemical dyeing even at its most efficient can still take as long as an hour to produce the final garment. But for both consumer and retailer that might still be better than the current process. ""Now designers are choosing a palette that will appear in a store six to nine months from now summer 2022 and trying to predict consumer trends"" Butts said. If retailers get the trend wrong that may result in a rush process of new manufacturing and transport which has high costs and by the time they get the new units they may still miss trend. ""With this you can respond to current hot trends"" he said. A consumer could come into a store with a color in mind maybe they saw someone else wearing it and within a day or two the apparel can be produced and the retailer didn't need to order 10000 shirts in advance. ""Dying fabrics to customer preferences is really exciting"" Butts said.

Sustainability and the apparel consumer

Datacolor focuses on translating colors into numerical codes that can be communicated between designers and textile manufacturers in the supply chain cutting down on the need to ship physical samples back and forth during the design process and aiding quality control efforts related to making sure the color is correct when it comes time to manufacture thousands of pieces. That is a more efficient approach to apparel production than a designer in one location sending color palettes to dye mills around the world which then have to send back fabric samples for visual review — ""back and forth until the designed finds something they like"" Butts said. But whether it is digital innovation or dyeing innovation the retail industry has a sustainability issue that will remain challenging to address. Faster communication in the design and manufacturing process and faster fashion is enticing for shoppers but a consumer turning over a wardrobe more frequently is not necessarily being more sustainable even if the underlying processes used to produce the piece require less resources and energy. And giving consumers more reason to come into stores — and potentially spend a longer time while waiting for a custom item to be finished leading to possibly even more purchases — means more consumption. ""You can eliminate all the big pigments in the machines but at the end of all of that you are still left with a garment or fabric"" Butts said. ""That question still has to be addressed. I like seeing improvements in the coloration process but we still need to address sustainability from an end-to-end view."" ""Let's face it"" Siegel said. ""In retail the most sustainable option is to not sell the item in the first place."" Manufacturing that is less harmful and less energy intensive with a lower carbon footprint is a good thing for retailers and brands but it does not address consumer waste and landfills which is why retail models are evolving in multiple ways including the focus on resale and reuse businesses such as Rent the Runway which went public last week and repurposing of items to extend the life cycle. The Ralph Lauren-Dow partnership may be novel in how its sustainability in manufacturing story can lead to a new narrative in experiential retail for the consumer but no brand has the answer to the bigger question. ""The retailers are in the business of selling more units but also in the business of improving their sustainability. The question is how to marry those two"" Siegel said. ""They need to balance a high-wire act of being better without alienating consumers convincing consumers the best thing is to walk away. And that story is yet to be written."""

One of her favorite vendors was a woman who sold crystals. So it made sense that when she found herself with more time after an accident Noa opened her own vending store Let Us Get You Stoned with her partner Kris selling crystals healing stones bracelets and much more. They started vending at Gulf Breeze Flea Market in May.

This week she found out through Facebook that the flea market will be closing its doors after this weekend and everyone who had anything on the property will have to pack up and go.

“It's definitely gonna hurt a lot of vendors who are banking on this upcoming weekend"" Noa said. ""So it's such a disappointment I found out through social media.”

Flea market owners sold the property several years ago but continued to lease the flea market space. When the Santa Rosa County School District signed a contract to purchase the property flea market managers hoped to continue to lease a portion of the land. School officials told the flea market owners last Friday however that they would not offer a lease.

The school district bought the 35 acres for almost $8.7 million and plans to build a high school and athletic facilities at the site. The property is located in Midway on U.S. 98 south of Government Drive east of Justice Circle and west of America Avenue.

For vendors who have spent decades at the market it's a hard pill to swallow.

“I've worked here for 28 years and I know them all” said Sandra Pitteklo manager of Gulf Breeze Flea Market. “I've watched their kids grow up they've raised their families and got married. It's one grubby little family.”

Pitteklo worked at the concession stands when the flea market first opened and has seen how the vendors have become almost like family.

The flea market is big enough to carry about 400 vendors and every weekend about 60 vendors come out to sell items such as candles knives woodworking comics cards and toys. It is a community of people passionate about their products who are not competitive with each other because they've built friendships over the years vendors said.

The closing of the market will have vendors banking on this weekend as the future of their shops will be in question. While the flea market is technically open until Oct. 31 vendors were told that their last day to conduct business is this weekend.

That doesn't give them much time to find new retail space and some of the vendors worry about their financial future in the meantime. Some of the vendors have already made inquiries at the Pensacola Arts Market or Stone Soup ISC in Fort Walton Beach.

Noa who has not been a vendor for long has more flexibility as she is prepared for the holidays to sell her products at the Seville market and is on the waiting list for others in downtown Pensacola. Even with these options after the holidays the future is uncertain.

""There's a tight knit community of vendors and established businesses that have been there for 20-plus years"" Noa said. ""I feel like it's really going to hurt the community because we need to try and be sustainable and buy from local shops and shop small. We're just hoping to kind of transform the way people shop but I think that there's also a lifetime of memories there.""

Just recently Noa had a young woman come up to her and tell her that her vending store inspired her to get her own booth at the flea market.

""I am worried about everybody else and how they're going to make it and we just all care about each other"" Noa said. ""But I do hope this encourages people to shop small and check out local markets because that's the best thing we can do for clients and for the climate is supporting local artists.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaXRpemVuLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL2FzaGV2aWxsZS1idW5jb21iZS1ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1ob21lcy1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1zYWxlcy10cmFuc2ZlcnMvNjE3MTkyNTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real estate sales filed in Asheville Buncombe County NC,"Staff reports

Now throw in a row of tombstones around one wall's baseboard spiderwebs hung from the ceiling and an outdoor patio occupied by glow-in-the-dark skeletons and you have a perfect stylistic amalgamation between a staple of Pensacola culture and the upcoming spooky holiday.

As much as Elbow Room prefers to go all-out for Christmas restaurant owner and operator Lesa Touchette said she found a way to compromise with the original owner Jim Flynn and add Halloween décor in the back half of the building all while he maintained the holiday was meant mainly for children.

Touchette said she took over 13 years ago and customers have asked her to celebrate Halloween the entire time she has been in charge.

""I think (Halloween) is fun. It's cool. It suits this place"" Touchette said. She added that out of respect for Flynn who died in 2016 she still will not decorate the front room of the building for Halloween.

Flynn did however donate a lone decoration for the holiday: a Ouija board which Touchette said spooked her at first though she has still come to acquaint herself with it.

One superstition that certainly lives at Elbow Room is the music. The place is filled with tunes from the likes of Ella Fitzgerald Johnny Cash and even a sprinkle of rock from the 1980s. Touchette said she thinks if music from the 1990s or later plays over the speakers the place might become haunted.

Elbow Room offers a diverse selection of entertainment outside of the bar and restaurant. Board games sit in a playfully stacked shelf in one corner and pinball and Frogger arcade machines neighbor a Star Trek character’s cardboard cutout (who currently has a Jason mask on of course).

A Star Trek video game finds itself tucked away in the back after having survived a measly two hours alive in the restaurant. And in terms of festive additions Touchette has Halloween movies playing just on the other side of a sign that reads “All ghosts welcome.”

On Saturday Touchette said she will play the movie “Halloween” since the business is closed on the actual holiday.

All the atmosphere and what Touchette described as a respectful and familial attitude from the staff and customers have created an irreplaceable bond that is immediately felt inside the building.

""It's definitely a tight-knit group"" she said. ""It's a special place that not just the employees but the customers we all share.""

Touchette said that about 10 people associated with the restaurant even have two Elbow Room-themed tattoos. One of which is of course a red light bulb.

And even if there was no original intent to decorate for Halloween at Elbow Room Touchette inadvertently created a gimmick that certainly does not give off that impression.

The Halloween decorations on the patio which was installed about a year ago were too difficult to take down according to Touchette. Instead she decided to decorate the decorations.

""Surprisingly our customers thought it was great"" Touchette said with a laugh. She said she was unsure if she wanted Halloween decorations up for another full year but as is often the case her regular customers won her over.

The Elbow Room located at 2213 W. Cervantes St. is open from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. Tuesday through Saturday.",,,

October 30 2021

By Mike Kruzman / news@whmi.com



The LACASA Center has announced its 2021 State of Michigan Changemaker Award winner.



LACASA is non-profit organization located in Livingston County that offers more than 30 programs and services for abuse victims survivors and families at no charge.



On Friday they announced that Lynette Dowler president of the DTE Energy Foundation and vice president of Public Affairs at DTE Energy is the recipient of their State of Michigan Changemaker Award. Under Dowler’s leadership the DTE Energy Foundation made a $1000000 commitment to all 45 domestic violence shelters funded by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in 2020. She said in a release that agencies like LACASA are essential to the safety and well-being of abuse victims and their families. Dowler pointed out that statistics show it is likely that “some of our very own friends family members and colleagues are victims of abuse” and that while their stories often go untold they will continue to be a loud voice for those who are often unheard.



LACASA President and CEO Bobette Schrandt said that not only has the DTE Foundation supported the mission and work of LACASA but their forward-looking actions ensured the safety and shelter of abuse victims and their children who were forced to flee their homes for fear of their lives. On behalf of abuse victims and survivors throughout Michigan Schrandt said they are honored to recognize the contributions of Dowler and the Foundation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Biology

Amidst the buzzing of honeybees and native insect pollinators the flashy colors of wildflowers and the tidy beds of carefully tended vegetables you’ll find dedicated UNC Pembroke students hard at work in the Campus Garden & Apiary. Among this cadre of students are James Locklear Abigail Canela and Kinsley Adams. As interns the garden has given each of them an outdoor education and research experience. In turn they are sharing their knowledge labor and their love for gardening with local public schools.

Indeed thanks to these students and their Biology faculty mentors Drs. Rita Hagevik and Kaitlin Campbell the grassy lawns of four elementary schools have been transformed into outdoor classrooms -- gardens alive with vegetables wildflowers herbs and pollinators. Inside these outdoor classrooms students become excited about science. They learn about the natural world and these early hands-on experiences just might encourage them to pursue careers in STEM. As Hagevik noted “Unfortunately today’s youth have become disconnected from their environment for many reasons. In elementary school one of the major topics is life cycles and gardens are perfect places to study life cycles – bees and butterflies moths and other pollinators and other animals and plants. When you use gardens to teach science you can see how all these cycles you study actually happen.”

For several years the Campus Garden & Apiary has been an outdoor classroom for Hagevik’s Kids in the Garden (KIG) Program a STEM program for middle and high school students funded by the Burroughs-Wellcome Foundation SSEP program. After Duke Energy Foundation offered to sponsor STEM outreach at UNCP the Advancement Office approached Hagevik for ideas. Inspired by her own KIG Program Hagevik collaborated with Dr. Irina Falls (School of Education) on two “Powerful Communities” grant proposals to create public school gardens that would teach STEM. Duke Energy awarded each proposal $20000. The first teacher workshop to launch the gardens was held in January 2020 and work on gardens began immediately. Unfortunately the COVID pandemic halted construction until last spring.

Today sustainable gardens at the four elementary schools (Rex-Rennert Jane Hargrave St. Pauls and Magnolia) include a greenhouse raised beds compost bins rain barrels a native bee home a shed and equipment and a weather station. Using materials purchased with grant funds Locklear spearheaded the construction of greenhouses and gardens at the schools and Canela and Adams pitched in to set up flower beds install plants and to teach school children how to plant. Hagevik offered professional development on garden-based learning in STEM and guided the sustainable organic gardens compliant with state education mandates. She also assumed management of the grants and supervision of garden interns. Campbell created classroom lessons based on pollinator life cycles and informed by her own pollinator research she selected plants for use in the gardens. Irina Falls fostered professional development including lesson plans for the teachers. Gale Sampson of the UNCP Biology Department managed purchases and paperwork.

The outdoor classrooms are having a greater impact than ever expected. Hagevik commented “we started with the goal of helping teachers to give students authentic science. Teachers realized that school gardens are more than just teaching science; they are about forming communities. They are as much as about community building as they are about teaching science.”

The schools designed their own vegetable beds using companion plantings and square foot garden techniques and they were each required to have a pollinator garden and Three Sisters (squash beans and corn) garden. Parents contributed seeds and vegetable plants and science teachers and other school staff became immersed in garden activities. Locklear said “with greenhouses and garden beds students learn food sustainability along with multiple science applications and experiences. Introducing food sustainability practices also helps expose topics such as pollinators and pollinator conservation. Conservation practices in primary and secondary [school] students would also help get students more comfortable with science practices and improve scientific knowledge as well. These types of practices bring people together to focus on solving problems where everyone's input counts. [These practices] can bring people together all races all nationalities. All the four schools are multiracial and mixed races and they bring different cultures. Giving students a chance to learn about research at an early age is very important as well especially in low-income public-school systems. From these aspects a way to bring schools and communities together and increase the love for the environment and each other is through gardening and conservation practices.""

Canela volunteered her Saturday mornings to work in the gardens at Jane Hargrave Elementary School last summer. She said the outdoor classrooms “transformed students and parents who also volunteered to come in on weekends and to take care of the garden.” Saturdays were targeted for a Migrant Education Program spearheaded by Serilda Goodwin (Migrant Education Coordinator for Public Schools of Robeson County). The program provided educational resources for families of migrant workers (many of whom speak Spanish) and offered them assistance in overcoming language barriers. According to Canela the program and outdoor classrooms “encouraged kids to grow their own food and knowledge of growing their own foods is something they can take home. It facilitated healthy relationships between kids and their food. It’s something fun for kids to do especially with the pandemic and kids having to stay at home for almost a year. That’s a long time to stay away from school. And it’s important for kids to be themselves outside.”

Amidst another year challenged by the COVID pandemic it’s encouraging that science education is alive in outdoor classrooms and these classrooms are having positive impacts on school children. Moreover UNCP garden interns helped bring these classrooms to life. Locklear summed it up by saying “When they [school children] put in plants it was beautiful. Seeing the smiles on their faces. When you can see the joy in it that helps everyone.”

McCrory eyes political comeback with Senate bid,"MOUNT AIRY N.C. (AP) — In the rankings of political upsets from November 2016 North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory's defeat was a distant second. Still when the Republican best known for signing the transgender bathroom bill narrowly lost at the same time Donald Trump comfortably won the state it left many stunned.

Now McCrory a rising star of the pre-Trump GOP is trying to mount a political comeback in a post-Trump era. McCrory is vying for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate contending with hard-right politicians who may not have had a shot several years ago and struggling to position himself amid a debate contorted by Trump's lies about the 2020 election.

The primary fight for the seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Richard Burr is one of several across the country that will test Trump's influence. The former president upended the race this summer by endorsing U.S. Rep. Ted Budd a conservative who backed his attempt to overturn the election results. That has forced McCrory to try to win over the Trump loyalists who took over the party in his absence.

That hasn't been easy for the former governor who once said Trump was “destroying democracy."" He has softened his criticism of Trump — and tried to focus his message on electability.

“I’m the candidate with the broadest appeal in the general election no ifs ands or buts” McCrory said in an interview last month with The Associated Press.

McCrory was once considered a good fit for North Carolina's shifting politics. He was viewed as a pro-business moderate — in line with many of the suburban voters driving growth in the state's expanding tech and research industries.

He spent 14 years as Charlotte's mayor before narrowly losing his first gubernatorial bid in 2008. He was then elected governor in 2012 by more than 11 percentage points. He won in part by convincing voters he was best qualified to jump-start the battered economy in a state with the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country. Having previously worked at Duke Energy and then his brother's sales consulting firm McCrory often touted his business experience.

But McCrory's career unexpectedly turned with passage of House Bill 2 legislation he signed in 2016 that required transgender people to use the public restroom of the sex listed on their birth certificate. The bill became a flashpoint in the still-burgeoning transgender rights movement.

McCrory a religious conservative defended the measure even as several large corporations and sports leagues relocated events to other states. The bill was partially repealed in 2017 by McCrory's Democratic successor Roy Cooper.

“We remember HB2 and we remember the damage that it did to our state and the loss of jobs” said Bobbie Richardson chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party. “I don’t think that people are going to forget and I know we as Democrats are not going to allow people to forget.”

McCrory now declines to say whether he regrets signing the measure. His campaign also declined to share McCrory's attitudes on a bill Republicans floated this year but ultimately did not pursue that would have prevented transgender girls and women from competing in sports designed for those who were born female.

“I don’t relive circumstances. I’m looking to the future” McCrory said.

House Bill 2 was among many factors that contributed to his narrow defeat in 2016. He also received pushback over his support for building toll lanes along Interstate 77 north of Charlotte and drew the ire of environmental activists who accused him of having a cozy relationship with Duke Energy leading up to the 2014 coal-ash spill along the Dan River.

“I gave Duke Power the largest fine in North Carolina history” McCrory said. “Duke Power was not happy with what I did.""

It took nearly a month for him to concede the election to Cooper which he did after it became clear he fell outside the 10000-vote margin needed for a statewide recount. Some of his supporters are facing a defamation lawsuit over claims they made falsely accusing a handful of voters of casting multiple ballots.

Days after his concession McCrory interviewed for a position in the Trump administration offering to provide his expertise about infrastructure and transportation. But he was rebuffed. McCrory said he later learned Trump didn't appreciate his criticism after the “Access Hollywood” video surfaced showing Trump making lewd comments about women.

McCrory says he wouldn't take it back: “I believe what I said which I said basically many of us including Mr. Trump need to have their mouth washed out with soap.""

After his defeat McCrory went on to host a popular talk radio show about politics. The show kept him in Republicans' ears but it didn't necessarily endear him to the new wave of Trump loyalists in the state.

Two days after the 2020 election McCrory pronounced his belief that Trump lost. On Nov. 23 McCrory accused Trump of “destroying democracy” through his efforts to overturn legitimate election results. The day after the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection McCrory argued that Trump lost “because of personality.""

Since announcing his candidacy this year and quitting his radio show McCrory has dialed back his criticisms of Trump.

“I was a strong defender of President Trump’s policies especially as it relates to immigration tax cuts military foreign policy” McCrory told the AP. “The only thing that I continue to be discouraged in is the deficit spending and I strongly disagree with (how) the federal government got involved in unemployment and started paying people more not to work than to work.”

McCrory was referring to boosted federal unemployment benefits the Trump administration extended during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On the campaign trail McCrory has tried to describe himself as a political outsider ready to shake up Washington — an attempt to contrast himself to Budd a three-term congressman.

Budd voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has called the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol “a few hours on one bad day."" He has since said that he accepts that President Joe Biden won fair and square.

Former Rep. Mark Walker is also in the race though he is fighting to remain viable after an abysmal fundraising period between July and September in which he brought in $122000 far less than the more than $1 million McCrory and Budd raised.

Among the Democrats running for Burr's seat are Cheri Beasley the former chief justice of the state Supreme Court and Jeff Jackson a state senator.

Many undecided voters remain torn between Budd and Walker which could boost McCrory's chances of capturing a plurality of primary votes in a three-way race.

Nancy Sieber a 70-year-old Winston-Salem resident said she can't decide between Budd or Walker.

“Obviously Trump putting his all-in for Budd is an impressionable thing to me"" she said.

But for some voters Trump's support won't be the only factor.

At a recent event where all three candidates spoke Rion Choate a Charlotte resident and member of the Mecklenburg County GOP was donning a Trump 2024 hat. He said he believes Trump defeated Biden and acknowledged Budd got Trump's endorsement but noted he supports McCrory “simply because I’ve known him all these years.”

Her husband Doc Templeton and daughter Lisa Pace Navarro were at her side.

Judy was born in Scranton on Dec. 24 1949 to Dolores Keating Gilligan Wehrum and the late John Gilligan. She grew up with two younger siblings the late Susan Gilligan Navorouski and Martin Gilligan. Her stepfather was the late John Wehrum. She earned her bachelor’s degree in chemistry at Marywood College her master’s degree at Hood College (first female graduate) and the University of Maryland and her Ph.D. in biochemistry at the George Washington University.

Most of her professional career was spent at Fort Detrick Maryland as a research chemist and department head developing countermeasures for biological warfare agents. She was extremely well-published in scientific journals and highly respected for her work in isolated liver perfusion studies. While at Fort Detrick she was the highest-ranking female in the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Later in her career she became an expert in product development and regulatory affairs. Besides negotiating the Department of Defense’s biological defense products through the maze of procedures of the Food and Drug Administration she taught two master’s-level courses: one in product development and the other in good clinical practices.

Following her retirement from the Department of the Army civil service owing to her unparalleled expertise she continued employment as a consultant.

Judy’s favorite activities included golf watercolor art jewelry-making and games of all sorts. Deep Creek Lake Maryland was one of her favorite places spending the summers at their lakefront cottage. As members of the Deep Creek Lake Sailing Association she enjoyed participating in the regattas and spending time with members of the club. Most recently Judy brought her wealth of knowledge in the field of biochemistry to serve as a member of the Medical Advisory Committee for the yacht club ably supporting the Board of Governors in managing the club’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Judy is survived by her husband Colonel (Dr.) Charles Templeton; her daughter Lisa Pace Navarro and husband Sergio; grandsons Voss and Enso Navarro; mother Dolores Keating Gilligan Wehrum; her brother and his wife Martin and Mary Barbara O’Neill Gilligan; stepchildren Cay and Jeb Templeton; and several nieces nephews and cousins.

A Mass of Remembrance for Judy will be held at 10 a.m. on Saturday Nov. 27 2021 at St. Mary of Mount Carmel Church in Dunmore. Her cremains will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. In lieu of flowers donations can be made to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.",,,,,,

The Frenchwoman won three of the awards on offer: Ride of the Year Performer of the Year and the Biggest Tow award for her wave of a lifetime at Jaws.

""It was my best season so far"" said Dupont.

""In Nazaré I got a crazy wave with Garrett McNamara who towed me. I went so fast and I could feel the explosion behind me.""

""Getting a barrel at Jaws is one of the top things to achieve. It was a really special wave. I didn't think I could set this goal for myself this winter because I thought it would be too big for me.""

For the men USA's Kai Lenny claimed both Performer of the Year and the Biggest Paddle award and was runner-up in the Ride of the Year and Biggest Tow categories.

""I remember watching all my heroes win Big Wave Awards so for me it's still a big achievement. I'm just trying to keep up and do my best!"" added Lenny.

""I think my entire season was memorable. I had some rides that will forever be ingrained in my brain.""

The awards honor surf athletes who push the boundaries of their sport and celebrate the most impressive surfing performances of the season with life-changing rewards.

The prize fund amounted to US$350000 with top prizes of $20000 going to each of the Ride of the Year winners.

The 108-year-old Broadway style touring house is famously known for having been built by 100 men in 150 working days and at one point held the distinction as having one of the largest singular steel beams ever made to top off the proscenium arch. The Playhouse also holds the distinction of being the country’s longest continuously operating Broadway touring house (pre-COVID). Famous names such as Julie Andrews Bette Davis Fred Astaire Carol Channing Christopher Plummer Abby Wambach and Sutton Foster have all graced its stage.

“We are honored to have stewarded the restoration of such a historic cultural asset in Wilmington” The Grand Executive Director Mark Fields said in a statement. “As The Grand’s sister theater these treasured community gathering spaces are important for the artistic soul of the city. The extended closure caused by the pandemic provided us a unique once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to completely renovate and redesign portions of the theater.”

The changes include new wider audience seats new paint carpets lighting and drapery and a new loading dock door which will allow The Grand to attract larger Broadway touring shows.

In tandem with these improvements building owner Buccini/Pollin Group has also been hard at work reimagining the Dupont Building with more amenities to enhance visits to the building. Ongoing improvements will include new corridor lighting and signage package that will guide building visitors to its many attractions most notably The Playhouse. Recently completed phasing includes a new bar and seating lounge adjacent to The Playhouse entry which will now be used for theater concessions as well as Currie Salon Le Cavalier at The Green Room and De.Co food hall. In all nearly 50000 square feet and $15 million of renovations were completed during COVID at the DuPont Building BPG reported.

“For more than a century The Playhouse on Rodney Square has entertained Delaware with a parade of Hollywood stars illustrious Broadway musicals and famous speakers. But in recent years the physical appearance of the theater didn’t complement the magic happening on its stage” donor Tatiana Copeland said in a statement. “Gerret and I are pleased to have provided the gift for The Grand to refresh and brighten the Playhouse during this period of extended closure. This gift not only benefits The Grand but also the audiences that enjoy performances there. We invite the community to come join us at the newly restored and beautiful Playhouse when it reopens in the fall of 2021.”

“The Grand’s renovation of the historic Playhouse on Rodney Square coincides with BPG’s ongoing renovation of the Dupont Building” commented Chris Buccini co-President of The Buccini/Pollin Group. “It is another visual representation of our partnership with The Grand and both organizations’ commitment to Wilmington’s ongoing renaissance. The Playhouse’s re-opening times perfectly with the ground floor renovations of the Hotel Du Pont lobby Le Cavalier at the Green Room the office lobby for the Chemours headquarters and the M&T Bank Branch as well as the opening of Currie Salon and Spa the apartments at 101 dupont place and DECO food hall. In all nearly 50000 SF and $15 million of renovations were completed during COVID alone to welcome back the community to heart of downtown Wilmington.”

The Playhouse on Rodney Square will be welcoming four Broadway musicals during its 2021-2022 season. The season will open in November with Sara Bareilles’ “Waitress” followed by the jukebox musical “Summer” (featuring the music of disco’s favorite Donna Summer) in December then 25th Anniversary Tour of “Riverdance” in April and closing with “Fiddler on the Roof” in June.

East Midlands Railways have responded to calls to restore full services on the line from Nottingham through to Derbyshire beauty spots after the company was threatened with being reported to the rail watchdog.

Passengers previously enjoyed an hourly service which included Saturdays on the line between Nottingham and Matlock.

Earlier this year the railway company introduced changes in which during the week services run hourly between Matlock and Derby and no longer call at Spondon Long Eaton Attenborough Beeston and Nottingham.

On a Saturday services largely now only run from Derby and Matlock on the line.

The changes follow a timetable introduced in May which hadn't performed as well as the railway company expected.

At present people travelling from Nottingham to Matlock have to change at Derby.

Sawley Parish Council has now written to the railway company demanding that the service between Long Eaton and Matlock is restored to two trains an hour.

In the letter the council warned that if the service was not restored to full capacity as promised by East Midlands Railways then the railway firm would be reported by the council to the rail ombudsman and the Department for Transport.

Labour Sawley Parish Councillor Leon Reed said: ""It's a broken promise to us they said it was a temporary measure but here we are three months later with no signs of a full service returning.

""We've gone from two trains an hour to one an hour which is not the standard of service we expect and is very frustrating.

""It ruin people's work commutes by making it more difficult to get home or get to the office and also affects people travelling for tourism or leisure.

""Also trains have been packed since the change with basically two trains of people cramming into one and not that many people wearing masks it could be a real safety issue.

""It is affecting the community negatively as the now required change at Derby train station adds time and inconvenience to the journey and creates a barrier for those with mobility issues making people do a previously unnecessary change.""

The council warned that if service was not resumed then they would contact the rail ombudsman and the Department for Transport to make a formal complaint as well as requesting that other local authorities take similar action.

It comes after passengers spoke out in June saying they were ""absolutely gutted"" direct train services on the route had been reduced.

A spokesperson for East Midlands Railway said: “We are progressing the Operational Delivery Improvement Plan which was put in place following the challenging performance earlier this year after our May timetable change was affected by the impact of Covid staff absences and the late delivery of trains.

“The decision to reduce our timetable was to ensure our customers have confidence in the services that we can provide and we share customers' deep disappointment that our full timetable did not perform as we would hope or expect.

“A dedicated team is working hard to fix the underlying issues but it’s important to acknowledge that there remain challenges such as the impact of staff absences due to Covid and the ability to introduce additional trains.

“We will continue to advise key stakeholders and customers as progress is made.”

Beanie Babies were a huge hit in the 1990s but they quickly faded into relative obscurity. The once-popular children’s toys now draw a different crowd — collectors.

The same tiny stuffed animals that once sold for only a few bucks now sell for thousands of dollars on the secondary market. As a rule the more unique the Beanie Baby the more valuable it is which means that certain versions with slight variations in styling or even errors in production often command the highest prices.

Top 10 Most Expensive Beanie Babies

Compiling a list like this can be a bit difficult because there’s no real consensus regarding the valuation of Beanie Babies. Browse around online and you’ll likely notice that the most expensive Beanie Babies have a wide variety of prices depending on where you look.

In this article we list the top 10 Beanie Babies that fetched the highest prices on eBay in 2021.

1. Curly the Bear – $9500

Curly is a brown bear with a dark red ribbon adorning his neck. He’s not a particularly uncommon bear — he’s known to have been given away at pro sporting events by the thousands in the late ’90s.

Still he’s the third top-selling bear in all retired Beanie Babies on eBay with one buyer considering Curly worth a cool $9500.

2. Mystic the Unicorn – $9861

Mystic the Unicorn was born on May 21 1994 with “magic in her blue eyes.”

This one features an iridescent horn a coarse yarn mane and — according to the seller — several tag errors.

3. Pinchers the Lobster – $10000

Originally released as “Punchers” — perhaps in error — Pinchers is one of the original nine Beanie Babies. The version with the “Punchers” tag is naturally highly coveted by collectors but sadly this is not one of them.

Instead “Pinchers” supposedly features a different tag error that’s difficult to identify. Whatever it is it wasn’t lost on the buyer who placed the lone bid of $10000.

4. Valentina the Bear – $11111

As you might guess Valentina was born on Valentine’s Day 1998. The seller claimed that there were errors on the tag but it’s hard to tell given that the image shown was the only one included in the listing.

Undeterred an eager buyer snatched this Valentina up for just over $11000.

5. Halo the Bear – $12000

Halo a bear in the likeness of an angel was born on August 31 1998 and was released 30 days later. Her poem depicts her as a guardian angel watching over you from above.

It may be that Halo was one of the most expensive bears to produce because of her iridescent fabric which explains in part why some examples have sold for thousands of dollars.

Story continues

6. The End the Bear – $14000

When Ty announced that they were shutting down the Beanie Babies line they released The End the Bear — a black bear with the words “The End” stitched onto his chest along with embroidered fireworks. He was retired in December 1999 and was supposed to be the last one produced.

Luckily for fans of Beanie Babies worldwide protest prompted the toy company to resume production the following year. Ty produced a New Year’s bear named The Beginning in 2000 — The End is frequently sold with it as a set. This one was not but that didn’t stop the buyer from offering $14000 for this one.

7. Hippity the Rabbit – $19999.99

Hippity is an adorable mint green rabbit with pink whiskers and an emerald-colored ribbon tied around his neck. Most of these go for double-digits but this one with a missing period after the ‘C’ in P.V.C. sold for a penny shy of $20000 in April of 2021.

Perhaps it’s the high value and the rarity of this Beanie with such an error or perhaps the buyer was motivated by charity — 10% of the proceeds went to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

8. Derby the Horse – $20000

There were four versions of Derby the Horse — the original which used fine yarn for the mane and tail a version with a fluffy mane and two with a coarse yarn for the mane and tail differentiated by the absence or presence of a white patch or star on his forehead.

Despite being the most common of the lot — the coarse mane with a star — this one is supposed to have errors making it much more unique than it would normally be. There wasn’t much description provided by the seller but the buyer evidently saw something in this listing that made them willing to part with $20000.

9. Princess the Bear + Digital Art – $25000

Princess the Bear is one of the most beloved Beanie Babies around and that’s because of the story behind it. The purple plushie saw a limited release in October 1997 to commemorate the death of the late princess. Proceeds from the sale were to go to the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.

In reality Princess the Bear was so popular that Ty decided to release thousands more of the bear. While some versions of this bear sometimes sell for a few thousand this one was special because per the listing it came bundled with digital art in the form of an NFT — a relatively new phenomenon that’s likely to change the world of collectibles forever.

10. Steg the Stegosaurus – $40000

Steg the adorable dinosaur tops the list at $50000. Born on November 1 1994 he was released on June 3 1995 along with two other dinosaurs Bronty and Rex.

This one is frequently counterfeited but collectors know that Steg only came in shades of brown with green and yellow hues. It also always has the copyright year 1995 on the tush tag.

People often find a trunk of old Beanie Babies and get excited when they see the prices that people have listed examples for online. Sadly that doesn’t really tell you much about their true value. A collector’s item is only worth what someone will pay not what the seller asks. If you have some Beanie Babies to sell find out what rare examples look like then look for consistent sales in the same price range not at the outliers.

May and Rod Proctor bought cheap items from eBay Home Bargains and charity shops to help create the perfect look.

The couple also saved money by using scrap wood and donations from family members.

Speaking to money saving community LatestDeals.co.uk May and Rod said: “We have 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. Pete our five-year-old grandson comes here a lot as his mum and dad are always at work. We love having him every weekend and I came up with the idea to make a play shed for him.

“We looked on Pinterest but it was far too expensive. I knew we had wood and cable reels already and we found some plastic glass in a skip. Plus our daughter gave us spindles and railings so we had lots to get started with.

""Our other supplies largely came from eBay or the local charity shop. We picked up two large tins of paint from the charity shop for £12 and the fabric we used for the curtains and cushion cover came from eBay for £10. In the charity shop we also picked up a lamp to go in the shed for £2.99 and the artificial grass was £25 from eBay.

“The other materials such as the wood for the decking and the shed itself either came from skips or were given to us by various people. In fact the decking is actually made out of scaffolding boards!”

The couple thought hard about where to put the shed as they wanted to make sure they could see the grandchildren playing from the window.

May told LatestDeals.co.uk: “I sat down and designed it and my husband made it. The first step for Rod was to make the decking and steps. While Rod built the frame I got started on making the supplies for the interior decorations. I made curtains and large cushion covers using the bargain fabric and put the little TV from our kitchen in there.

“Rod built some shelves for our grandson to do his colouring and store his belongings. The next step was to paint everything. This was a long job as there was plenty to do! The gravel path was already there and then two steps lead up to the shed. Rod laid some artificial grass on there and also made some toadstools out of cement sand and logs for the bases.

“I bought all of the plants and pansies to line the gravel path from Home Bargains and put them in old teapots we found in the charity shop. The flowers plants and teapots did not cost more than £30 overall. The project in total took us about two weeks to complete.

""Now we are done our grandson loves colouring in his own hobbit shed and watching TV he has brought in some of his own supplies and we love watching him from the kitchen window.”

The sound it makes (squelch) is viscerally satisfying like paint glopped out of a tube in a preschool-learning cartoon.

They collapse one by one staggering to a flat-backed fall or folding in on themselves like posters that have spent too much time rolled up. And then they’re gone headless husks become small clouds of red each leaving behind a crimson diamond that glows blue in the center. I collect them all and press onward.

Prior to this month I hadn’t played or given much thought to American McGee’s Alice for at least a decade probably even a little more. But now hours-deep in the demented fairytale-gone-revenge-slasher once again well it feels like coming home.

During a not-insignificant portion of my formative tween years Alice was my life.

Electronic Arts

Game designer American McGee’s twisted vision of Lewis Carroll’s (already sort of creepy) Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass was published by EA in 2000 to mixed critical reception.

Reviewers raved about the storyline a haunting narrative that picks up with the titular character catatonic in a psychiatric institution years after surviving a fire that killed her whole family. The art was striking for the time and character design stood in a league of its own rounded out by witty dialogue and poignant voice acting; your guide the Cheshire Cat as one reviewer noted “delivers his lines in the manner of Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs.” But some found the linear gameplay lackluster with repetitive combat and puzzle elements that were too easy to solve. Above all else though it was effective — evocative to a degree that got right under your skin and stayed with you after you stopped playing. Alice’s whimsical escapades had been spun in strange ways before but never quite like this.

On the title page a single unsettling image says it all: teenage Alice sitting wide-eyed on a hospital bed clutching a stuffed rabbit her wrists wrapped in bloodied bandages. It is a journey into a tormented mind nightmares and lived traumas turned into real and crucially killable creatures.

Perhaps that’s what hooked me so hard.

A journey into a tormented mind

Alice found me during a dark confusing time several years after its release: middle school. I say that not with the usual shudder that tends to accompany our memories of life’s more awkward stages — I was lucky in that regard with a great group of friends and a sense of style I’m not entirely mortified to look back on. But my family had been dealt some pretty difficult cards and they all chose that moment to peak. My biggest concerns in the early 2000s should have been that my friends already had boyfriends and my mom wouldn’t let me wear thongs but were instead that my dad was dying from ALS and close-call asthma attacks kept landing me blue-lipped in the emergency room and my health was in a constant state of decline but no one could figure out why.

Increasingly I found I couldn’t connect with the interests of my peers. Everything just felt so… childish. Everything except the macabre.

Engrossed in horror fiction I came alive. I read a lot of Stephen King watched a lot of scary movies I plastered my bedroom walls with posters of Victoria Francés’s melancholic vampires. Horror was my blood-soaked security blanket and somewhere along the way Alice became my outlet.

It was my mom who put the obsession in motion really.

Speaking to her about it now some 15 years later she says she thinks the cover just grabbed her attention one day while wandering around the Tower Records (RIP) we used to frequent. “I was like she’d love this they’d [my brother and I] love this” she says and so she bought it.

As this was still the age of the “family computer” though it was by then on its way out playing Alice became something we all did together. My brother — slightly older than me and thus the expert of video games to my juvenile mind — played on Nightmare Mode and I jumped around behind him clinging to the back of the chair and shouting in his ear. I played on an easier setting following his guidance but stubborn enough to refuse help on the bosses I couldn’t beat.

“We all liked this same thing we liked the graphics the story — that game we all had that in common” she says. “When I see that game it’s fond memories.”

“Maybe it wasn’t a game for kids” she shrugs “but it was a tough time the family was broken. Things like this pulled us out of that. It kind of pulled us together pulled us out of our grief and stress and unhappiness.”

“You could just dive into it” she added.

“It pulled us together pulled us out of our grief and stress and unhappiness.”

We ingested all the lore we could find and read the accompanying booklet a fictional casebook penned by Alice’s doctor in the psych ward cover to cover a million times over. I drew pictures of McGee’s emaciated Cheshire Cat and doodled my name in the style of the title’s thorned typeface. And I carved my way through grotesque card guards and hurled knives at shrieking demons relishing the flames that shot out of their eyeholes when a fatal blow plucked them out of the sky.

I could hack and slash my way through distorted reimaginings of familiar characters from my childhood for hours on end their existences warped too as a result of circumstances beyond their control.

“I barely recognize this terrible place” Alice says to the hookah-smoking caterpillar at one point in the game. “What is it to me?” She later asks “Why must I suffer?”

“Because your mind is fouled by self-deception” he tells her. “Even your fantasies have fragmented into tortured versions of themselves. You are wracked with guilt because you survived. And you dread the prospect of a life alone.”

Destroy the Queen of Hearts he says and make everything right.

Alice’s quest for sanity the ultimate goal of the game was my quest for order. And rather than alienating me from my family closing me off in an isolated bubble of consumption it gave us something fun to do together in a time that was otherwise very bleak. It was our thing.

Looking back it makes sense. Horror can be comforting in its own odd way. In an interview at the beginning of 2021 nonfiction author and PTSD survivor Peter Counter explained that “horror media thrives on the border between the human experience and the unknowable.”

Moreover: “Horror grows from the discomfort of the human mind confronting the idea that the order we impose on our world is simply a coping mechanism to deal with the true chaotic state of the universe. It’s humbling. When order fails to be reinstated at the end of a narrative rather than a sense of closure horror encourages the audience to find acceptance. It removes our human agency. It decentralizes us.”

Horror can be comforting in its own odd way.

Stephen Graham Jones’s novel My Heart Is a Chainsaw explores this idea masterfully. His protagonist Jade makes horror — slashers specifically — her entire personality in the wake of trauma. It softens the blow of those painful lived experiences and ensures she’s always ready for whatever’s lurking around the corner. Being the weird horror chick has its benefits.

As a teen surrounded by death and uncertainty it was my lifeline.

And of course there is the part of it that isn’t that deep: It was a fun game that I could actually beat something rare for a serial game-abandoner such as myself. Its darkness was alluring in the way that spooky things tend to be — it looked cool. American McGee understood that appeal and was himself drawn in by it which is probably why it worked so well.

“A lot of my inspiration comes from dark things” he said in a 2001 interview with the website Game Developer. “I like dark music dark movies and dark fiction so I guess the question is why am I so infatuated with things of a dark nature? I don't know… I think that going in the dark direction was just a rebellious sort of thing on my part but over the years it has become a big part of who I am. I just have a taste for that darker side of things.”

Revisiting Alice now at 28 years old and with the knowledge of having survived those darkest times slicing through the horrors again feels so good. Now I play on Nightmare Mode.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ3Y3B1bHNlLmNvbS9leHByZXNzLW5ld3NsZXR0ZXItY29udGVudC8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL2dhbWUtb3Zlci1uaW50ZW5kby1sZWF2aW5nLXJlZHdvb2QtY2l0eS1kaXNwbGFjaW5nLWVtcGxveWVlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Game Over: Nintendo leaving Redwood City displacing employees,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

(October 30th),"Team of the Week

Our Pick: Dayot Upamecano (84 — CB — Bayern)

SBCs

Objectives and Misc.

Welcome to the Locker Room. Here we can talk about all of FIFA 22 's Ultimate Team mode news once a week. That includes a list of the Team of the Week cards including our chosen pick as well as the newest SBCs and the objectives for the week.Headlining this week is the Egyptian King Mohammad Salah as a 91-rated RF an 86-rated Dušan Tadić out in LW and 86-rated David Alaba. Now the star of the week — so the inform player gets a double boost — is Simone the 86-rated ST from Fiorentina with some famous heritage. He lines up on the bench next to a very strong Ligue 1 Atal card the RB from Algeria and playing for Nice. Arsenal's Emil Smith-Rowe also makes it into the informs with a solid — if unspectacular — LF card that will be a cheap as you like. It is also is very reminiscent of Mason Mount's inform this week out in RF.Sorry Salah you are just too expensive for us. Upamecano is just a solid card: pace strength and tackling numbers to make your shins hurt. There isn't much to say really he will be starting in Bundesliga teams up and down the ladder for a while to come. So if you can afford him it is worth the punt. On a side note the Bundesliga is shaping up to be a great cheap league to invest in with all the special cards rolling out for it. The last few weeks there have been three good 'uns every time! So it might be a perfect side project or if you just want a good place to start then the Buli is calling.There are plenty of cheap-ish SBCs on offer this week. We have picked the currently available SBCs and priced them as per FUTbin 's amazing listings. The 87-rated N'Golo Kanté Flashback card is a bit naughty though the FIFA community seems a bit split on his shoddy pace. That being said the total set price is set at 300k. If you have that much lying around I envy you. But let's be real you can put that money into a prime Pirlo and be well happy. As of writing you have three days to unlock the Europa League Road To The Knockouts Filip Kostić card for 30k. While his skills are 3-star and his weak foot is well... weak this is the kind of SBC we all love. He is 86-rated in an LM position a position of weakness for the Bundesliga at the moment. With good all-around numbers I would suggest picking it up and using him as a bench player on an LM in a 3-4-3. As of this article's release there should be another card up for grabs for SBCs so have a little look!While writing there is only one available player from objective challenges because the Rulebreaker cards are yet to be released (see above tweet!). So Miguel Layún is a 74-rated Silver Star for the week. He heralds from Liga BBVA MX (the Mexican League) playing for América (the cub not America). To nab him you just need to head to the Silver Lounge Friendlies and get three wins eight goals and six assists. The image you are seeing above is of last weeks Champions League Road to the Knockout cards that are now out of packs and on the market. They upgrade with either three games won or the knockout round passed so there are some tidy investments in there. He is expensive but Timo Werner is probably a really good pick-up as Chelsea are one of the favourites in the competition this year. Shout out to the fact we aren't getting Ultimate Scream cards this year... I'm saying goodbye to my customary Hakan Çalhanoğlu investment.

But what will you be grabbing this week? Any player taking your fancy? Agree with our Player Pick from the TOTW?

As one of the world’s leading high jumpers she has become a 12-time US champion who also counts a world indoor gold among her many accolades but her impact goes far beyond the field of play. The four-time Olympian’s achievements in the athletics arena may have provided a platform but her experiences determination and fight now mean she is a champion for so much more.

In June 2019 the then 35-year-old was diagnosed with breast cancer but her battle had begun almost a year before that when she found a small lump but was told she was too young to have a mammogram. At that time it was diagnosed as a lymph node and so she returned home relieved and ready to undergo the required treatment to make it go away. Only it didn’t.

Throughout October she has been supporting Breast Cancer Awareness Month but the 2008 Olympic bronze medallist – who is also a motivational speaker – is constantly championing change. Now cancer free she knows that early detection is key.

“It was a tiny rice-sized lump that I knew hadn’t been there even two weeks or the month before” Lowe explains. “The doctor just looked at me and was like ‘no you need to gain some weight’ and he said not to come back for six years” she adds with mammograms usually only recommended for women over the age of 40.

“So I believed him and thought ‘oh good but that was a scare. Let me eat right let me do everything that I always promise myself that I’m going to do’. As an athlete we know our bodies and when you say lymph node then I’m going to go and do all the research and figure out how to make this lymph node get smaller. But I’m doing all the things and it’s getting bigger.”

Eleven months later she went back to the doctor and had to really push for further investigation. They eventually did the test and found the lump had tripled in size. She was immediately sent for a biopsy.

“I go for the biopsy and it was so hard because we had just lost Gabe” she adds with the US distance runner and inspirational rare cancer advocate Gabriele Grunewald having died just days before.

“It turned out that it was breast cancer and it was a very aggressive form of fast-growing breast cancer.”





One in eight

The World Health Organisation states that as of the end of 2020 there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous five years making it the world’s most prevalent cancer. Among the statistics Lowe shares is that one in eight women in America will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.

“One in eight – that’s absurd” she says. “When I learned that statistic I also learned that African American women are 40 per cent more likely to die of breast cancer than our white counterparts.”

Now as well as being a global ambassador for the American Cancer Society Lowe has partnered with breast cancer organisation Susan G. Komen and pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly who are taking action to improve breast cancer health equity.

“One of the things that is really important for me is to have somebody that can help navigate things through because as soon as you are diagnosed with breast cancer or as soon as I was they pushed me through this tunnel and everything happened at lightning speed” she says. “My mind was spinning so much that I couldn’t even comprehend the information that they were giving me. So to have somebody who is competent who understands the barriers that are unique to African Americans; that is there put in place. I am not only an advocate for African American women but that is where the need is right now so I am happy about that partnership but I still continue to advocate for all women worldwide not even just here in the US.”

So for Lowe quitting had never been an option. Despite undergoing a double mastectomy and chemotherapy she continued to train through her treatment as she targeted a return to competition knowing the profile that would bring in raising awareness.

Lowe’s aim had been to compete at a fifth Olympic Games in Tokyo and she made her competitive comeback in March clearing 1.80m at two meetings in Florida. The 37-year-old felt like she was building back well on track ahead of the US Olympic Trials but then she her husband and their three children all contracted Covid-19.

“Having the opportunity to compete in the Olympics four separate times I had seen the huge section dedicated to media” she says. “The world is watching.

“I felt like it was important to number one have a goal to push through (during her cancer treatment). When the days got hard if I ever thought of giving up to have that goal was monumental. But then I knew that if I got there that there would be an opportunity to share this message. I told myself that even if one woman or man heard it and checked themselves and they found a lump and it saved their life and maybe their kids got to keep their parent that was enough for me.

“I have had a tremendous amount of people reach out to me and say ‘because of you I got my mammogram’ or ‘I was just diagnosed can you please share your experience with me?’ And I talk with them. It’s probably the most rewarding job I’ve ever had.”

Resilience

After all she had been through missing the Olympics due to Covid was understandably hard but putting it into perspective Lowe was focused on surviving.

“I honestly thought I was going to die. This is not something that is comparable to the flu” she says. “This is something that is actually ripping people away from their families and my white blood cell count was still extremely compromised from the chemotherapy. It’s a miracle in my opinion that I was able to fight off Covid and survive it.”

She now uses her platform to talk about her resilience through both.

“I really got pushed into this motivational and inspirational speaking realm and my goal is to continue to raise awareness about breast cancer but also inspire with my journey through athletics” says Lowe who set the US high jump record of 2.05m in 2010. “You would think because of the pandemic that it would get quieter but it has been the exact opposite! So I have been doing a lot of virtual events I do them every single day now and it’s great for me because I really feel like the work that I am doing makes a difference.

“It’s not what I would have chosen for myself obviously you don’t want to be the spokesperson for breast cancer. However being put in this situation and experiencing it first-hand allowed me to put myself in the place of other women or men who may experience it because they have it themselves or a loved one has it and I feel like lending my voice kind of helps empower them and so I am willing to do that at any cost.

“I partnered with organisations like the American Cancer Society Komen and Lilly because they are giving me the opportunity to talk to legislators and those that make the laws and the recommendations and share my story” she adds. “Because what I personally want is 18-year-olds getting breast ultrasounds. With mammograms the breast tissue is usually a little bit too dense and so you can’t see things until you are about 40. But those ultrasounds can and so I want to see that changed because I was sitting in chemotherapy at Stage 1 yet there was a girl who was 23 at Stage 3 being treated right next to me. The more research I did the more I was understanding that women are being diagnosed younger and younger and we don’t know why but at the same time right now early detection is our best defence against it. So we have to use what we have and I feel like it’s my job knowing this to fight for that.

“I have been in a very blessed position to have this platform because of the gifts that I have been given as an athlete. I feel that it would almost be a waste of the gifts if I don’t use that platform for good and I feel an obligation to that because the sport of athletics has given me so much. It has allowed me an education to be able to provide a home for my family and to even have the resources – I had my medical insurance because of athletics and to be able to treat and fight the disease I feel like it is my responsibility.”

It is also because of a connection within the sport that she even started doing self breast checks at all. Jamaican sprinter Novlene Williams-Mills had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and Lowe reached out after reading her story.

“Novlene was a great friend of mine even before her own diagnosis” Lowe explains. “I read about her diagnosis and I had the opportunity to be on a bus with her. I was like ‘hey what happened and how did you know?’ Because I didn’t know how to do a self breast exam. I didn’t even know that I was supposed to be doing them regularly at that point. She talked to me about it and told me about her process and so I started doing them because of her.”





Next steps

While Covid denied Lowe the chance to go for her fifth Olympic team she feels she achieved her aim of using it as a stage to share breast cancer awareness through her link with Eli Lilly.

“Eli Lilly supported me going towards that fifth Olympics but for them it was more about giving me their platform to share my story” she says. “When I watched the Olympic Games during the opening ceremonies my video popped up. My kids were like ‘Mommy you made it!’ It was so beautiful because that was the goal. Realistically I wasn’t going to make medals at this Games I just wanted to get there and for them to lend their platform they made that come true – I was there. That commercial ran over and over and I was there and people who were able to see my face could remember the story and maybe remember to get checked.”

She also intends to be there when the World Athletics Championships take place on home soil in Oregon next year.

“It is a huge target” she smiles. “For the world that hasn’t been able to experience the crowd of Eugene Oregon you are going to love it. It is tremendous.

“My goal is to get on that track. I’ve only seen it on TV and I want to get on that track! I started training for real this week and I was surprised; I retained a lot of what I did last year so I am not starting from zero. It was the first time since Covid hit that my heart wasn’t hurting and my lungs weren’t hurting. So I was like yes! We’re good!”

And one thing is for sure: whatever happens on the track Lowe will continue to aim high for breast cancer awareness.

During the walk between stops 1 and 2 of a Yorkshire History Walk two individuals shared stories of early Yorkshire resident Stanley Haines. The first one pointing out the house that Mahlon Haines built as a wedding gift when his son married and the second was the tale of Stanley being a Second World War Prisoner of War.

During the Yorkshire History Walk on September 18th I had requests for copies of my talks. This series of posts includes the script at each stop with Bonus History; i.e. the full text that I started with at each stop prior to the edit to keep to an overall 90-minute schedule. The story of Stanley Haines is additional Bonus History; which was new to me. I’ll share those details and add a little of my own research.

Stop 2—The Yorkshire Trolley stop on York County’s electric streetcar system.

Stop 2 was located along Eastern Boulevard where it intersects Wynwood Road. Per the Yorkshire History Walk map this stop location was selected due to its close proximity to the site of the Yorkshire Trolley stop. We know where that trolley stop was located because it is indicated on the earliest plan of Yorkshire.

In 1924 when Yorkshire was initially developed York County’s electric trolley streetcar system consisted of 85 miles of track with nearly 11-million passenger trips per year. The Yorkshire Trolley stop along the York to Wrightsville line was located on the south side of Market Street mid-way between Lyndhurst and Pinehurst Roads.

Trolley service in and near the City of York existed from August 18 1892 until February 4 1939. However trolley service extended to Wrightsville for a shorter time span from May 21 1904 until February 1 1933. That trolley track generally ran adjacent to the south side of the Lincoln Highway between East York and Wrightsville. There are early 1930s photos of trolley cars at Stony Brook. In asking if anybody had photos of a trolley car at the Yorkshire stop one person thought they might; however that search did not pan out.

As we walked between Stop 1 and Stop 2 in passing the house at 3026 Eastern Boulevard a gentleman asked if I knew that is the house Mahlon Haines built as a wedding gift for his son in the late 1930s. I asked if that was his son Stanley? He thought it was. The introductory photo of this post shows that house on the southwest corner of Eastern Boulevard and Pinehurst Road. Shown is the 3026 Eastern Boulevard side of the house.

Newspaper accounts confirm that is indeed a house built just prior to the April 28 1937 marriage of Mahlon’s son Stanley E. Haines to Mary Elizabeth Nevin. They were planning to move into it immediately after their honeymoon trip to Florida and Cuba.

The following September 15 1937 aerial photo of northwest section of the Yorkshire Development is used to highlighted locations of the Yorkshire Trolley Stop which existed from 1924 until 1933 and the 1937 house constructed by Mahlon Haines as a wedding gift for Mr. and Mrs. Stanley E. Haines.

After the gentleman shared the location of Stanley Haines’ house a woman mentioned her mother often told about the day Mary Haines got the telegram during the war; informing her husband was Missing In Action. She indicated that Stanley and Mary Haines were well liked and the whole Yorkshire community was shocked and saddened by the news. Later Mary was notified Stanley was captured. Stanley Haines was a Prisoner of War and Purple Heart recipient. Upon returning home Stanley was never the same; and probably had what we know today as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Stanley Emerson Haines was born in York during 1910 when Mr. & Mrs. Mahlon Haines lived at 334 West Market Street. He was their first child. Early schooling was in York before attending Staunton Military Academy and the Tome School in Port Deposit Maryland.

In June of 1936 the announcement of the engagement was made between Miss Mary Nevin and Stanley Haines. At that time Stanley was listed as the road manager of Haines Shoe Company’s chain of 45 shoe stores. They were married April 28 1937 in the First Methodist Episcopal Church in York.

The York Dispatch of November 28 1944 contained the following photo under the heading; “Missing In Action.” Quoting the photo caption: “Private First Class Stanley Emerson Haines who has been serving with the U. S. Infantry in Germany has been missing in action since November 8; according to a telegram received by his wife from the war department. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Mahlon N. Haines Haines Acres and the husband of Mary Nevin Haines.”

His military records available on Ancestry.com show that PFC Stanley E. Haines served in Co. L 112th Inf. 28th Div. during World War II. While serving in Europe from July 24 1944 until June 18 1945; he was a Prisoner of War in Stalag 3B Furstenberg from November 8 1944 until May 31 1945.

Mahlon Haines II the other son of Mahlon Haines also served during WWII. He was in the Army from March 15 1944 until March 2 1946; and served overseas from May 1 1945 until July 11 1945. Corporal Haines served in Co. B 161st Airborne Eng. Batn.

Stanley and Mary Haines had no children. After Stanley passed away in 1966 Mary Haines continued to live at 3026 Eastern Boulevard until her death in 1994.

Best Ways to Save on Natural Gas

10/31/2021

Looking to save energy and reduce your natural gas bills but don't know where to start? The U.S. Department of Energy has identified weatherstripping and caulking followed by insulation improvements as the most effective ways to save energy in a home.

By some estimates closing air leaks through gaps and cracks can save 30 to 40 percent on home heating costs. Poor insulation makes walls cold and forces your system to work harder and use more energy. For the biggest savings add insulation in the attic. In fact if a home is properly sealed and insulated other measures such as installing a high efficiency furnace may not be the best investment.

Some additional key measures to conserve natural gas include:

Maintain the heating system. Have your furnace inspected regularly by a qualified professional and change filters once per month.

Install a programmable thermostat. These help to save energy by automatically turning down the heat in your home while you're away. They can save up to $100 per year in heating costs.

Turn down the water heater. Set your water heater no higher than 120°F. This is warm enough to meet your household needs and every 10°F reduction can save up to five percent in water heating costs.

Conserve hot water. Low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators can reduce hot water consumption. Take shorter showers and wash only full loads in dishwashers and clothes washers.

Cook up energy savings. Simple things in the kitchen can save on natural gas bills. Use a smaller pan if possible and put a lid on it so the food cooks faster. Use the microwave to heat food whenever possible.

When replacing natural gas appliances and equipment purchase models that are ENERGY STAR® certified for high energy performance.

The City of Newberg City Council will discuss implementation of their planned 5-year 52-point plan for triplexes quadplexes townhouses and cottage clusters in all residential zones where currently only single-family dwellings are allowed. The plan provides tax exemptions for “vertical” and low-income housing subsidized work and living spaces tiny housing car camping waived building and planning fees density bonuses and much much more.

The full agenda for the November 1st meeting at 7 pm can be read in this packet but here are some highlights

From the City’s middle housing briefing report for the meeting

Briefing Middle Housing – Triplex Quadplex Cottage Clusters and Townhouses (HB 2001)

The Oregon Legislature passed HB 2001 in 2019 and appropriated funds to the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) for the purpose of providing grants to local governments for the implementation of missing middle housing. The City Council adopted Resolution No. 202-3669 to support a grant application to address Middle Housing. DLCD ultimately awarded the City a grant of $60000 to develop regulations to comply with the HB 2001 and OAR 660-046.

Through a Request for Proposal process 3 J Consulting was selected along with their sub-consultant Jet Planning.



The City approached the process in two phases. Phase 1 is to develop regulations for duplexes. This phase was completed on June 7 2021. Phase 2 is for triplexes quadplexes cottage clusters and townhouses. A proposal on these Middle Housing types will be brought to the Planning Commission and City Council in late fall of 2021.



The City Council appointed a Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) to provide feedback and guidance to staff and the consultant team. The CAC met five times. The

Committee members include:

Melisa Dailey – Chair

Robert Bonner – Vice Chair

Gabriel Skulec

Leslie Murray

Irma Vera

Robert Moxley

Two Community Forums were held. The first on December 15 2020 and the second on February 22 2021. In coordination with the first Community Form a survey was conducted with 192 participants. A second survey was conducted after Community Form #2 and closed on March 12.

The second task for the middle housing code updates is to permit triplexes quadplexes cottage clusters and townhouses on all lots where single-family detached dwellings are permitted including within all master plan areas under the same terms. Code updates have been drafted to comply with House Bill 2001 and the provisions of Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) 660-046 Middle Housing in Medium and Large Cities. These code amendments which span multiple sections will be packaged and brought before the Planning Commission on November 10 2021 and the City Council on December 6 2021.

STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT: (Relate to Council Goals if applicable)

2020 Council Goals:

Change operational culture to one focused on Customer Service and act to Resolve Ongoing Legal Disputes. Further develop an operational culture that adopts and cherishes Diversity Equity and Inclusion as core values. Providing triplex quadplex cottage cluster and townhome housing opportunities for Newberg residents can further the Council goal for Diversity Equity and Inclusion. Promote development of housing affordability such as houselessness transitional housing workforce housing. Complying with HB 2001 for triplex quadplex cottage cluster and townhouses can provide additional housing opportunities to address the affordability issues Newberg is facing as documented in the Housing Create and support an Urban Renewal Plan and Authority. Collaborate with local partners and with entities like ICLEI in the development of a Sustainability program.





The City of Newberg City Council will also be discussing their plans for “houselessness” as detailed in the following brief

Briefing Middle Housing – Triplex Quadplex Cottage Clusters and Townhouses (HB 2001)

As part of the City Council Goal of “Promote development of housing affordability such as houselessness transitional housing workforce housing” the City Council held discussions in 2020 on development of a Housing Work Program with input from the Affordable Housing Commission. On November 2 2020 the City Council accepted the Housing Work Program that outlined work activities for the Community Development Department. This presentation is an update to the work program on activities that have occurred over the past year and adjustments based new opportunities or activities. Attachment 1 is the updated overall Housing Work Program.

Activities that were completed over the past year include:

Establish a Construction Excise Tax – Completed November 2020

Adjust timing on payment of SDCs – Completed November 2020

Establish vertical housing tax abatement district – Completed May 2021

Infrastructure Time Based Extension – Completed December 2020

Update Housing Needs Analysis BLI – Completed July 2021

Missing Middle Housing (duplexes in single family zones) – Completed June 2021

Conduct full analysis of land sufficiency within Newberg UGB (EOA/Public-Semi Public Lands

Need/UGB Amendment) – Completed February 2021 & April 2021



Adjustments include advancing the Housing Production Strategy program The City applied for and was awarded a grant from the Department of Land Conservation and Development in the amount of $70000. This body of work was originally planned for FY 2022/2023. With the grant award the activity has been advanced to FY 2021. The second adjustment relates to the activity of “Decrease time from substantial completion of utilities to final plat approval.” This was advanced forward based on HB 2036 and will take place in FY 2021/2022.

The ICLEI mentioned in the documents is Local Governments for Sustainability (or simply ICLEI) an international non-governmental organization that promotes “sustainable development”.

The full council brief presentation PDF can be downloaded here. The plan includes “conversion of existing buildings” into so-called “cottage clusters” which is a politically correct term for tiny home villages. As detailed in the plan the goal of the council’s implementation of HOUSE BILL 2001 is to allow tiny homes in all current residential areas where single family homes are presently allowed. Part of this plan will be a significant reduction of minimum lot sizes.

As part of the strategy ordinances are planned to be updated to allow for “car camping” in residential areas

“Car camping” is a politically correct term for homeless people and other vagrants or vagabonds such as van lifers who live in their vehicles. It is also referred to as “stealth camping”.

These plans have been in the works and publicly discussed over the past 18 months and are nearing implementation. The city’s stated goal is: “Further develop an operational culture that adopts and cherishes Diversity Equity and Inclusion as core values.”

This marks the first time a beauty brand has partnered on a research and development opportunity for innovators to propose concepts leveraging the ISS National Lab to advance sustainability research for plastics alternatives. As part of the brand’s commitment to support research that can help drive sustainable packaging innovation Estée Lauder will provide funding for the awarded proposals.

The ISS National Lab Sustainability Challenge: Beyond Plastics will unite innovators on an important mission to address plastic waste and enable scientific or technological advancements that help improve Earth’s environment. Such research has the potential to unmask new insights into cost-effective and innovative avenues for environmentally responsible biopolymers or plastics alternatives.

The objective of the Sustainability Challenge is to use the unique ISS environment to develop test or mature products and processes that address at least one of the following goals:

Reduce plastic waste introduction into the environment

Seek alternative feedstocks and pathways for polymer production beyond petrochemicals

Reduce virgin plastic manufacturing

“We are proud to be the exclusive partner of the ISS National Lab Sustainability Challenge funding research for future-thinking plastics alternatives” said Stéphane de La Faverie Global Brand President Estée Lauder & AERIN and Group President The Estée Lauder Companies. “As a global leader in the beauty industry we are committed to furthering scientific research and innovation for more sustainable business practices. We are excited to be part of an initiative that could be truly transformative for our brand our beloved consumers and the future of our planet.”

As the exclusive partner of the ISS National Lab Sustainability Challenge and founding member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition Estée Lauder reinforces its commitment to long-term science research for more sustainable practices. In addition to ingredient transparency responsible sourcing and energy and emissions efforts sustainable packaging is a key part of Estée Lauder’s sustainability strategy. The brand has implemented robust measures to drive the reduction of virgin and non-recyclable plastic and has committed by 2025 that 75-100% of Estée Lauder packaging will be recyclable refillable reusable recycled or recoverable.

“We are excited to collaborate with Estée Lauder as we seek novel advancements through space-based research and development to mitigate plastic pollution on our planet” said Christine Kretz vice president of programs and partnerships for the ISS National Lab. “We thank Estée Lauder for its enthusiastic support of the ISS National Lab Sustainability Challenge: Beyond Plastics and we look forward to working alongside researchers as they propose science that will improve the environment of our beautiful planet.”

The ISS National Lab Sustainability Challenge is an open solicitation for U.S.-based entities to propose projects that leverage the orbiting research platform for applied research and technology development. Applicants must first submit a concept form to ideally address a whole-of-life design approach to production of virgin polymers through sustainable feedstocks or the biodegrading or upcycling of end-of-life of polymers. A subset of applicants with the most promising concepts will then be invited to submit a pre-recorded “pitch” video describing their concept in more detail.

The projects will be evaluated by a panel of expert judges and on March 19 2022 a Sustainability Challenge event will be held at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex where the finalists’ recorded presentations will be showcased and live streamed to a global audience.

While the uniqueness and rarity of these digital products work for sectors already steeped in exclusivity the applicability and opportunity in the beauty sector has been somewhat hard to pin down.

Is it an extension of branding? Product marketing? A bid for customer loyalty?

Perhaps all of the above — and more — judging by Clinique’s latest digital project a trio of NFTs unveiled earlier this month. The digital assets symbolize the brand’s marquee products Moisture Surge 100H and Almost Lipstick Black Honey and the company’s own identity and heritage.

For the Estée Lauder company its “MetaOptimist” NFTs are more than just a stab at hopping on a hot blockchain trend. It’s a stepping-stone toward yet another buzzworthy tech.

“We’ve been looking at what are the next rising platforms to create true experiences and what’s the role of these platforms” Carolyn Dawkins senior vice president of Clinique Global online consumer engagement and product marketing told WWD.

“So just as much as we’re all obsessed with hearing what’s about to land on October 28 with Facebook and the metaverse and where the metaverse is going — the interim is NFTs. What we wanted to make sure we were really clear on was the role of this rising digital platform” she said.

The metaverse is a vague term that has generally come to mean shared virtual environments that can be accessed in various ways — through connected eyeglasses phones computers and more — with immersive features that offer a greater sense of presence than a mere video chat or social feed.

Silicon Valley has been mulling it over for years but in recent months Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has been waxing especially enthusiastic even making it a crucial part of his company’s latest earnings report. The social media giant aims to transform itself into a metaverse company and that has implications for a new breed of social media e-commerce and consumer experience.

Dawkins’ view of NFTs as a gateway to the metaverse speaks to a broader notion that such digital assets will fuel commerce in the virtual world — an idea Zuckerberg touched on in Monday’s earnings call. According to the tech CEO the company is building an ecosystem that includes AR and VR devices a new operating system “and digital commerce platform” among other facets. More details may be revealed or at least hinted at on Thursday at Facebook’s next AR/VR conference.

In a metaverse situation NFTs — whether for a digital sneaker 3D designer dress or some other virtual item that’s verifiable and therefore ownable and sellable — are primed for commerce.

Clinique apparently sees major opportunity in that though it still remains largely uncharted territory for beauty. In May Look Labs cast its fragrance Cyber Eau De Parfum as a digital asset and nail art has already begun dipping its perfectly manicured fingers into the tech. But apart from individual works there aren’t yet examples of any sustained efforts by a major beauty brand.

Without concrete examples to follow the company had to carve its own path forward. Dawkins said it knew it wanted to create something that was true to its brand prioritizing a “high tech meets high touch” experience so it used that as a north star.

“[We thought] ‘How do we craft something that’s of value and that’s desirable in the market today but turn it into something that has meaning for this consumer?’” she said. “So what we thought was most interesting is there’s a lot of currency and story out there at the moment. And consumers want to feel like they have a more active part of the brand.”

The MetaOptimist NFTs aren’t for sale but will be awarded through a social media campaign asking consumers to share their stories of optimism and hopes for the future. The three winners will be announced on Nov. 2 by global ambassadors Emilia Clarke and Melissa Barrera on the company’s social accounts. They will receive the NFT the physical Black Honey product and in a twist designed to deepen loyalty a decade’s worth of product meted out once per year over 10 years.

The details matter because they are the company’s way of translating rarity — the hallmark of NFTs — for the beauty business.

“One of the things that I’m convinced of is that the digital world ultimately mirrors the physical world” said Michael Smith chief information officer at Estée Lauder Companies which owns Clinique. “That idea of being able to have something unique where you have digital ownership and you have rarity and all the things that you want to do for a consumer from a loyalty standpoint this [NFT] enables that in the digital world and is able to create that sense of ownership in something that is truly a unique part of the brand heritage.

“That was why we zoned in on a loyalty use case specifically.”

As a whole Estée Lauder has ramped up its interests in technology in recent years from establishing its own IT-focused innovation lab to working with partners like Perfect Corp. on artificial intelligence-powered augmented reality makeup try-ons.

Now that Clinique has broken ground as the parent company’s first brand to take up NFTs it likely won’t be the last.

“One of the things that has happened with COVID-19 is our consumers are much more likely to adopt new technologies. They’re much more open [and] the expectation of what technology can enable has changed” he added. “And so we’re hyper-focused on making sure that we leverage the latest technologies to create new experiences maybe things that weren’t happening before and so we are working with our brand partners to identify where there might be value.”

As a major company with a portfolio that includes some of the world’s most recognizable names in beauty — including Aramis Origins MAC La Mer Bobbi Brown Aveda Jo Malone London Bumble and bumble and many more including its own namesake brand — its efforts could light the way forward for the whole industry’s pursuit of NFTs. Whether that path eventually leads to the metaverse remains to be seen. But it’s a step pointed in that direction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvbGl6LWh1cmxleS01Ni1vZmZlcnMtaGVhbHRoLTI1MzM1NTcx0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrLzNhbS9jZWxlYnJpdHktbmV3cy9saXotaHVybGV5LTU2LW9mZmVycy1oZWFsdGgtMjUzMzU1NzEuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liz Hurley 56 offers health and beauty self-care tips and her one 'food weakness',"Actress Liz Hurley opens up about her motivation behind 25 years as a breast cancer awareness advocate and why women 'familiarising themselves with their breasts' can save lives

After 26 years of being involved with the Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Campaign Elizabeth Hurley (Liz to us) remains passionate about the cause.

“Evelyn Lauder [Pink Ribbon Breast Health Awareness co-founder] tasked me to get involved in 1995 around the same time that I had just lost my beloved grandmother to breast cancer” the actress says.

“I immediately said yes knowing how close this was to me and my family. Evelyn recognised that women around the world were dying and no one was talking about it and she wanted

to change that.”

Liz 56 who lives in Herefordshire is as close as ever to Damian her 19-year-old son from her relationship with the late US businessman Steve Bing. And even though Damian now has his

own career as a model she still likes to keep

tabs on him.

“I torture him by making him text me and check in all the time. There’s a lot of eye-rolling from his end” she has previously said. “Given I’m a single mother and he’s an only child by default we do spend a lot of time together and we’re utterly comfortable in each other’s company. I rather think I’ve simply been blessed with a child whose personality gels with mine.”

Here Liz talks about the importance of women giving their boobs a regular check and her secrets to staying healthy…

Hi Liz. You lost your grandmother to breast cancer and Sarah Harding ’s death from it at only 39 was tragic…

Breast cancer doesn’t discriminate. At one time I had four girlfriends all mothers battling this disease. We are all vulnerable. Every time

I hear of a new diagnosis – whether I know the person or not – I feel inspired to keep going and raise more funds

and greater awareness.

What advice would you give to others about self-checking breasts?

Self-checking is really important. I have personally met many women who have discovered lumps themselves including several of my close

friends. By familiarising yourself with your own breasts it should become easier to spot or feel any changes.

Image: @elizabethhurley1) @elizabethhurley1)

What is the best method for carrying out self-checks ?

I recently took part in a virtual self-check

event with Alesha Dixon and Dr Zoe Williams an NHS doctor who gives wonderful online demonstrations on how best to do it. The aim was to break a world record for the largest self-check event ever.

Do mammograms hurt?

Evelyn Lauder gifted me my first mammogram for my 40th birthday. I’m happy to report they are not at all painful just a bit uncomfortable.

Are you terrified of what they’ll find when you go for yours?

Waiting for the result of anything medical is always a bit nerve-racking but at least if you self-check and have regular mammograms if something is found it hopefully will have been caught early. We know early detection saves lives as breast cancer mortality rates have decreased by 41% among women since the late 1980s because of earlier detection and improved treatment.

Do you feel your own boobs for lumps and bumps?

I self-check in front of the mirror. It’s important to remember to do it at the same time

of the month each month as your breasts fluctuate due to hormonal changes. I self-check on the first of every month.

Your wardrobe must be stuffed full of pink dresses the campaign colour for the Estée Lauder campaign…

Luckily I adore pink. I borrow most of my dazzling pink costumes so sadly they’re not hanging in my closet. Brands are wonderfully supportive because everyone knows someone who has been affected by breast cancer and most people want to help.

What are your tips for continuing to look so amazing at 56?

I eat quite a lot but rarely eat junk or processed foods I don’t eat takeaways only drink sodas once in a blue moon and don’t drink much alcohol. I try to eat lots of vegetables and try not to eat between meals. My weakness is peanut butter – if it’s in

Do you still chew food 40 times before swallowing as you once claimed?

It’s important to chew but I doubt if I’ve ever made it to 40 chews a morsel – not sure where you got that from! I rarely think I’m on a diet but sometimes when I see what some people eat I realise that

Adirondack Council Hires Blake Neumann as Clean Water Advocate

The Adirondack Council announced another important addition to its rapidly expanding Conservation Team team Blake Neumann who will fill the newly created role of Clean Water Advocate.

Neumann will work with local partners to develop and implement water quality protection and aquatic invasive species management strategies for Raquette Lake and surrounding watersheds.

“This is a big step for the Adirondack Council and the Park” said Executive Director William C. Janeway. “Our main office in Essex County makes it easy for our staff to keep tabs on what is happening in the Lake Champlain and Hudson River watersheds but not so easy to interact with scientists advocates and residents in the northwestern Adirondacks where the lakes and rivers flow to Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. We are also concerned with the future of the Moose River and Fulton Chain Lakes. We are thrilled that our supporters have made it possible for us to assign full time staff to this vital task.

“It is easy to overlook just how large the Adirondack Park really is” Janeway said. “It is bigger for example than Massachusetts and Rhode Island combined. So it is essential that the Park’s largest environmental organization have a physical presence in several locations. We have wanted to expand into the Raquette Lake and the Old Forge/Inlet area for some time.”

Neumann comes to the Adirondack Council from Green Bay Wisc. where he was working on water quality projects with The Nature Conservancy. There he was working to bridge funding gaps and guide strategic planning for flood resilience measures on a watershed scale.

Neumann also brings expertise from his work at the United States Environmental Protection Agency where he coordinated research and outreach activities. Neumann holds a Master’s degree in Water and Wetland Resource Studies from the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and a Master’s of Public Administration and Environmental Policy from Syracuse University.

Over its two-decade long journey the brand has come a long way from just 50 soaps made by squeezing fresh honey for friends and family to its partnership with the Estee Lauder Companies in 2008 making it the first Indian brand in the global beauty brands roster.

Today Forest Essentials is the largest player in the luxury hotel amenities and spa business catering to over 500 hospitality chains and retailing from 100 exclusive stores operational in 29 cities across the country. It has a major online business and exports to over 120 countries. It is also poised to be the first luxury Indian skincare brand to go global. In October it made its debut in the UK and is now available exclusively on Looksfantastic.com Europe's leading online beauty retailer.

The company reported net revenues of over Rs 253 crore in 2020 an increase of over 25 per cent compared to the previous year and aims to become a billion-dollar brand. Business Today spoke to Forest Essentials Managing Director Samrath Bedi on the impact of the pandemic on the business bounce-back expansion plans and trends in skincare. Here are the edited excerpts:

How did the pandemic impact business?

As India witnessed a second wave of Covid-19 and went into one of the strictest lockdowns this year we as a company were particularly affected given most of our business is consumer facing.



While our online business has increased substantially with regard to stores being shut as the country begins to open up we can now see some level of normalcy. We have always been confident about our offline business. While many companies downscaled and reduced their number of stores and retail presence we as a brand have taken decisions where we actually increased our retail exposure. We found that the pandemic gave us an opportunity to open stores in several more locations and cities at better rents and because of the confidence in our brand and what we bring to the table we have strongly expanded our business both offline and online.



Recognising the need for quicker online deliveries the brand has expanded its warehouse footprint to all the major metro cities to offer same day or next day deliveries to most of its customers.

A significant trend that we have noticed since the onset of the pandemic is that consumers are no longer ignorant of manufacturing processes and are rethinking and re-prioritising their consumption patterns to become more responsible towards society and the environment.

Additionally the raised awareness around human rights and climate change has led consumers to be more selective and demanding of business practices by prioritising brands that value transparency and are purpose-led in their messaging and authenticity. Moreover customers are looking for carefully curated and thought-out retail experiences that are distinct while being efficacious. There has been an increased emphasis on personalised products that work to target an individual's specific skincare needs.



How has growth been in the first two quarters of the current year? Are you back to pre-pandemic levels? If not what is the expectation?

We as a brand increased our retail presence amidst challenging times and actually opened 21 new stores between the period of July 2020 and August 2021. Our brand market share was 30 per cent pre-Covid. This is for the prestige/luxury Ayurveda segment. Now our brand market share is higher given we have opened a number of stores and also grown the online business significantly. Our year-on-year growth post-Covid (last two years) would be about 40 per cent.



There has been a growth of +17 per cent over the last year in total sales. This is inclusive of all verticals including FFS (Free Standing Stores) sales from the French multinational chain Sephora e-commerce travel retail and institutional sales.



Our online sales via e-store/website have grown exponentially in the last year with an approximate 300 per cent jump from May 2020 till date. 52 per cent of our customers are repeat consumers who typically place an order every month. 70 per cent of our website visitors are new visitors who contribute to 48 per cent of the business where on an average a customer is adding more than one full size product.



What are the new trends in luxury skincare? Have you seen demand for certain products go up during the pandemic?

Today's consumer is actively embracing purpose and sustainability-driven products in a conscious effort to support environmental causes.



With people spending more time indoors there was a sharp rise in the demand for skincare and especially wellness products predominantly products that are ""clean"" -- non-toxic unadulterated and manufactured without parabens sulphates and other harmful ingredients.

With the onset of the pandemic customers are looking for carefully curated and thought-out retail experiences that are distinct while being efficacious. There has been an increased emphasis on personalised products that work to target an individual's specific skincare concerns. In tandem with that we have witnessed a shift in the beauty space with an increased focus on skincare as a product category with a simultaneous rise in skincare-infused makeup a new category that we were thrilled to foray into in December 2020.



What are your expansion plans?

We have a strong network of over 100 standalone stores across 29 cities in India with our standalone store presence growing each year. We service our customers across the globe through our e-commerce website. Our global expansion has begun with the UK this year and we are looking at expanding to the Middle East South-East Asia and United States in the next few years.



You have recently launched online in the UK? Why was the UK selected as your first international market?

The beauty industry in India and in the UK have a familiar approach to beauty with people from both countries being selective and discerning with their choices and investments prioritising brands that value transparency and ethics. These are values we have pioneered since our inception making the UK the ideal first choice of our international foray.



Will you be opening a store there?

The drastic rise in online consumption and by leveraging the power of our digital ecosystem we took the strategic decision of launching through an e-tailer in the UK. To this end we will be launching digitally with Europe's number one online premium beauty retailer Look Fantastic in October 2021. Look Fantastic belongs to The Hut Group which recently bought over Cult Beauty adding to the Group's meteoric rise.

Carrying over 22000 products with complimentary worldwide shipping to over 200 countries Look Fantastic has become the online partner of choice for many leading brands. With a portfolio of over 660 premium brands onsite and revenue shares growing 40 per cent year-on-year in the last four years launching Forest Essentials on one of the most successful beauty websites globally was keeping in line with our brand's strategic international expansion plans. We will take our learnings from this and look at opening stores physically a year or two down the line.



Are you looking at introducing a new range of products?

Our iconic product ranges across facial care hair care body care men's collection as well as an extensive gifting range will be available for purchase in the UK. This will include our innovative Soundarya collection crafted with 24 karat gold. Other signature collections offered on the site include the Madurai Jasmine & Mogra Oudh & Green Tea Kashmiri Nargis Sandalwood and Indian Rose Absolute.



In terms of product offerings for the UK market we are stocking all our key collections and iconic products. Our first objective is to establish Forest Essentials as a luxury beauty brand within the UK market and thereby internationally. In that regard we are launching in a two-phased approach by introducing our product range in stages and launching our much-loved Natural Makeup Collection in the next phase.

Andrea Karkafi is stitching her way to success.

The third-year communication and psychology student created her business Los Angeles Embroidery during the pandemic out of boredom and an eagerness to find a hobby that channeled her creative expression she said. After learning how to stitch over the course of five months Karkafi said she began selling embroidery hoops tote bags and wallets through Etsy and Instagram. Now she said her business mainly focuses on embroidery hoops for wall decor that she can create with a couple of tools.

“I wanted a hobby that was … something I could really take and be really creative with” Karkafi said. “I’m not an artist – I don’t draw or paint or play musical instruments so (embroidery) is really something that allowed me to be super creative and get my ideas out there.”

Karkafi’s business journey began when she was inspired by her family to learn how to embroider particularly when she frequently drove from Los Angeles to Texas to practice stitching with her aunt and grandma she said. For details such as basic stitches Karkafi said she used YouTube and Pinterest for practice and inspiration. Once she felt ready Karkafi said she began sketching her own designs such as her home collection and her best-selling zodiac car charms.

The process begins with designing an idea on the app Notability using her iPad. She said she finds her inspiration from current trends or large fanbases. She said she then places the design in a wooden hoop and uses cotton fabric as well as string to embroider it all together in a process that can range from a couple of days to a week. The product is finished once she creates a backing for the hoop which has her logo and name on it Karkafi said.

Her newest project a home collection is a special interior design set that she is currently creating to put in different rooms throughout the house such as one of a living room with a TV and a sofa she said. Karkafi’s favorite work so far however has been her zodiac car charms which she said are also the only items that are made to order on her Etsy.

“(Customers) can choose their zodiac sign and I embroider it onto a small three-inch-diameter hoop” Karkafi said. “It’s a constellation and then I put little stars around it on black fabric.”

While creating the hoops is fun for Karkafi one hurdle she had to overcome was branding her business she said. When starting out Karkafi said she did extensive research on marketing and found that spreading her business through word-of-mouth was most effective. Her cousin Muriel Lussier was someone Karkafi went to often for advice on styling her account she said. Lussier who works in media relations and communications in New York City said a key aspect for Karkafi to focus on was making sure she was consistent with how she told her story online.

“A lot of the stuff that we talked about was around making sure she was consistent with the look and feel of her Instagram – the way she talks about the products and the customization that she does” Lussier said.

Another customer who has been Karkafi’s supporter is her friend Isis Doss-Wassily a third-year human biology and society student. Doss-Wassily had bought a hoop from Karkafi before she had her Etsy store set up and she said the process was professional despite the two being close friends.

“She treated me as she would any other customer” Doss-Wassily said. “She put so much effort into it and I still have the laminated thank-you card.”

From starting on Instagram to transitioning to Etsy Karkafi said she is excited to see where her business can go from here. She said she has seen plenty of embroidery artists who use their talent to create full-time jobs for themselves and she would also appreciate having her hobby as a part-time job in the future. Karkafi is excited to keep improving her artwork she said specifically through stitching more intricate and complex details.

“It’s been really fun” Karkafi said. “Making something out of nothing is the coolest part for me – making something before when it didn’t exist and then I created it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdHJpb3RsZWRnZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC8zMC9hcnRpc3RyeS1hbmQtaGlzdG9yeS1tZWV0LWhhbm92ZXItd2VhdmVyLWNsYWlyZS1oYXNzZXR0LzYwMzUyNjcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artistry and history meet in Hanover weaver Claire Hassett,"HANOVER – Claire Hassett is an old soul.

She lives in a 200-year-old home with original wood beam ceilings works partially out of a 19th-century two-story barn and is just as happy to open a window and listen to birds chirping as she is to throw on a podcast.

But where her true appreciation for history and tradition shines is her artistry.

Hassett a weaver owns Barn Door Arts a brand through which she sells pottery and woven kitchen and tea towels. For the last year and a half she's focused primarily on her weaving and mastered using traditional looms to create linen and cotton towels with a connection to the craftsmanship of yesteryear.

""It does remind me of the Colonial era"" she said on a recent morning in her living room. ""I love playing with the different colors I can combine and I like being able to coordinate it with existing décor. It's so customizable and I can make it whatever I like.""

The pottery she sells is hers too though her focus is largely weaving these days.

Now retired Hassett picked up weaving at the insistence of a neighbor who loved the hobby. Her mother owned a craft store and she's always had her hand in something she said but she never thought weaving is where her passion would lie.

The towels Hassett makes are a long way from what is sold in big-box stores. It takes a whole day for Hassett to simply dress her loom a process of stretching spools of thread from her living room to her kitchen before it's ready to use. She works on two looms one in her backyard barn and one in her living room.

Once the loom is ready the act of weaving is a physical one that requires two hands one foot and a painstaking attention to detail. From afar it looks like it would be easy to slip into a mindless pattern of throwing the boat shuttle stepping on the treadles and repeating the process over and over again.

And while Hassett said it is rhythmic it doesn't afford the luxury of letting the mind wander. She may turn on music or a podcast but she can never truly focus on something else.

""It's meditative but also requires strict attention"" she explained. ""The edges need to be even missing a thread is a very obvious mistake and the warp and weft need to be even.""

She's made tablecloths tea towels table runners and more but her most popular item is everyday kitchen towels which can take two hours to make. Her patterns are pretty and relatively simple and many are inspired by things Hassett sees and loves.

One towel for example is inspired by her sister's home in the Smoky Mountains: greens and blues represent a stream near the house. Her sons – including Marshfield's Levitate owner Dan Hassett – love to surf and she has towels with sandy tan turquoise blue for the ocean and white to represent crashing waves.

""I pay attention to the interactions of the colors the textures. There is a lot of thought that goes into them and they are truly made with love"" she said.

Hassett sells her work at Artisans In the Square in Hingham and Local Pottery in Norwell and has had several conversations with shoppers who can't believe anyone uses a loom anymore. The towels cost between $35 and $50. Hassett says some people use them as everyday items and to others they are decorative one-of-a-kind pieces.

""People are shocked. When I first went in people thought I was embroidering existing towels and I had to say 'No no. It started with a spool of thread'"" she said. ""They're amazthat it is made from scratch.""

Pottery and woven items from Barn Door Arts are also available on Etsy.

U of T student Sana Khan is combining her love for both. As a medical and scientific illustrator Khan uses anatomy sketches animation and 3D technology to present complex diagrams to people without a scientific background. However Khan is also leaning into her artistic side by selling her pieces as decorative works on her Etsy shop.

The Varsity interviewed Khan to discuss her artistic training her career and her opinion on the divide between art and science.

The Varsity: What do medical and scientific illustrators do?

Sana Khan: Our main job is to basically translate complex scientific information into a visual form so that it’s easier to understand. This is especially important in this day and age when all this complex research is coming out but then there’s no way to convey it to the public. It’s our job to fill in the gap between science and the public.

TV: How did you get into medical and scientific illustrating?

SK: I’ve been making art for as long as I can remember. In middle school I would participate in art clubs and art contests. During my undergrad I stopped for a bit to focus on the science side so I did my specialist in neuroscience at UTM and then I found out about [U of T’s Masters program in biomedical communications] that merged the art and the science together.

TV: How did you learn to make sketches? Did you take any kind of formal or informal education certifications or classes?

SK: I was able to learn how to draw but I had no formal education so I guess I would say I’m self-taught because it just came with a lot of practice. I’m a very detail-oriented person and a perfectionist so when I’m creating my drawings I pay a lot of attention to detail and that takes a ton of patience — something I’m still learning how to do. I think observational drawing really helped me a lot because I would sit down and draw whatever was in front of me and that’s how you get better at it.

TV: Is making these illustrations a hobby for you or more of a career?

SK: I have an Etsy store where I sell anatomy prints and drawings I made as part of my coursework. Some of them I made just for fun and that part is more of a luxury. People buy that and hang it up and it’s just nice to look at. But then there’s the whole field of medical illustration and animation where you design visuals for textbooks companies for hospitals or for patient education and that’s what I would say where my career is.

TV: What’s your creative process like when you’re starting to sketch?

SK: The first stage would be the research stage where I would gather all my visual references especially if I’m drawing something hyperrealistic. When you’re doing hyperrealistic art you have to pay attention to a lot of detail which requires a lot of references.

If I’m designing an infographic for something space-related I’d have to do all the science-related research about space and then I would have to do the visual research. So gathering other space infographics and seeing what the artists came up with is more science-oriented than the stuff that I produce for the actual field rather than just my coursework.

TV: How do you think technology intersects with this art and the field of scientific illustration as a whole?

SK: I would say it’s very tech-heavy. As of maybe ten years ago there’s a huge focus on 3D animation and replicating the real life mechanisms of our bodies and molecules. There’s a lot of digital drawing. I wouldn’t say traditional art is dying. It’s still part of the process especially the preliminary phase when you’re starting to sketch out your ideas.

TV: How do you think that the field of scientific illustrators bridges the age-old ‘art or science’ debate?

SK: There are people who always try to identify themselves as more artistically inclined versus more analytically inclined; the field that I’m in merges both of them. If I’m drawing from a reference I have to learn to break down that reference into pieces. Even though the final result that you produce is very different the process in order to get to that final stage is very similar.

It almost wrecked him. The music especially the later works are psychologically dense to say the least. Ludwig van Beethoven was not the first composer to live through anguish and despair in his physical and mental health but he was the first to reflect it so profoundly and directly in his music.

In his new audio memoir Unquiet: My Life With Beethoven Jonathan Biss talks about how the journey through the sonatas challenged his own mental health and struggle with anxiety. He also has a new concert recorded at GBH that you can stream online starting this weekend at GBH.org. Biss joined Arun Rath on GBH’s All Things Considered to discuss Beethoven’s works and the toll that it took on him.

Listen to the attached audio to hear snippets of Biss’s performances in the interview. What follows is a lightly edited trancript.

Arun Rath: So as we're going to talk about Beethoven and mental health and your journey with Beethoven I think for people who may not be familiar it's helpful to to set the stage — what it means for a pianist to take on all 32 of Beethoven's sonatas. Because for people who know Beethoven he started his life and ended his life with a piano right? And all of the drama and intense emotion from lost loves through losing his hearing it's all in that music right?

Jonathan Biss: Yeah I'm hardly the first pianist to call the 32 Beethoven sonatas the Mount Everest of the repertoire and I think it's an apt description for many reasons. I mean obviously just first of all the sheer volume of music I mean 32 pieces almost none of which are small the incredible variety of expression of structure of character in the music.

But I think maybe more than either of those things is the incredible intensity of Beethoven's personality. There's really nothing else in music that's like it the extent to which he forces you to invest every ounce of yourself your intellectual self your psychic self. So I mean playing all of these feels like a profound undertaking to play — all 32 of them is wonderful but utterly overwhelming.

Rath: You have this line — we'll talk about how it came to a point of even emotional breakdown for you. But even before that you have this line that's actually in your audio book it's very dramatic. I bet if I started you maybe even could finish it. That's on April 24th 2007...

Biss: Beethoven's Sonata Opus 109 made me lose my mind. I mean as funny of a thing as it is that I'm about to say given that the line is a dramatic line I feel like choosing that sonata in that recording session that day was in a sense arbitrary. Because there were so many moments and there have been so many moments in my life with Beethoven where I felt like the desire to say something about his music that was true and that conveyed the essence of it — in all of its as I said intensity and all of its profundity — that my desire to do that and the difficulty of doing it really just started to seem more than I could bear.

Rath: Well it's interesting to use this phrase ""lose my mind."" And there are other places where I notice you talk about losing yourself in Beethoven and in this music. How did that happen? I mean you know we can listen to this music and hear the intensity of it. But when you're playing it what's going on?

Biss: I think that that thing — of feeling like I was losing myself — is very much connected to him. Because again I think his personality is so enormous and also I would say so belligerent. He again in a way that I would not say was true of any other composer certainly not to the same degree he takes up a lot of space. You know this is a person who had a very unhappy personal life. A composer who recognized that he was losing his hearing from around the age of 30 already and who wrote to his brothers that the only thing keeping him alive was this need to communicate through the medium of music. And you hear that you feel that when you listen to — or play — his music. You feel the sort of life-or-death quality in the way the music comes out of him.

And when faced with that you feel like your whole being becomes kind of consumed with him and his needs and attempting to bring that essence to life. And if you aren't careful sometimes it means there's no corner of the room left for yourself. And I feel like I wasn't attuned enough to myself to sort of guard against the dangers inherent in taking on a personality of that enormity and that intensity.

Rath: Let's get to an example of that intensity. And set up brilliantly you're recording a pretty famous piece: the Waldstein Sonata that's Opus 53. And I gotta say Jonathan your recording of this I think is my favorite version of it. It's a piece that we'll hear as it starts off. Everybody who plays it sounds you know intriguing and hear that emotionality. Let's hear a little bit of your recording and then we'll talk about it.

Musical interlude listening to a snippet from Biss’s performance of the Waldstein Sonata.

Tell me if you think I'm wrong headed in hearing this but when I hear this you playing it there's something scarier here than I hear in most versions. It feels like other versions feel a little bit safe compared to this.

Biss: Oh wow thank you. I'm happy to hear that — I know that 'happy' sounds like a funny word to use in this context. But I do think one of the signature qualities of the Waldstein Sonata — and maybe sometimes underplayed — is there's a sense of wonder in it that comes through sort of from the first notes. And I think that that wonder is maybe threatening at times to go in a darker direction.

I mean certainly there's a way in which — you hear this from the first phrase — that the music is often really quite evenly poised between the major and the minor. It happens again in the last movement there is this sense of being in some kind of no man's land between the two modes.

Rath: It takes me right to these two phrases that also stick out from your audiobook where you're talking about your own troubles with anxiety and you say ""Anxiety is complicated Beethoven is complicated.""

Biss: Yeah absolutely. And I mean the maybe most important thing that I've had to do to come to terms with my anxiety was to stop wishing or hoping that it would simply go away. Living with it when you're particularly prone to it as I would say I am is it about accepting it as an integral part of yourself and learning how to recognize the point where you cross that line from it being a healthy motivating life force and then turning into a monster that might eat you. It's really hard to do that when you're working on Beethoven because Beethoven asks you to throw caution to the wind.

Rath: It sounds like you've come to a point now where you're able to function and you're still able to play Beethoven.

Biss: No I feel much more able to play him now that I'm kind of in balance as a person. Performers have been trained — to our detriment — to believe that if you have any difficulty handling your emotions you're ill suited to your job. And so I think for so many years I felt like to say ""I have anxiety"" was really just another set of words to say ""I'm a failure in my chosen profession."" And I had to get past that which was hard! And it took a long long time and it took me hitting what I would personally call my bottom to be able to sort of say ""I have a problem."" So that was the first and I think I would still say the most difficult step.

Rath: Jonathan has been a real pleasure speaking with you. Thank you so much.

Biss: Oh it's my pleasure. Thank you for having me.

Several Days After Nor'easter Hit,"Eversource and National Grid said that power has been restored for most Massachusetts residents who were left in the dark after a powerful nor'easter slammed the state Tuesday night into Wednesday.

As of 8 a.m. Sunday just under 5700 customers were still without electricity statewide according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.

Some towns on Saturday were still dealing with widespread outages. Plympton was the worst hit town on the South Shore with about 87% of the town still without power.

In Pembroke homeowners had waited for their power to return as heavy downpours headed toward the area Saturday.

“There’s people in my neighborhood that are still without power; you can hear the generators running” Art Mahoney said.

The town of Plympton still has 87% of customers without power this Saturday morning. It’s the worst hit town on the south shore in terms of outages. Even in the fire department parking lot we saw Eversource crews working on wires at 4am. @NBC10Boston pic.twitter.com/9Uotwxu4I5 — Kirsten Glavin (@kirstenglavin) October 30 2021

The outage numbers had dropped to just 18000 by 6 p.m. with officials saying most everyone should have their electricity restored by midnight. That's down from a high of 700000 outages across the state during the height of the storm on Wednesday.

""I think our goal all along we wanted Sunday to be Halloween and for kids and adults to be able to enjoy it as they should be able to"" said Gov. Charlie Baker who toured storm damage and met with Eversource officials in Marshfield Saturday. ""Let's face it -- it's been a long time since anybody's had what we would describe as a normal Halloween.""

Eversource and National Grid expect most people in Massachusetts should have power restored by midnight Saturday.

Today I met with utility workers and public safety officials working around the clock to restore power and repair damage in communities that were heavily impacted by this week's storm.

The fire chief in Plymouth has been speaking out this week trying to get more power company crews out to help with the restoration efforts.

On Saturday morning Eversource crews were working on restoring a power line right in the Plympton Fire Department's parking lot.

Later Saturday Chief Stephen Silva told NBC10 Boston that utility crews moved at an impressive pace just hours after most of the town sat in the dark.

“Amazing! This time yesterday 97 percent of the town was out of power” he said.

Thousands of people continue to be without electricity in Massachusetts. Power is expected to be restored by Saturday.

Some other towns in the area also still had people wake up without electricity on Saturday morning.

Cohassett and Norwell were two big ones. In many of these heavily wooded communities they're still working to clean up fallen trees.

""Awful. You never know what you have until you miss it and it's gone and here we are"" said Donna Wallace of Hingham. ""No lights no food nothing you know. You have to throw everything out and it's starting all over again.""

Baker said Saturday that he was satisficed with the speed of restoration efforts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2FyZWhhbS50aGV3ZWVrdG9kYXkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2xlYW4tcG93ZXItcmVzdG9yYXRpb24tZWZmb3J0cy1vbmdvaW5nLWFjcm9zcy10b3duLzU1NDQ20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clean-up power restoration efforts ongoing across town,"Days after a powerful nor’easter blew through town efforts to clean up debris and restore power to businesses and residences continued on Saturday Oct. 30.

The town opened its brush pile — which is only ordinarily open on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month — from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. A Municipal Maintenance employee said the brush pile located at 95 Charge Pond Rd. saw more than 100 people by his estimate. He also noted that some Wareham residents made multiple trips.

At 8 a.m. he said the line of cars waiting to drop off tree limbs fallen trees and other lawn debris stretched through the Municipal Maintenance lot and down Charge Pond Road to the overpass.

Tim Feeny was at the brush pile emptying a truck bed full of tree broken branches and brush. Just after 1 p.m. Feeny was already on his fourth and final trip to the brush pile. He said there was a lot of damage to the trees in his neighborhood of Dinahs Way.

“I just can’t believe it’s not even winter yet and we’re doing this” he said gesturing to his pile of branches and the piles on other trucks and trailers nearby.

Feeny’s home was without power from about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday until about 6 p.m. Friday. Even with a generator he said it was “very difficult.”

Fara and Kevin Padden were on their second trip to the brush pile by a little after 1 p.m. They said Agawam Beach where they live experienced a good amount of tree damage mostly broken tree limbs.

“It’s just a mess” Fara Padden said.

Their power had gone out during the storm but was restored Thursday afternoon she said.

Shangri La resident Paul LeBeau said his yard was full of broken branches and tree limbs after the storm. The nor’easter knocked out the power at his home for two days and a falling branch took off one of the mirrors on his truck. Despite being down a mirror LeBeau drove a truckload of broken tree branches and other debris to the brush pile on Saturday.

“It could have been worse” he said with a laugh. “I could have been walking to get rid of this stuff.”

Utility crews were also hard at work all around town. Eversource said it had thousands of staff working to restore the power — including “line and tree crews damage assessors troubleshooters substation electricians and wire guards as well as logistics and other support staff.”

As of 6:45 p.m. on Saturday the Eversource outage map indicated that just over 100 of its nearly 15000 customers were still without power. It is unclear whether those customers have been without power since the nor’easter hit or if they were impacted by strong winds after the Tuesday/Wednesday storm.

Over the course of the day Saturday Eversource restored power to more than 3000 customers.

On Thursday Oct. 28 Town Administrator Derek Sullivan said that town buildings escaped the storm mostly unscathed but a number of shingles were blown off the Multiservice Center roof.

The historic Tremont Nail Factory property also appeared to have sustained some damage particularly to the signage.

The Wareham Land Trust saw significant storm damage to some of its preserves. At least 20 trees fell across trails at Fearing Hill while about 10 fell across trails at the Douglas S. Westgate. Less than 10 fell at Tweedy and Barnes.

Because the Fearing Hill and Westgate preserves are town property Land Trust President Kathy Pappalardo said that cleaning up the trails is the town’s responsibility. Although volunteers will likely help out it could be some time before the trails are fully cleared.

Cape Cod Times

HYANNIS — The ferocity of Wednesday’s nor’easter and the extent of damage it caused caught many on the Cape by surprise regardless of how many big storms they had seen come and go. The storm intensified rapidly Tuesday night and blasted the Cape and Islands plunging nearly 80% of homes and businesses into instant darkness.

Experts said the forecasters got it right but that many people didn’t read the fine print or were lulled into complacency after prior storms didn’t deliver on predictions of wind and flooding.

Charles Orloff executive director at the Blue Hills Observatory and Science Center in Milton was at Hyannis Yacht Club Tuesday evening and there was little indication that a major storm was approaching.

More:Here are the wind gusts reported on Cape Cod during the storm

“They (the people at the club) were all pooh-poohing it” said Orloff. “They were saying this is going to be a flop.”

The ""bomb cyclone"" nor'easter slammed into the Cape and Island taking down hundreds of trees power lines and damaging cellphone fiber networks. Thousands of Eversource customers were left without power.

Joe Nolan president and CEO of the utility pledged Thursday that 98% of Cape and Martha's Vineyard customers would have power restored by 6 p.m. Saturday.

""We are not going to sleep until every customer is on” he said during a Friday press conference in Falmouth. ""This is one of the largest efforts that Eversource has been involved in for quite some time and it is going very very smoothly.”

Botched hurricane forecast led Cape Codders to ignore nor'easter warning

Sandy Harrison a cashier at Bradford’s Hardware in Hyannis felt a botched forecast on Hurricane Henri this August in which predictions of 90 mph winds manifested as 30 to 40 mph winds instead played into that complacency.

“The last hurricane we were supposed to have we really didn’t get” Harrison said Friday. “This (the nor’easter) was supposed to start Tuesday afternoon and it didn’t … We didn’t know it was going to be this bad and a lot of people were stunned by that.”

Darin Krum the owner of Eastham ACE Hardware said that sometimes “the media really hype up the storms and then (they) fizzle out.”

“This time I don't think they were hyping it up but we've been on a roll of storms fizzling out and this one didn't” he said.

Krum said there’s been a run on chainsaws since Thursday.

“We sold more than a dozen which is highly unusual. You try to get your customers to be a little more proactive and to buy these supplies before the demand hits and it's too late. We try to drill that home to people so they're not caught with their pants down when disaster hits” said Krum.

Storm 'worst we've seen in a while'

“The storm was the worst we’ve seen in a while and there was no indication it was going to be that bad” Bourne Assistant Fire Chief David Pelonzi said Friday.

Chatham Deputy Chief of Police Michael Anderson and Mashpee Fire Chief Thomas Rullo agreed that the winds were stronger than expected.

Cape Cod school superintendents are by necessity among the savviest on following late-breaking weather developments. Make the wrong call — close schools for an inch of snow when the forecast said a foot — and you’re pilloried from newsprint to social media.

Upper Cape Regional Technical School Superintendent Roger Forget admitted to being surprised.

“I don’t think we quite expected this” he said. “This is a hell of a storm.”

Barnstable School Superintendent Meg Mayo-Brown said that as the storm approached Tuesday night she thought it would only cause a two-hour delay in the start of school Wednesday. By 4 a.m. she knew school had to be canceled.

“To me it's people not really paying attention not listening to what people are saying” said Orloff. He pointed out that 24 hours before the storm struck the Cape NOAA’s National Weather Service website was predicting winds in the 70s and their written discussion indicated the possibility of stronger winds.

“They shouldn’t have been that surprised. This was a very strong storm maybe stronger than what they thought but I think the National Weather Service and the Weather Channel did a wonderful job on this” said Orloff.

Even veteran meteorologist caught off guard

But even veteran meteorologist Tim Kelley who ranks this nor’easter as the most powerful and punishing non-winter storm to hit the region since the so-called ""Perfect Storm"" of 1991 went to bed Tuesday night in his Dennis home suspecting he might be underwhelmed in the morning.

With the wind speeds at NOAA buoys at 30 knots 25% below what was predicted conditions didn’t seem that bad. Just before bed at 10 p.m. he tweeted out a message that cited upper atmosphere conditions and wondered if the storm might actually be a bust.

“I instantly regretted it” Kelley said Friday.

This was a storm that wasn’t visible on any weather maps until it all came together Tuesday said Kelley. A confluence of three low-pressure systems converged on a spot about 90 to 100 miles south of Nantucket known as The Benchmark where some of the worst most dangerous New England storms originate.

The newly formed storm fed in part by warm Gulf Stream water bumped up against a cold front just west of the Cape that extended over most of New England. The storm track was a tight loop that went east north and then southwest coming unusually close to Nantucket said Kelley.

By midnight the upper and lower atmosphere winds had aligned in a vertical stack like a big rotor pumping out wind and moving toward Nantucket churning out 60 to 70 mph winds.

“It didn’t take long for Mother Nature to shake me” said Kelley. Around 2 a.m. he awoke to a gust that shook the house.

High velocity wind gusts shook houses

“That was a top 10 kind of gust and I hear all these noises and then the power went out at 3 a.m.” he said. “The storm was deepening and retrograding (traveling back towards the Cape) and people on Twitter were asking me how much longer the wind would continue.”

Even as it headed back out to sea the storm continued to pummel the Cape Kelley said. Like an ice skater coming out of a spin hands held tight to turn faster then extended outward as the spin slows the storm expanded as it weakened and moved away with high winds continuing to shake the Cape into Thursday.

Chatham Harbormaster Stu Smith said that while most commercial fishermen had moved their vessels to storm moorings in Ryder Cove and Stage Harbor many recreational boat owners reluctant to end their boating season after great October weather kept their vessels in the water. Smith said 15 boats were blown off moorings onto the Chatham shoreline. He and his staff launched in winds gusting to 50 mph Wednesday to help two fishermen rescue their vessels.

“It was awful” Smith said Friday. “The intensity of the wind prediction just came a little later in the game than we typically would get from a nor’easter that forms (off the Mid-Atlantic states). This thing happened so quickly that the people who lingered got into a bad position.”

That's the main difference between the $500 (£450 AU$749) Xbox Series X and $300 (£250 AU$499) Xbox Series S. Unless your life is ruled by FOMO if money is any object the console choice clearly comes down to talking yourself into buying the Series X rather than talking yourself out of it. And If you want a fan model like the Xbox Series X Halo Infinite Limited Edition your only choice is the Series X; it's in preorder now and slated to ship in early November.

If you want one of the consoles now though or are trying to decide between the two for holiday gift giving note that both are in short supply but it's easier to find the Series S than the Series X. Newbie gamers will likely be happy with the S. But a lot of more seasoned gamers pooh-pooh the Series S with its lesser storage capacity and components as not a very future-proof choice.

Yes technically the Xbox Series X has more memory and beefier processing components that run at faster speeds than the Series S but it's all in service of hitting 4K and 120 frames per second while gaming without upscaling. Or it's 8K/60 frames per second with it -- if you think you need it.

The Series S' target of 1440p and 120 fps is a lot less demanding hence its lower-power components and smaller body. For streaming video the Series X can do native 4K and upscale to 8K while the series S upscales to 4K.

Watch this: Xbox Series X and Series S Offer a Fine-Tuned Streamlined Xbox Experience 05:19

The Series S comes with only 512GB of SSD storage compared with the Series X's 1TB but thanks to Smart Delivery games optimized for the new consoles won't take up as much space on the Series S as the Series X. If you want to keep a lot of big games on deck and in progress the Series S supports the same Velocity Architecture for SSD expansion either via swapping the NVMe or the pricey (relative to the price of the console) Seagate 1TB plug-in card. Whizzy new game features are designed to be compatible with both and they have the same support for the new wireless controller and other peripherals.

Microsoft's offering both with its two year Xbox All Access bundles -- that's its plan for leasing an Xbox plus a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate -- with the Series X for $35 a month and the Series S for $25.

Microsoft Xbox Series S The biggest challenge for a living-room-bound Series S is finding a TV that supports the 1440p maximum resolution natively rather than forcing it to dial back to 1080p. Most TVs do 1080p or 4K (or both). But if the console is cohabiting with your workspace there are a ton of compatible monitors you can connect to it. The Series X may look better but if you're playing on a monitor-sized screen you won't miss the 4K as much. The Series S is a much better deal if you're planning to sign up for Xbox All Access. Once you subtract the price of the console you end up paying about $12.50 a month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate compared to its solo $15 monthly rate. If you have an older console though you may be able to get the Series X for as little as $300 with a trade-in. Read the Xbox Series S review. $300 at Best Buy

Microsoft Xbox Series X If you've been gaming at 4K on an Xbox One X you may want to shell out the bigger bucks and upgrade to this model. You'll be able to get a higher frame rate with the One S but that's at the expense of resolution. If you're used to playing in 4K 1440p might look soft to you. But that will depend on the size of your screen and your visual acuity. Xbox All Access isn't a terrific deal with the Xbox Series X. At $35 a month once you subtract the price of the console you're shaving only about 80 cents off putting the console on your credit card and subscribing separately to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. (If you don't have a credit card remember that in order to sign up for the plan you still have to pass a credit check with Microsoft's third-party financing company Citizens One. The latter is the only way to subscribe to All Access as well.)

It’s also one of my least favorite things to do. I was the type of kid that had a pile of laundry in a chair that would grow each week until my mother came in screaming for me to clean it up. It wasn’t until I had my own home and two kids that I realized how important organization was to keeping a clean house (and why my mom yelled at me about that laundry).



For help I would search through Pinterest and read blogs to get organization ideas but I found that while many of the “hacks” were appealing to the eye the functionality was just not practical as I had hoped.

Enter TikTok’s “organization hacks.” Not only were the videos oddly calming and satisfying but they were also incredibly useful. It was an endless fountain of ideas where I could easily swipe through just for fun or narrow down ideas and actually see what the “hacks” looked like in action.

With #OrganizingTikTok having over 1.1 billion views and #organizing and the various combinations rounding in on millions of views it is easy to say that people love to organize. From fridge containers to dream closets to shoe collections TikTok has it all.

Here are 10 of my favorite hacks on TikTok that are oh-so-satisfying.

Backpacking is my least favorite form of wilderness travel because the packs are never under 40kg. But for some routes there is no other solution. In these cases a backpack designed to carry a heavy load makes the experience as bearable as possible.

Best Expedition Backpacks: Heavy Haulers Tested

At ExplorersWeb we have a lot of experience with really heavy packs. And while we appreciate the many duffels sleds and other methods of hauling heavy loads sometimes you just need a good heavy hauling backpack. Below we jump into the top expedition-worthy backpacks we tested this year. If you skip down the page I explain the many uses for expedition backpacks.

Best For: Load-bearing superiority of an external frame mixed with a snug fit

Load-bearing capability (out of 5) : 5

: 5 Volume : 125 Litres (7600 cu in)

Even beside its mammoth brethren this backpack — the Norrona Recon 125L Synkroflex ($700) — dominates in size. It looks like it was designed for a race of giants. The Norse god Thor would have used it to carry a load of hammers to Valhalla.

It is also the only expedition backpack here with a full external frame. It’s not like the old-fashioned external frames though. Those packs lurched back and forth since the bag’s connection to the frame was looser. This pack has both the advantages of an internal frame (close-fitting snug) and the load-bearing superiority of an external frame. Of all the backpacks tested this bore the weight by far the best. Forty-five kilos felt surprisingly good. You weren’t just thinking “Well this one involves slightly less suffering than the others.” Rather “Hm. I could actually manage this for weeks.” Empty this Norrona pack is about two kilos heavier than any of the others — 4.7kg (over 10lbs). The frame is aluminum but it feels like wrought iron.

Its one disadvantage is that extra weight. Weight is not entirely linear in backpacking. There are certain weight thresholds which vary from person to person where Hard turns to Extremely Hard within just a kilo or so. For me 43kg (96lbs) feels an entire level harder than 42kg (93lbs) while the difference between 41kg (90lbs) and 42kg (93lbs) is almost negligible. So the extra weight of the Synkroflex pack itself may be enough to tip you for a couple of days anyway into the extremely burdensome category.

Apart from enough straps to keep even the most irregular load trussed and shipshape it has several unique features. The long side pockets zip off entirely and the detached pair can zip together into a sizeable day pack. Brass rings on the waist belt may attach to a pulk assuming that you’re traveling in winter with more supplies than either a pulk or a jumbo backpack can manage alone.

The top detaches as well. It is also one of the only packs with two lift loops. A crisscrossing of bungee cord on the top lid securely holds a hat a jacket something you want ultra-accessible. As with the other packs the frame adjusts to accommodate individual torso lengths. Still I might not want to be 158cm (5’2″) with this one-size-fits-all pack. The 125L Synkroflex was designed for the Scandinavian infantry and it does seem made with broad-shouldered strapping Norwegians in mind.

The other packs in this review are thoughtfully sometimes beautifully designed and do their job well. But strictly in terms of load carrying Norrona’s Synkroflex is in a class by itself.

Kelty has been making recreational backpacks since the early 1950s. They invented the external frame although almost all their packs including the Coyote 105 are now internal frames.

In pack review lingo the Coyote 105 ($200) wins the Best Budget Expedition Pack category. It’s light for a serious heavyweight pack at just 2.5kg (5.5lbs). At $200 it’s incredibly reasonable in this rarefied world of $600 and $700 specialty expedition packs. Some daypacks cost as much as the Coyote.

Unlike many of the others the Coyote 105L doesn’t have a dozen compression straps that turn a backpack into shapewear. But it has all the essentials tons of room and carries 45kg as well as the others. Beefy Velcro patches let you adjust the polyethylene and aluminum frame for a customized torso fit.

Its pockets and zippers are cleverly designed. The Coyote backpack features a long back pocket is actually two pockets. The smaller wing pockets on the side have pass-through capability so you can slip through skis or even a tripod.

Mesh pouches at the bottom can hold a water bladder or keep hiking poles from slipping down. But the light nylon mesh which works so well for daypacks may not be able to endure years of stabs from spruce branches and hiking pole tips scrapes on abrasive rocks and other expedition abuse. For such extreme use materials should all be sterner stuff.

Orange daisy chain loops running vertically down the back pocket let you strap items like a wet tent to the outside of the pack or hang small items from ‘biners.

The top of its line the Sitka Mountain Hauler 6200 ($595) carries weight exceptionally well thanks to its lightweight external aluminum frame. The frame is not as beefy or as prominent as the Norrona’s but the superior load-bearing ability of both these packs suggests that external frames handle the heaviest loads better than the best internal frames. This is because the load-bearing sections of the pack are attached directly to the frame. Internal frames support the weight more indirectly.

When this Sitka pack first arrived in its almost envelope-flat box I wondered: This is an expedition pack? But once you start unclipping and unzipping and loosening the pack expands — and expands — and expands.

As a hunting pack the Sitka’s Mountain Hauler offers a kind of meat shelf but it’s an adjustable load-bearing nylon floor within the main compartment itself and so does not add extra space.

The front of the pack features a huge open kangaroo pocket that is protected from the elements by the top lid. A double coating of polyurethane makes the nylon exterior starchier than other pack materials. Thus it may snag and puncture more easily but it is also waterproof enough to endure some rain without automatically needing a rain cover.

The Mountain Hauler 6200 is one of the only packs to feature double lift loops. Compression straps are not made for that sort of load-bearing. A Velcro strap on each side of the waist belt keeps bear spray or a utility knife within easy reach. When unzipped two lengthwise interior side zips add still more space to this very streamlined pack.

You can tell when a company spends a lot of time thinking about design and detail and this gigantic Kuiu Pro 7800 ($589) seems almost lovingly put together. Everything is supersized and everything is tough. Even the zipper pulls are superior. Some of the other packs (such as the Kelty) have small pouches on the waist belt to hold a phone or energy bar. The Kuiu has two big ones that easily accommodate even the biggest smartphones.

Some of the Pro 7800 backpack’s best features have the hunter in mind but the non-hunter also profits. The massive side pockets accommodate huge spotting scopes and just about anything else. Side zips allow access to the main compartment without having to remove a bow or firearm — or crampons tent poles or tripod — lashed to the flat back of the pack. The bottom pouches are the biggest and burliest of all the packs tested.

Although this Kuiu pack arrived as a unit the carbon frame and suspension fit other bags in Kuiu’s pro line as well. For lesser excursions you can buy a smaller bag and attach the frame and harness to it. It’s an affordable way to have several backpacks of various sizes. Like some other hunting packs in this review the Kuiu Pro 7800 can separate bag from the frame by undoing and then refastening a few clips. The bag is still attached but space between frame and pack can accommodate an extra 41 litres of food or gear.

Unlike the Stone Glacier EVO 6900 however there is not an actual nylon “shelf” on which the load sits just a couple of bottom straps. Side and bottom straps keep this extra load secure. Of course if you plan to use this inter-frame space try to fill it with heavy items like food. Likewise keep the heavier items in the pack bag as close to the frame as possible so that the pack does not pull you backward.

Given the obvious care that has gone into the design of this Kuiu backpack I was surprised that it carried 45kg a little less comfortably than the other models. There was pressure on the outside of the hips that the other packs did not give. But this pack has so many adjustment features — width of shoulder straps torso length even straps that shape the waist belt to individual body shapes — that it is possible that this slight discomfort came from my faulty adjustments. Nevertheless out of fairness I did have to rank it slightly lower than the other models for load-bearing.

In the mid-1990s when I was struggling to carry crushing weights in a big-volume pack I kept hearing about the brand favored by arctic guides. “We use Dana Designs packs” one of them told me as I staggered along so stooped over from the poor suspension of my own pack that after a week sciatic pains radiated down my legs.

The trek wasn’t a total waste. One of the clients lent me his spare hiking pole and I learned for the first time how useful it was. You could even balance the weight of the pack on the pole to give the shoulders a break in the absence of convenient boulders. And I learned about Dana Designs packs. By the time I went to buy one Dana Designs had been sold to K2 or Marmot I forget which came first. These big companies kept the heavyweight line for a while then phased it out. Probably a smart business decision. Really how many backpackers need a pack that carries 45kg?

Eventually founder Dana Gleason started a new company Mystery Ranch. At first he made packs mainly for the military firefighters etc. He still does. Those are the people who really need to carry weight and there are plenty of them and they all need packs. Voila business model. Not until 2015 did Mystery Ranch add a consumer line. I apologize for the history lesson in a gear review but eBay still does a humming business in those beloved 25-year-old Dana Designs Astralplanes and Terraplanes. A lot of old-timers write online paeans to their durability and performance.

Mystery Ranch’s current Terraplane ($400) looks very similar: the sleek close-fitting design the gigantic twin torpedo back pockets the extraordinarily comfortable waist belt. At 82 litres (5005 cu in) it is smaller than the other packs in this range but it still stored and bore the requisite 45kg better than almost all the other packs. Its big brother the T100 ($450) is essentially the same pack with a bigger bag.

Advanced features: the top lid converts into a small day pack comfortably supported by the actual shoulder straps of the main pack. A long side zipper allows access into the main compartment of the Mystery Ranch pack. Perhaps best of all the zipper to the lower sleeping bag compartment is straight rather than the usual half-moon shape thanks to some cleverly used extra material. This makes that compartment so much easier to zip shut when stuffed to the gills.

My only criticism is that the bottom of shoulder straps on both the Terraplane and the T100 span just 23cm (9 in) by far the narrowest of all the models. As a result those straps may press against your lower sides in a way that the others do not. It didn’t affect a 68kg (150 lb) mountain guide but I’m 80kg (176 lbs) hardly overweight for 185cm (6’1″) and it bothered me.

This quality pack features enormous side pockets access to the main compartment through both the top and full-length front zipper and the best overload shelf — an actual floor that cinches to the frame when not in use.

At first setting up the shelf seemed less intuitive than with the Kuiu’s but all these expedition packs have YouTube videos that show how to adjust them properly. After two tries prepping the shelf was no big deal even for someone unfamiliar with this feature. It held the excess load — in this case a 10kg bag of flour — comfortably and snugly.

As with some other packs the lightweight frame of the EVO 6900 which costs as much as the pack itself fits different bag sizes so you can have an inventory of packs for expeditions overnighters and long weekends but only one frame.

Even for an experienced hiker adjusting a pack properly using all the adjustments at your disposal is a bit of a puzzle. Stone Glacier makes it easier with their two-tone shoulder straps: The line from dark to light should rest right on your collarbone. The shoulder straps attach to the back of the pack with sturdy Velcro and adjust easily. You can even offset the straps slightly for a wider or narrower carry.

Some packs in this review look square when loaded; others are long and narrow. The Stone Glacier EVO 6900 is more cello-shaped. No shape seemed better or worse than others. As with virtually every pack these days from daypack to expedition pack the EVO 6900 ($684) is hydration-bladder compatible.

How to Choose An Expedition Pack

Packs in this category tend to be rare. It’s like 40-below sleeping bags: Not a lot of consumers buy them so few companies manufacture them. For those that do it’s often more of a statement: We make gear for serious people. As you look at different pack options consider these details about your travel load and the equipment you need:

Expedition Pack Applications

I’ve hauled heavy packs over long trips several times. For example I’ve hiked the Arctic for a month. At .9kg of food per day with a couple of emergency days that’s already 29kg. A big-volume pack itself typically weighs 3kg. There is no wood in the Arctic for campfires so you must carry fuel and a stove: another 3kg. Shotgun for protection from polar bears 4kg. Camera gear. Warm clothing. Tent sleeping bag. They add up quickly. There is no escape. You either shoulder that weight or you don’t do the trip.

Load Weight

In recreational backpacking the rule of thumb is to carry a maximum of one-third of your body weight. In expedition backpacking it’s between one-half and two-thirds.

External and Internal Frame Packs

My first experience with 45kg (100 lbs) was with an old-fashioned frame pack that bore the weight surprisingly well. But those frame packs all had one problem: The bag itself did not offer much storage space. You had to strap many items on the outside. Carrying it I always felt like a one-man band or a patent medicine seller.

A couple of years later I was delighted to discover a big-volume internal frame pack. Unfortunately its frame was not up to the load-bearing promised by its volume. After about 35kg it carried like a sack of potatoes. Somewhere between a pack that had support but no space and a pack that had space but no support there had to be a perfect solution.

The packs in this guide strike a great balance.

PFC-Free DWR

A handful of brands in the outdoor industry have developed non-PFC DWR options. Traditional DWR treatments are full of fluorocarbons which are resilient chemicals that enhance a product’s durability and overall life. However these fluorocarbons (aka perfluorocarbons or PFCs) are toxic and can’t biodegrade.

Last year the European Union even banned perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) a type of fluorocarbon and related compounds. Scientific research backs the legal move: The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer found that these negative composites are carcinogenic for humans and that they pollute air and drinking water. Another University of Oxford study linked fluorocarbons to infertility.

Sustainable Features

A handful of these expedition packs have components of sustainable design while others have none. For the longevity of the planet and human exploration it’s essential for brands worldwide to prioritize high-level product design that also pushes the needle forward on environmentally-friendly materials fabric treatments sourcing and manufacturing solutions that are less toxic for people and the earth.

A few sustainable design features in these packs include PFC-free DWR and recycled fibers. For instance the Norrona Recon 125L Synkroflex Pack utilizes Econyl yarn which is 100% regenerated nylon yarn created from a range of waste including fishing nets.

Hunting Backpacks

Researching packs for this article I discovered a whole category that I was previously unaware of: hunting backpacks. Hunters often tote big loads when they’re going for a week or two and have to carry their elk quarter back out again. They often go in the fall when the weather is cool and they need more clothing. Maybe they also want to bring in a big base camp tent.

Of the six packs reviewed three are hunting packs. Don’t let the occasional camo color deter you: They aren’t just for hunters. They are multipurpose expedition packs.

Meat Shelf

Several hunting companies make large-volume backpacks that are at least as sturdy and well-designed as anything for the strictly hiking set. And many of these packs have a highly useful feature not found on recreational backpacks: a meat or overload shelf.

What is a meat shelf? It is a sizeable space between the frame and the pack bag where you can put a secondary load. You create the meat shelf by semi-detaching the pack bag from the frame by undoing and redoing straps. Some models like the Stone Glacier EVO 6900 above have an actual nylon shelf on which the load sits. Others just compress the load tightly enough that it can’t slip out the bottom.

A meat shelf often adds an extra 41 litres (2500 cu in). The load carries well and it doesn’t have to be meat. A canvas base camp tent — which would fill even a giant bag — or extra food fits perfectly here.

Expedition Backpacks: Tips and Tricks



Expedition packs work best when hikers are well-trained to carry a heavy load and tactful with pulling on and off the pack. Below some expedition backpack advice that may serve you on an expedition.

Training

You need to train. Even that might not be enough. Once a first-time partner hiked his 45kg load around his suburban neighborhood every day. But when we got to the wilderness he didn’t have the leg strength to step over onto or down from obstacles in uneven terrain. These are essentially one-legged deep-knee bends with a huge weight on your back. He gave up after a day.

Mental Fortitude

On the other hand you don’t have to be an athlete to carry a big pack. So much of wilderness travel is strength between the ears. On one of our early trips to northern Ellesmere Island my wife Alexandra and I both carried giant loads. She weighs 53kg (117lbs) and her pack weighed 34kg (75lbs). Although I found her struggles to stand up amusing mine were equally comical. It’s just the nature of the beast. We carried our packs for about six hours a day. Such efforts aren’t fun but they are possible. You just have to find a place in your head where misery and non-misery are the same.

Avoid Injury

No getting around it carrying this weight is hard. It’s easy to injure yourself not only from falling or the strain on the knees but just putting the thing on. I never swing it onto my shoulder as one does with lesser loads. If possible I perch the pack on a rock or a slope of ground. Otherwise I put it on sitting down stagger to my knees then like a weightlifter doing a clean and jerk I get my feet under me and stand up. It looks awkward but it avoids hernias and back problems when 300km from help.

Upgrade Recommended

All the packs in this article have different features and manage big loads slightly differently but every one of them was superior to the expedition pack I’ve used in recent years an Arc’teryx 95-litre pack called the Bora 95 (out of production since 2014).

From past experience I thought that the Bora 95 did pretty well with heavy burdens. But when I loaded it with the same 45kg that I used to test these newer packs it felt horrible by comparison. Packs have come a long way in a short time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tb25leS8yMDIxL29jdC8zMS9wbGFubmluZy1hLWxvZnQtY29udmVyc2lvbi13aHktY29zdHMtYXJlLWdvaW5nLXRocm91Z2gtdGhlLXJvb2bSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbW9uZXkvMjAyMS9vY3QvMzEvcGxhbm5pbmctYS1sb2Z0LWNvbnZlcnNpb24td2h5LWNvc3RzLWFyZS1nb2luZy10aHJvdWdoLXRoZS1yb29m?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Planning a loft conversion? Why costs are going through the roof,"It is taking longer and getting more expensive to add value and space to your home. A combination of rising labour costs a post-lockdown rush to get work done and the spiralling price of supplies mean homeowners who want to have a loft conversion are now having to wait up to nine months before a builder arrives.

“Waiting lists are longer than ever – many smaller firms don’t have availability until next summer which emphasises the need to plan and book ahead” according to MyBuilder a site for finding tradespeople which says some builders estimate the cost will be 20% more than before the problems started.

How long will it take?

When lockdown ended there was a rush of people who wanted to get work done on their homes both here and overseas. This meant demand has rocketed for supplies that are imported – from timber to plastics and polymers paints and resins roofing products aluminium and steel.

Delays at ports have meant shipping costs have spiralled especially from China says Noble Francis economics director at the Construction Products Association. “The price of imported plywood in July 2021 was 82% higher than a year earlier whilst fabricated structural steel was 65% higher than a year ago” says Francis.

Meanwhile the supply of products from the UK such as cement and bricks has been hit by the shortage of HGV drivers. Added to this there is a shortage of labour post-Brexit. Since 2017 there has been a 50% drop in the number of construction staff from the EU he says.

Most small and medium-size contractors now have projects lined up for the next six to nine months says Francis.

Because of the supply problems loft conversions which would normally take between eight and 10 weeks to install now take between 12 and 16 weeks says Dale Chadwick a builder based in Devon.

How much will it cost?

There are four main types of loft conversion and the costs vary hugely depending on which you choose. The cheapest and least disruptive option is a “roof light conversion” essentially adding a skylight window laying a floor decoration and putting in a staircase. The cost tends to come in at between £15000 and £30000 depending on the size and the quality of the build.

The most common type is the “dormer loft conversion” an extension to the existing roof with vertical walls which add floor space and allow for windows. They are suitable for most homes with a sloping roof and typically cost between £30000 and £50000.

Owners of detached and semi-detached homes can opt for a “hip-to-gable” conversion where one of the sides of the roof is replaced with a vertical end wall increasing the amount of interior space.

A “mansard roof conversion” alters the appearance of a house the most significantly with sloping walls and a flat roof. These bigger projects can cost between £50000 and £60000.

With the recent rise in construction costs homeowners are more likely to pay the higher end of these ranges according to MyBuilder which supplied the figures. Prices can vary significantly however depending on the materials used and your location. London will typically be more expensive and bathroom installation or higher-quality finishes will cost more.

Huddersfield-based Jo Simon Construction completed two loft conversions in Oldham on identical houses a few doors apart but the bill for one was 50% more. “This was due to the client requesting a higher specification of finish such as fancy niches and storage in eaves our company completing the decorating (on the first job the client did his own) addition of a bathroom and decorating the entire staircase of the house which has four floors” says partner Trish Nuttall.

Do I need planning permission?

Most loft conversions do not need planning permission as they can be done under permitted development rights. To qualify they must create up to 40 cubic metres of extra space for terraced houses or 50 cubic metres on detached and semi-detached houses.

If you live in a listed building you will need listed building consent from the local planning authority. Those in a conservation area an area of outstanding natural beauty or a national park will usually need planning permission.

What everyone will need is building regulations approval so that the extension complies with the law in terms of fire safety access and floor strength and other factors. An inspector will come to examine the work at different stages and issue a completion certificate at the end.

Builders or architects can help in submitting the plans for the building regulations and ensuring that they get approval. “This is imperative – without it you will be unable to sell your house later and the work may be dangerous if approval has not been given” says Nuttall.

Do I need an architect?

It is possible to work with a builder and architect who cooperate or just a builder. “You can hire an architect who will prepare plans for a builder to work to or hire a specialist loft conversion company or experienced building firm which will be able to create the plans as well as carry them out” says MyBuilder.

The best starting point is through a personal recommendation says consumer group Which? and ensure you ask to see examples of previous work. It is best to get three quotes for any job it suggests.

Should I warn the neighbours?

Keeping the neighbours informed is a good idea as construction can be noisy and the builders will need a skip which could mean moving cars around on the road. In some cases especially if you live in a terraced or semi-detached house you will need a party wall agreement. This happens when work is happening near a wall that is directly between properties belonging to two different owners.

The process begins by giving a “party wall notice” to neighbours of the intended works. They can agree; refuse consent which prompts a dispute-resolution process; or require that additional works are done. The builder or architect should be able to advise on this.

Typically work on a loft conversion should take between six and 10 weeks but these times have been extended as a result of the problems with labour and supplies.

Beware of builders who present time lines that appear too good to be true. “Longer waits may mean consumers are drawn in by rogue traders offering unrealistic turnaround times and cheap quotes. Customers need to have patience as a good builder is a busy builder which means waiting times may be longer than usual” says Brian Berry chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders.

There is usually no need to move out during the work although there can be obvious disruption such as noise and dust. In some cases scaffolding is put up and the builders enter and leave the loft that way (until they have to build the stairs) causing less disturbance.

Be sure to tell your insurer about any alterations that change the value structure or security of your home as this may affect buildings and contents insurance. It has been estimated that loft extensions can add significantly to the value of a home but that needs to be balanced with the amount of money spent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmRla2hvLmNvbS9pbmRpYS1jYXItbmV3cy90b3AtMTAtY2Fycy10aGF0LW9mZmVyLXRoZS1iZXN0LWJvb3Qtc3BhY2UtdW5kZXItcnMtMTAtbGFraC0yODAzMy5odG3SAXNodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJkZWtoby5jb20vaW5kaWEtY2FyLW5ld3MvdG9wLTEwLWNhcnMtdGhhdC1vZmZlci10aGUtYmVzdC1ib290LXNwYWNlLXVuZGVyLXJzLTEwLWxha2gtMjgwMzMuaHRtP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Cars That Offer The Best Boot Space Under Rs 10 Lakh,"Published On Oct 30 2021 12:00 PM By Tarun for Kia Seltos 2019-2023

The oil and natural gas company company earned $1.57 per share or $1.58 if non-recurring items are removed. That beat Wall Street expectations by a penny according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

A year earlier it lost $680 million or 15 cents per share.

Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales.

Revenue was $73.79 billion also topping expectations.

Elsewhere in the sector Chevron Corp. reported similar results moving to a strong profit after posting a loss a year ago. The oil company's results also beat analysts' forecasts.

Exxon's oil-equivalent production rose 4% to 3.7 million barrels per day in the third quarter. Production volumes in the Permian Basin averaged about 500000 oil-equivalent barrels per day up approximately 30% from a year earlier.

Oil companies were under pressure during the pandemic to curtail drilling after demand plummeted because so many people were staying home. Prices fell and exploration and production budgets were slashed. That resulted in less oil and gas on the market and in storage which in turn raised prices. But things have started to turn around as people get vaccinated and return to offices and begin to travel.

The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline spiked 13 cents over the past two weeks to $3.44 per gallon. The price at the pump is $1.22 higher than a year ago. Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday the rise comes as the cost of crude oil surges.

The energy sector has far outpaced the broader market in 2021. The S&P 500's energy stocks are up more than 50% compared with a roughly 20% gain for the overall index.

Exxon based in Irving Texas said it's looking into investing in lower-carbon business ventures. Its low-carbon investments are expected to be approximately $15 billion from 2022 through 2027. But the company along with others in the sector have faced growing criticism on climate change.

On Thursday ExxonMobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said that his company ""does not spread disinformation regarding climate change″ as he and other oil company chiefs countered congressional allegations the industry concealed evidence about the dangers of it.

Woods was among top officials at four major oil companies testifying as congressional Democrats investigate what they describe as a decades-long industry-wide campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming.

CHEVRON CORP.

Chevron Corp. on Friday reported third-quarter net income of $6.11 billion after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.

The San Ramon Calif.-based oil company said it had profit of $3.19 per share. Earnings adjusted for non-recurring gains came to $2.96 per share.

Earnings were so strong that the driller's net-debt-to-capital ratio has fallen below its target of 20% to 25% a key threshold that could spur an increase in stock repurchases Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said.

The results exceeded Wall Street expectations but Chevron does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $2.21 per share.

The company posted revenue of $44.71 billion in the period also beating Wall Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $42.47 billion.

Chevron pumped the equivalent of 3.03 million barrels a day during the quarter an increase of 7% from a year earlier aided by the purchase of Noble Energy in October 2020.

PHILLIPS 66

Phillips 66 on Friday reported third-quarter net income of $402 million.

On a per-share basis the Houston-based company said it had profit of 91 cents. Earnings adjusted for non-recurring costs came to $3.18 per share.

The results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.95 per share.

The oil refiner posted revenue of $31.47 billion in the period.

Thanks to the recent increase in oil prices the Dhahran-based company reported on Sunday that its net income in the third quarter increased by 158 percent from a year ago to SR114 billion ($30.4 billion) compared to $11.8 billion a year ago with a jump in it sales by 80 percent to SR359 billion ($96 billion).

Aramco president and CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement: “Our exceptional third quarter performance was a result of increased economic activity in key markets and a rebound in energy demand as well as our unique low-cost position our financial discipline and our proven ability to reliably deliver essential energy and chemical products to our customers.

“Some headwinds still exist for the global economy partly due to supply chain bottlenecks but we are optimistic that energy demand will remain healthy for the foreseeable future” he added.

“Looking ahead we are maintaining our strategy to invest for the long term and we will build on our track record of low-cost and low-carbon intensity performance to advance our recently announced ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across our wholly-owned operated assets by 2050.”

Crude prices have been helped by production cuts made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies a group known as OPEC+ which meets later this week.

ExxonMobil (XOM) America’s largest oil company posted net income of $6.8 billion swinging to a profit after a $680 million loss a year ago. Oil prices got crushed in the early months of the pandemic when countries were still limiting travel and economic activity was at a standstill. But they’ve roared back since surging above $80 a barrel.

Revenue at Exxon soared 60% to $73.8 billion as average crude oil prices rose 72% from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of this year according the the US Energy Information Administration. Oil futures topped $85 a barrel for the first time in seven years earlier this week although prices have retreated slightly since then.

Chevron (CVX) America’s second-largest oil company reported an adjusted profit of $5.7 billion excluding special items its best quarterly result in eight years. The $6.7 billion in free cash flow it generated was a record for the company.

The adjusted profit was not only 34% above the forecasts of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv it was nearly 17 times greater than the $340 million it earned in the year ago period.

Shares of both stocks were up slightly in premarket trading Friday following the reports. Shares of Exxon are up 56% so far this year through Thursday’s close while Chevron shares are up 33%.

But as good as financial results are for the oil companies the industry finds itself under renewed attack for their role in causing climate change. The CEOs of both companies were under fire during testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna urged the CEOs of both companies to follow in the footsteps of their European rivals in planning to cut production to address the climate crisis.

“Are you embarrassed as an American company that your production is going up while European counterparts are going down?” Khanna asked Chevron CEO Michael Wirth.

Wirth responded by pointing out that demand for energy is going up around the world and declined to pledge to reduce oil production.

“With all due respect I’m very proud of our company and what we do” Wirth said.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods similarly declined to commit to reducing production of oil.

“We are committed to lowering our emissions” Woods said.",,,

Denny Hamlin’s bid to make the Championship 4 field by virtue of a clinching Martinsville Speedway victory instead of math boiled down to a final handful of laps and an untimely nudge from Alex Bowman in Sunday’s Xfinity 500.

Hamlin made the title field for a third consecutive year with a rocky 24th-place finish in the Cup Series Playoffs’ Round of 8 finale avoiding elimination by eight points. But Bowman’s role as the antagonist with a Lap 493 bump that cost him a win drew Hamlin’s ire — both with post-checkered flag contact and sharp words in all subsequent interviews.

“He’s just a hack. Just an absolute hack” said Hamlin who led 103 of the 501 laps. “He gets his ass kicked by his teammates every week. He’s (expletive) terrible. He’s just terrible. He sees one opportunity he takes it. Obviously he’s got the fast car of the week and he runs 10th. He didn’t want to race us there. We had a good clean race. I moved up as high as I could on the race track to give him all the room I could he still can’t drive.”

Christian Darrisaw got the first glimpse of a future as big as the oversized 4-year-old playing flag football for his church's youth program.

Nearly two decades before Darrisaw impressed in his first start as the Vikings' left tackle two weeks ago in Carolina he was gazing up at Washington's home field. From an early age he displayed the quiet confidence he's shown as a two-star recruit at Virginia Tech and a first-round NFL draft pick.

""I'd look at the kids while they were on the field and tell them to look up through the tree line and see the stadium and hold onto that"" said pastor and coach Jeff Wooten. ""Christian was that kid who says 'Oh I'm going to the league.'""

Darrisaw's path to the field was not as direct as crossing the parking lot.

But family and former coaches say the 6-foot-5 315-pound ""lion with a puppy heart"" was steeled for the core muscle injury that delayed his Vikings debut after he was chosen 23rd overall the fourth offensive tackle taken. It was just another obstacle in a journey of many for a tough quiet kid whose commitment was forged watching his favorite NFL teams Philadelphia and Washington on television.

""Watching like Michael Vick and DeSean Jackson and all those guys like man I want to do this one day"" said Darrisaw 22. ""It hit me as I kept going through my career like we can make something out of this. I have a chance really. As I got older the chances were getting better and better for me.""

Darrisaw the only child of Kim Cherry and Jerronney Darrisaw was mostly raised by his mother and grandmother in Maryland. His parents who never married lead a dedicated support system and travel to nearly every football game college and pro.

Darrisaw built his foundation during childhood days volunteering at fundraisers and playing youth sports in the City of Praise Family Church in Landover about 30 miles south of where he expects his biggest cheering section of the season Nov. 7 in Baltimore.

He was the tallest kid by 9 years old said Wooten who figured Darrisaw was about 5-6 when he towered over kids in flag football and as a first baseman and cleanup hitter in baseball. He would get pain in his knees and back leading to a doctor's visit where he was told that's essentially the cost of playing sports as a big kid.

""Kind of like growing pains in a sense"" Cherry said.

Darrisaw was a tall target for the Spirit of Faith Youth football team playing tight end before he made the move to full-time offensive tackle at Riverdale Baptist a private high school just outside the D.C. beltway. Former Warriors coach Dion Golatt the father of Darrisaw's best friend D.J. Golatt said he'd put Darrisaw in the backfield for handoffs too.

""Early mornings I was training with the skill guys"" Darrisaw said. ""That's what kind of got me my good feet.""

Darrisaw right towered over other kids in flag football at age 7.

With his footwork and long arms he blossomed into a three-year starter and team captain for Caesar Nettles the former Riverside Baptist coach who recalled Darrisaw impressing against a nearby school's top defender named Chase Young. Before Young was a star at Ohio State and the second overall pick in 2020 to Washington he was playing Darrisaw in scrimmages for DeMatha Catholic.

""I don't know what more [colleges] needed to see"" Nettles said.

Darrisaw was on the radar of top college programs according to Nettles but unofficial visits at Michigan State Maryland Rutgers and Penn State didn't net official offers. He was ranked a two-star recruit. Questions loomed about his college position and academic standing. But Virginia Tech was sold when then-Hokies receivers coach Holmon Wiggins noticed the lanky tackle while recruiting a different Riverdale Baptist player.

Soon after the Hokies offered Darrisaw a spot. But lingering academic questions led to a semester at Fork Union a military school for boys.

""Not necessarily going to college right away having to go to prep school and work through that situation"" Golatt said ""he just continued to put his head down work hard and listen.""

A meteoric rise

The confines of military school tested Darrisaw's love for football. For four months he shined his shoes and went without his phone. He worked with academic tutors and played football. Students were shut off from the outside world during the first week. There was limited laptop access only if you could make it through that week.

""You see people leave left and right"" Darrisaw said. ""Maybe I should just join them and go to a lower division school or something like that but I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to play at the highest level.""

His commitment was tested again. Colleges asked about reopening his recruitment after those four months of growth. His time at Fork Union went so well his mother sent coach John Shuman a handwritten thank you.

But Darrisaw stuck with Virginia Tech who promptly rewarded him by starting the true freshman in the 2018 season opener against Florida State. That caught both parents by surprise even his father who was in Tallahassee for the game. Mom's excitement might have been heard from Maryland.

""I see 77 run out and I'm screaming at home"" Cherry said. ""My phone was blowing up it was crazy.""

That's when his NFL dream crept toward reality. Darrisaw ascended in each of his three years as the Hokies left tackle drawing attention from NFL scouts after a strong sophomore campaign that he affirmed as a first-team All-ACC pick as a junior.

Darrisaw with Vikings owner Zygi Wilf the day after the team selected him No. 23 overall.

In two of his three years Darrisaw gutted through injury. Atop the list of most painful was the high ankle sprain suffered in his second game as a freshman. He missed only one game playing through the sprain that eventually required what's called a ""tightrope procedure."" The surgery uses sutures instead of screws to heal soft tissue in the ankle.

Darrisaw said he didn't tell his parents the extent of that ankle injury. Nor did he tell them he was playing through abdominal pain last year. After the season they decided to get it checked out which led to his first operation in January performed by core specialist Dr. William Meyers.

""Family didn't even know he just played through it"" Jerronney Darrisaw said. ""I would've never known he was injured until he said something about it.""

Seeking the summit

When he was younger Darrisaw had a ""Mt. Rushmore"" of offensive linemen. The longest-standing member of that group is Trent Williams whom Darrisaw has said he has wanted to emulate since watching the former Washington tackle crush defenders.

""The way he goes out there and dominates every play"" said Darrisaw who shares Williams' No. 71 in the pros. ""That's what NFL tackles are supposed to do. You see that like aggressiveness in his game style. It's no plays off for him.""

Joe Thomas Jason Peters and David Bakhtiari round out Darrisaw's current mountaintop.

He prides himself on being available which is why the start of his Vikings tenure was so difficult. Better days with the core injury were erased by frustrating setbacks in summer practices. He was limited to drawing plays on the whiteboard in meetings and walking laps around the practice field eventually undergoing a second surgery — also performed by Meyers — in Philadelphia on Aug. 12.

The Vikings thought he was healed when they drafted him and so did Darrisaw who didn't fully participate in a padded practice until Sept. 29. He's relieved to finally declare ""100%"" health after grueling days in the training room. His first NFL start against the Panthers proved as much. His attitude through the struggle told coaches more.

""There's been plenty of negative going on right?"" coordinator Klint Kubiak said. ""He gets drafted here first round comes here and he's been hurt the whole time. But all he's done is put the work in.""

And he's done so with the same quiet resolve. Quarterback Kirk Cousins said he didn't fully register the franchise left tackle's presence in Carolina until after the winning touchdown in overtime. Amid years of rebuilding efforts on the Vikings offensive line going unnoticed is desired.

""It's funny because the first person I saw after we scored was him"" Cousins said. ""I realized 'Oh yeah he's out here.' Like I hadn't even noticed him all day which in a way is a good thing right?

Airlines have often operated to/from Australia with uneconomic loads keeping vital travel lanes open.

Operating these flights ""under such challenging circumstances is a remarkable contribution by international airlines in supporting Australia and its people"" - BARA.

Foreign airlines accounted for 87.5% of the total passengers transported to/from Australia through the pandemic (Apr-2020 to Aug-2021)

There were over 8000 cargo/freight-only flights in the 17 months to Aug-2021. FedEx led the way followed by Kalitta Air Air China and Tasman Cargo Airlines.

Some 150000 seats were scheduled to/from Australia from early Nov-2021 - the first step up in capacity since the Australia-NZ quarantine-free travel period.

Foreign airlines have shouldered the burden of returning Australians



Of the airlines that stayed in the market foreign carriers transported by far the most passengers according to data from the Australian Government's Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE).

Between Apr-2020 and Aug-2021 (the latest month for which international arrivals data is available from BITRE) some 1.52 million passengers were transported in and out of Australia including 618401 inbound passengers and 902345 outbound.

Of the total foreign carriers transported 1.33 million passengers - or 87.5% of the total while Australia-based airlines carried 190589 passengers or 12.5% of the total.

The tally was bolstered for Australia and New Zealand-based carriers by the (short-lived) open border arrangement between Australia and Zealand in 2021.

Thanks to the arcane international aviation system the Australian airlines can't ""hub"" their services over a foreign point. They can only operate to and from individual destinations making long haul operations more complex - one of the many reasons that this pandemic shock should lead to changes in the 75-year-old international rules.

Air New Zealand transported 406812 passengers in the 17-month period between Apr-2020 and Aug-2021 including approximately 50000 passengers who travelled under the capped flights programme.

Qatar Airways transported just over 220000 passengers in the 17-month period between Apr-2020 and Aug-2021 according to BITRE including some 75223 Inbound and 144999 outbound passengers.

Singapore Airlines handled more than 131000 passengers in the 17-month period and Emirates transported over 91000 passengers.

China Southern Airlines and United Airlines handled 54631 and 49583 passengers respectively.

Capped flights made the task even more burdensome financially

The challenge for carriers that remained in the market was made sterner when based on the requirements of State governments the Australian Government brought in tight arrival caps for international passenger flights from 04-Jul-2020. This triggered complex and onerous operational and commercial restrictions on airlines prompting some to withdraw from the market.

But for those that remained over the next 485 days to 31-Oct-2021 international airlines operated 10000 capped commercial passenger flights into the major capital city airports serving over 300000 arriving passengers most of whom were returning Australians according to the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia (BARA) a membership body for airlines serving Australia. (International airlines operated 1200 passenger flights for 57000 arriving passengers from April-2020 to June 2020 prior to the capped flights regime).

Airlines have often operated to/from Australia with uneconomic loads keeping vital travel lanes open for returning Australians outbound nationals incoming and outgoing cargo and freight and the small number of Australians that had special exemptions to leave.

The average number of passengers on a flight - mostly widebodies with over 300 seat capacity - was just 30 which over the last two months has been driven down to 10 or less per flight.

""Throughout the pandemic international airlines operated capped passenger flights into the major capital city airports under the most challenging commercial and operating conditions. The numerous cuts to the per flight caps made by government unilaterally and often with little notice caused considerable stress and problems for Australians overseas and for international airlines"" said Barry Abrams Executive Director of BARA.

""International aircrews also complied with extensive infection control procedures and strict quarantine arrangements on layover between flights. Differing requirements across state jurisdictions added to the difficulties and costs faced by international airlines. Operating 10000 flights for 300000 passengers under such challenging circumstances is a remarkable contribution by international airlines in supporting Australia and its people"" he added.

A total of 19 airlines transported passengers in each of the 17 months between Apr-2020 and Aug-2021 and a further seven airlines operated non-passenger services (often passenger-to-cargo aircraft flights) in the period.

Cargo airlines have done the heavy lifting

A mix of freighter and cargo-only passenger services by airlines continued to ensure Australian trade channels remained open supporting the movement of essential medical supplies and Australian producer and exporter deliveries around the globe. A number of these flights qualified for financial assistance through the Federal Government's International Freight Assistance Mechanism (IFAM) which helped cover airline operating costs.

Airlines maintained overall air freight tonnage to about 80% pre-pandemic levels at some 77000 tonnes on average per month according to BARA. This air freight facilitated vital supplies of medical and personal protective equipment especially in the early days of the pandemic and the online purchasing boom as the pandemic continued.

There were some 8248 cargo/freight-only flights reported by BITRE in the 17 months between Apr-2020 and Aug-2021.

FedEx led the way with 2127 flights followed by Kalitta Air (1334) Air China (1314) and Tasman Cargo Airlines (1044).

Cargo flights to/from Australia: Apr-2020 to Aug-2021

A brighter outlook but system challenges remain

There are some 150000 seats scheduled to/from Australia from early Nov-2021 marking the first step up in capacity since the short-lived Australia-New Zealand quarantine-free travel period in Apr-Jul-2021.

As shown in the green line in the chart below this remains well below 2019 levels (yellow line) and it will take many months to recover to those quantities.

Total weekly international seats to/from Australia: 2019 to 2022F

Almost 50000 seats per week in total are currently scheduled into Sydney and Melbourne airports from early Nov-2021 - more than the reported 38-47000 Australians overseas seeking to return home.

""The situation for Australians overseas to return home will become clearer over the coming days but the scheduled seat capacity is more than sufficient. Subject to approval by government flights and seats are available to support the return of international students and economic visa holders and then international tourists as envisaged under the National Plan"" said BARA.

Australian outbound travellers from states that have reached the 80% vaccination double-dose threshold are also expected to take advantage of the easing of restrictions to travel abroad filling some of the outbound seats on offer.

Three days prior to arriving into Australia passengers require a negative COVID-19 test in their country of departure - a requirement that could dampen demand especially discretionary travel. In countries in such as the UK there is testing on arrival rather than pre-departure which provides greater certainty for passengers to be able to return home.

Now to encourage airlines back

Throughout the pandemic health concerns have - rightly - trumped the interests of airlines.

But now there is the prospect of further opening much more attention will need to be paid to ensuring that doors are sufficiently and intelligently opened so that airlines will be tempted to reintroduce capacity into the market.

As a remote island nation Australia's reliance on air transportation is much greater than it is for most. Getting back even to 2019 levels will not occur in 2022 and meanwhile the impact on the Australian economy will be keenly felt.

That will be the next major issue to face; but for now the direction is positive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hdi93b3JsZC1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC01OTA4NDQwONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Israeli woman jailed three times for refusing to join the army,"Israeli woman jailed three times for refusing to join the army

Installed on the surface of the water are 144 000 separate solar panels the equivalent of 100 football fields. The 45 MW of peak power the project can produce complements the existing dam operations which can generate an additional 36 MW and provide electricity across three provinces in eastern Thailand.

The solar panels can generate electricity throughout the day while the sun shines and the hydropower dam can operate at night. Both share the same existing grid transmission lines and transformers. It is the first of what could be many similar floating solar panel projects rolled out across Thailand as the country takes early steps to decarbonize its energy sector.

The emerging technology is showing promise and generating interest throughout Southeast Asia. In Singapore a similar solar panel scheme is operational on Tengeh Reservoir while plans are under way to rollout similar projects in Malaysia Indonesia Vietnam and the Philippines.

This project in Ubon Ratchathani Province helps with one of the biggest issues associated with solar power infrastructure development: the scarcity and cost of land. The surface of the dam is normally unused except for small-scale local fishing which can continue even after the installation of the panels.

“Overall floating PV [photovoltaics] is cheaper compared to a solar farm. We save the land costs and we save the land for Thailand” said Prasertsak Cherngchawano Deputy Governor of Power Plant Development and Renewable Energy at the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) the state body in charge of the project.

Prasertsak confirmed plans for another smaller floating solar project in northern Thailand. Following that he said he expected that the next national power plan would include an expedited strategy to roll out more renewable projects and reduce the environmental burden and economic uncertainty of fossil fuels.

Despite modest increases in renewables capacity fossil fuels still dominate Thailand’s energy production and overall carbon emissions. The energy sector is the greatest cause of domestic CO 2 emissions contributing about three-quarters of the country’s total.

For decades Thailand has relied on natural gas for energy. Coal plants make up about 20% of energy generation but their carbon footprint is huge. Prasertsak said that EGAT plans to shut down its lignite coal plants in northern Thailand in the near future once capacity from renewables can replace it.

However energy expert Suphakij Nuntavorakarn said Thailand’s enormous oversupply of electricity which has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic means that heavily polluting power plants need to be phased out as soon as possible and new fossil fuel infrastructure prevented from being built.

Actions to address adaptation to climate change will be a major discussion topic at COP26 in Glasgow. While Thailand is not required to submit a formal strategy to COP26 it should communicate a plan about local impacts challenges and areas where it needs help.

“At COP26 it is time for Thailand to ratchet up its commitment to adaptation by ensuring that its adaptation plans are locally led and reflect the needs and priorities of vulnerable groups communities and places” said SEI Senior Research Fellow Albert Salamanca. “Failing to do so will risk a repeat of the impacts and suffering encountered during the 2011 megaflooding.”

He added “In essence Thailand’s target and commitment should not only be restricted with reducing greenhouse emissions but more importantly ensuring that the global goal of adaptation is achieved for its vulnerable groups.”

Becoming a hub for the production of electric vehicles is also on the national agenda with an additional aim of having 15 million of them on the road in Thailand by 2035.

In Friday’s final stage the leading position of the team with students from Saxion University of Applied Sciences and the University of Twente was not in danger anymore.

Over the past few years Solar Team Twente has worked meticulously on the development of a number of components specifically built for the solar car Mark van Eijk writes in his press release. In doing so the student team worked closely together with various business partners. Precisely those components developed in-house turned out to be worth their weight in gold in Morocco.

More on previous Solar Challenges here

Thijs Alberts Electrical Engineer of Solar Team Twente: “This year we started using a new self-designed powertrain including the JASMINE motor controller. That secret weapon proved to be the key to success. “By working with components that can be precisely configured to the specific characteristics of a solar-powered car and the conditions of the race we were able to run an almost trouble-free race. This was a great test for the car as well as important gains for the further development of solar electric driving.”

Tough race

Although Solar Team Twente had no major problems during the race it was not an easy one said Thomas Jansink race leader. “The conditions in Morocco were tough and varied: in the Atlas Mountains Red Horizon as the car is called had to overcome gradients of more than 12 percent work its way through crowded villages cope with the bumps of rugged dirt roads and it was certainly exciting to drive the solar car through wadis filled with water. We stayed calm and level-headed and looked together at how best to go about it. That worked well.”

The new experience – never before has such a big race between solar cars been held on the African continent – required a lot of improvisation from the team. Colin van Laar team manager: “When it became clear in February that we would not be going to Australia this year it was quite a disappointment. We had all been looking forward to it and working towards it for a long time. It was great to see how we set ourselves up as a team to keep working on the car. Fortunately the opportunity came along to race in Morocco. We grabbed it with both hands and did everything we could to be well prepared at the start. The team spirit of that period has brought us a lot in the past few days. We’ve worked really hard together to make it a successful race.”

Solar Team Twente qualified fourth in a sprint race on Sunday 24 October for the race which started in the coastal city of Agadir. Belgium’s Agoria which is affiliated with the University of Leuven held the lead until the start of the third stage on Wednesday but then saw Solar Team Twente take over the lead steadily distancing themselves from the competition. In the last two stages from Merzouga via Zagora back to Agadir the leading position was no longer in danger. In the end Agoria which won the solar race in Australia two years ago took second place in the challenge. The Delft Technical University team ended in third place. The third Dutch team to participate was Top Dutch from Groningen.

Nice alternative for Australia

Traditionally the best solar cars in the world compete every two years in the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge in Australia. Because of COVID-19 that race could not take place this year. The Solar Challenge Morocco appeared to be a good alternative. Colin van Laar: “We are very grateful to the organization for holding this event which gave us the chance to test our solar car against the best teams in the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvbmFzYS1zaGFyZXMtZmlyc3QtZXZpZGVuY2Utb2YtcGxhbmV0LW91dHNpZGUtb3VyLWdhbGF4eS82MjkwNDExLmh0bWzSAWxodHRwczovL2xlYXJuaW5nZW5nbGlzaC52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmFzYS1zaGFyZXMtZmlyc3QtZXZpZGVuY2Utb2YtcGxhbmV0LW91dHNpZGUtb3VyLWdhbGF4eS82MjkwNDExLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA Shares First Evidence of Planet Outside Our Galaxy,"Astronomers say they have found evidence for the first time of a planet orbiting a star outside our Milky Way galaxy.

The evidence was observed by a telescope operated by the American space agency NASA. It is called the Chandra X-ray Observatory. NASA says the orbiting observatory is the world’s most powerful X-ray telescope.

NASA recently announced that the observatory might have discovered a new planet in the galaxy known as Messier 51 or M51. The galaxy is popularly known as the “Whirlpool” galaxy. The research recently appeared in the publication Nature Astronomy.

The possible planet is considered an exoplanet. These are planets that orbit a star outside of our own solar system.

NASA says that so far more than 4500 exoplanets have been discovered and are considered “confirmed.” Thousands of other “candidate” exoplanets have been detected but require additional study.

But all of these have been observed in the Milky Way galaxy. And NASA says almost all of them are “less than about 3000 light-years from Earth.” Scientists estimate that an exoplanet in the M51 galaxy would be much farther about 28 million light-years away.

Exoplanets are hard for telescopes to identify. This is because the bright light of the stars they orbit can hide them. The identification process involves searching for drops in the light levels of stars. Such drops could be caused by a planet passing in front of a star.

This method has been used in past observations by NASA telescopes to confirm the presence of planets crossing in front of stars. These movements -- of planets partly blocking light from stars -- are called “transits.”

NASA’s latest finding is based on a transit detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. But unlike other NASA telescopes which search for drops in observable light Chandra is designed to detect X-rays.

The observatory “searched for drops in the brightness of X-rays received from X-ray bright binaries” NASA said in a statement. These binaries are defined as bright systems that usually contain a neutron star or black hole pulling in gas from a closely orbiting star. A neutron star is the unimaginably dense result of a supergiant star that has collapsed on itself.

The researchers said the activity of binaries causes the material near the neutron star or black hole to become superheated and glow in X-rays. However the area producing the X-rays is small. It is so small that a planet passing in front of it could block most or all the X-rays they added.

This method could permit exoplanets “to be detected at much greater distances” than other light-searching systems that depend on optical telescopes the NASA statement said.

Rosanne Di Stefano is an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge Massachusetts. She said in a statement that the research team is seeking “to open up a whole new arena for finding other worlds by searching for planet candidates at X-ray wavelengths.”

Such methods could be used in the future to discover other new planets in distant galaxies Di Stefano added.

The researchers say more data will be needed to confirm the observation as an actual “extragalactic exoplanet.” They say one problem is that the planet candidate has a large orbit. This means it is not expected to pass in front of its binary partner for at least 70 years blocking any confirmation attempts anytime soon.

However one co-writer of the study said the team is very confident with its findings. “We know we are making an exciting and bold claim so we expect that other astronomers will look at it very carefully” said Julia Berndtsson of Princeton University in New Jersey. She added: “We think we have a strong argument and this process is how science works.”

NASA officials said it's their first view of the region and future flybys will offer a clearer look. (Image credit: NASA/SwRI/MSSS/Andrea Luck)

We finally know what the north pole of Jupiter's moon Europa looks like from a distance.

The distant view from NASA's Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter captures the previously unseen region of the icy moon which has water vapor apparently arising from plumes and which may have habitable conditions in its ocean.

The image was taken from nearly 50000 miles (80000 kilometers) away while Juno was performing its primary mission to examine Jupiter's atmosphere. The resolution is admittedly quite rough as individual pixels are rendered at roughly 31 to 37 miles (50 to 60 km) each. But you can see changes in the albedo or light reflectivity on an otherwise very bright moon.

The view will improve next year when the spacecraft zooms only a few hundred miles above that same region Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton said during a Thursday (Oct. 28) NASA press conference.

""This is a tantalizing example and a taste of what to come"" added Bolton who is director of the space science and engineering division of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). The Europa results were briefly mentioned during a larger discussion about 3D views of Jupiter's atmosphere and the deep roots of the persistent storm known as the Great Red Spot.

Europa is a popular destination that has been imaged by spacecraft many times. The first close-up views were from NASA's twin Pioneer and twin Voyager spacecraft in the 1970s revealing an icy surface scarred by cracks. Even more detail came during the Galileo mission which orbited Jupiter and its moons between 1995 and 2003.

Quite a few spacecraft have flown by Europa on their way to other destinations and the Hubble Space Telescope and other telescopes near or on Earth do turn their eyes on the moon from time to time. But what constrains these various views is they all have been on or near the ecliptic which is the plane upon which the solar system's sun planets and many of its moons orbit.

Juno by contrast has a more polar-orbiting path that has shed unique views on Jupiter already such as showing the extent and stability of its polar cyclones. The picture of Europa was created by citizen scientist Andrea Luck using information from the JunoCam camera.

The press conference did not discuss what science could be performed at Europa's poles but previous peer-reviewed research has discussed transient water vapor at the south pole or attempted geologic mapping while getting as close to the poles as possible.

Later in the decade at least two major missions are expected to launch to Europa. The European Space Agency's JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) will fly by Europa and several other icy worlds after launch in June 2022 while NASA's Europa Clipper will focus on the moon following launch in October 2024. Both missions will arrive and operate at Europa in the 2030s.

Sammis plant,"A coal-fired power plant in eastern Ohio that had been indirectly saved by the bill that bailed out the state's two nuclear power plants will close in 2028.

Energy Harbor a former subsidiary of Akron-based FirstEnergy sent a letter to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency this month telling the agency its plans to close the remaining three units of the W.H. Sammis plant near Stratton in eastern Ohio along the Ohio River.

The letter was obtained by the Ohio Chapter of the Sierra Club and provided to The Dispatch. The closing was first reported by Cleveland.com.

The other four units at the plant were previously retired.

In 2018 FirstEnergy Solutions the name of the company at the time said it would shut down the plant in 2022 but it reversed the decision a year later just as state lawmakers passed House Bill 6 the legislation that bailed out the state's two nuclear plants by adding a fee to the monthly electric bill that consumers pay.

The decision came the same week state legislators approved a bail out of FirstEnergy's two nuclear plants in Ohio.

The legislation didn't directly provide aid to the plant but Energy Harbor said at the time that the bailout would improve its finances enough that it could keep the Sammis plant open.

The legislature later repealed the fee.

Energy Harbor did not respond to a request for comment this week.

The Sammis plant is Energy Harbor's last coal-fired power plant in Ohio and the decision to close the plant reflects another move away from the use of coal in Ohio. Several companies in recent months and years have announced plans to shut down their remaining coal-fired power plants in the state.

With a closing date set for Sammis there are only three big coal-fired plants left in the state — Cardinal in Jefferson County James M. Gavin in Gallia County and the Kyger Creek pin Gallia County — that have yet to announce plans to fully close.

That should have been evident when his front yard was turned into a graveyard for NFL quarterbacks.

But Garrett really drove his Halloween love home on Sunday when he arrived at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland.

Garrett showed up dressed up as the Grim Reaper replete with a scythe and all.

The best part of Garrett's costume though was a cape adorned with the names of the 33 quarterbacks the Pro Bowl player has sacked.

The cape features some of the NFL’s biggest names like Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes. And even the more insignificant like Dwayne Haskins and Luke Falk. Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger made the cape. This isn’t the first time Garrett has poked at Roethlisberger. In 2018 the Browns spoofed “The Office” and Garrett dressed as Dwight Schrute shredded a photo of Roethliberger.

Another notable one is Trevor Siemian the current Saints and former Jets backup. Garrett was fined $42000 in 2019 for two penalties against Siemian including one that resulted in a season-ending injury.

One notable name missing? Steelers backup quarterback Mason Rudolph whom Garrett infamously smashed over the head with his helmet in 2019.

Garrett was not the only Browns player getting in on the Halloween fun. Wide receiver Odell Beckham showed up as ""Thriller"" Michael Jackson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M1Y2xldmVsYW5kLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnJvd25zL2Jyb3ducy1hbm5vdW5jZS1pbmFjdGl2ZS1wbGF5ZXJzLWFoZWFkLW9mLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWdhbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Browns announce inactive players ahead of Steelers game,"CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Browns are set to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers in a Halloween matchup Sunday afternoon but they'll do so without a few players.

The following players are inactive for Sunday's game:



WR Donovan Peoples-Jones

CB Denzel Ward

CB A.J. Green

S Richard LeCounte III

DE Takkarist McKinley

G Hjalte Froholdt

DT Tommy Togiai



On Friday the Browns announced that Ward Peoples-Jones and LeCounte would all be ruled out for Sunday’s game.

Ward left the Thursday Night Football game against the Denver Broncos with a hamstring injury and after MRIs were conducted was sidelined from practice for the entire week leading up to the Steelers game. Held out of practice again on Friday the team decided to rule him out. Cornerback Greedy Williams will start in Ward's place.

Peoples-Jones sustained a groin injury during pregame warmups against the Broncos missing the game and going on to be sidelined from practice the entire week.

LeCounte the Browns’ fifth-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft was ruled out after being held out of practice for disciplinary reasons. The team said that the discipline stemmed from LeCounte “violating team rules” but are opting to keep the specifics of the incident in-house.

Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. defensive end Jadeveon Clowney defensive tackle Malik Jackson and fullback Johnny Stanton were all questionable for Sunday but were cleared to play before kickoff.

Beckham has been dealing with a shoulder injury playing through it on Thursday but remaining limited in practice throughout the week. Clowney is dealing with an ankle groin and knee injury Jackson is dealing with an ankle injury and Johnny Stanton is dealing with a calf injury. Stanton was added to the injury report Friday after practice listed as limited.

Green and McKinley are dealing with groin injuries and were not cleared to play Sunday. McKinley was added on Thursday as limited and then did not practice Friday due to the injury.

Wide receiver Jarvis Landry will serve as the Game Captain.

For the Steelers the following players were listed as inactive:



QB Dwayne Haskins

LB Melvin Ingram III

CB Ahkello Witherspoon

LB Buddy Johnson

OL Zach Banner

TE Eric Ebron

Ebron was ruled out for Sunday’s game on Saturday as he deals with a hamstring injury. Linebacker Melvin Ingram III was listed as doubtful to play Sunday with a groin injury and on Saturday was downgraded to out.

Banner wide receiver Chase Claypool running back Anthony McFarland and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger were listed on the injury report throughout the week but all returned to full practice by Friday. Banner was ruled out before the game.

CLEVELAND Ohio (KDKA) -- Despite all obstacles the Pittsburgh Steelers managed to turn around the game and won 15-10 over the Browns.

The team was away this weekend but that did not stop Steelers fans from showing up to FirstEnergy Stadium to cheer them on.

After the fourth quarter wrapped up Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger approached the stands and gave a fan his gloves.

The former number 1 seeds of the Western Conference from last season Utah Jazz have handed a tough loss to the reigning champions Milwaukee Bucks. In that process Eric Paschall created a lifelong memory for himself. In crunch time he dropped a hammer dunk on the Greek Freak Giannis Antetokounmpo. This dunk solidified a strong lead for the Utah Jazz with around 7 minutes left in the fourth quarter.

It was unusual to see Giannis on the receiving end of such a hammer. Since fans are mostly used to seeing him on the delivering end of such dunks. As Utah Jazz won the game it was arguably this dunk that was the morale crusher for the Bucks. Fans could not believe that the reigning Finals MVP could get posterized like this. Here’s a look at the highlight dunk from the game.

What does this mean for Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks?

The Milwaukee Bucks went down 3-4 after losing three straight games. Simultaneously the Utah Jazz pushed their record up to a 5-1 after a strong start to the season. While the Milwaukee Bucks played without Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday in this game Jazz was in full strength. They saw an impressive offensive performance from Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley.

For the Bucks they need to recuperate and avoid this three-game streak from extending. Giannis was primarily responsible for running the team on the floor tonight. Hence for Coach Budenholzer this game might have been an experiment on letting Giannis run everything from the offensive to the defensive end.

Here's why it didn't happen.

Imagine General Motors owning Ford. It nearly happened until it didn’t. TheDetroitBureau.com looks at what nearly happened and why it didn’t.

William (“Billy”) Crapo Durant founder of General Motors. (Photo Credit: GM)

William Crapo Durant — Billy to his friends — became President of the Buick Motor Co. after its founder David Buick left the company along with $100000. All was going well at Buick. One night Durant leaves the office to have dinner with his daughter Margery. There he is called to the phone. It is Benjamin Briscoe Jr. president of the Maxwell-Briscoe Co.

The conversation was recalled by Durant in notes for a never published autobiography and later recounted by Buick historian Lawrence Gustin in his book “Billy Durant.”

“Hello Billy I have a most important matter to discuss with you and want you to take the first train to Chicago.”

Durant answered “What’s the big idea Ben?”

“Don’t ask me to explain; it’s the biggest thing in the country. There’s millions in it. Can you come?”

“Impossible too busy sorry” Durant said. “But I can see you here. Why don’t you take the 10 o’clock Grand Trunk arriving at 7 o’clock tomorrow morning? I will meet you at the station and we will have breakfast together.”

Briscoe agreed and boarded the train later that night.

A meeting begets a big idea

The next day the two meet with Briscoe telling Durant that a J.P. Morgan partner and Maxwell-Briscoe financier was toying with the idea of a large merger of automakers nearly two dozen. Durant had his doubts.

Henry Ford above was mired in the Selden patent case when Durant proposed buying his company.

The plan involved too many companies and would take too much to resolve any differences. Durant countered with another proposal one involving fewer automakers that would sell medium-priced cars in large numbers such as Ford Reo Buick and Maxwell-Briscoe.

Upon further discussion they contacted Ransom E. Olds who ran Reo and Henry Ford who agreed to meet with Briscoe and Durant at Durant’s suite in the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit.

Briscoe opened the meeting stating he wanted the group to formulate a consolidation plan the could be presented to J.P. Morgan. But Ford and Olds wanted cash for their companies at least $3 million each.

This proved to be a big hurdle. With the chances of success fading the final straw proved to be a short item in the New York Times stating that the first large consolidation of automakers was coming and would be named International Motor Co. and capitalized at $25 million.

Morgan withdrew its support. The big idea was dead.

Durant carries on

Morgan may not have liked the idea but Durant did.

Before long he contacted the Olds Motor Works in Lansing Michigan about consolidating Buick and Olds with both companies owned by a holding company to be named General Motors.

Olds had fallen on hard times after the departure of their founder Ransom Olds several years before and were anxious to consolidate. On Sept. 16 1908 General Motors was incorporated starting an acquisition spree that led Durant to acquire the Albert Champion Co. the Oakland Motor Car Co. and Cadillac Automobile Co. among dozens of others.

But one prize still eluded him: Ford Motor Co.

Durant tries again

In 1909 Durant approached Ford’s business manager James Couzens about General Motors’ interest in acquiring Ford Motor Co. Couzens said he would talk it over with Mr. Ford. At the time Ford was fighting George Selden a patent lawyer who was granted a patent for the automobile.

Selden formed the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers and began collecting a 0.75% royalty on all cars sold. But automakers had to get a license from the ALAM. Having been refused one by the ALAM Ford built cars anyway. Selden sued and the case dragged on for years. Ford was still battling Selden when Durant’s offer arrived. With victory uncertain and huge costs being incurred with the installation of the automobile industry’s first assembly line Ford couldn’t help but be swayed by the offer.

“I had reason to believe that if we were successful General Motors would not require any more motor car companies” Durant writes.

At the time of Durant’s offer Henry Ford had just introduced the first moving assembly line for cars. (Photo Credit: Ford Motor Co.)

Ford agreed to sell his company to General Motors for $8 million. His terms: $2 million in cash $2 million in stock and the remaining $4 million paid during the next three years at 5% interest. But Durant’s acquisition fee left GM short on cash. Durant turned to the National City Bank of New York to ask for a $2 million loan even as GM’s board of directors gives Durant the authority to buy Ford on Oct. 26 1909. But the bank was unwilling to take a risk on the fledgling industry let alone Durant’s new company.

The answer was no.

The fallout

Ultimately Ford would prove victorious over Selden upon appeal and the assembly line proved a wise innovation. By the 1920s Ford would control half the U.S. automobile market with a single vehicle the Model T. Ultimately through a combination of factors GM would surpass Ford become the top seller of automobiles in the U.S. for decades.

However one wonders what might have been had things turned out differently in 1909.

While those same bankers later admitted they made a mistake Durant harbored no regrets. “I never would have built up that business the way Ford did” he recalled. “The Ford business would never have been what it is without Henry Ford who has done more for America than any other man — more for the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsb2Ryb21lLmNvbS9mdWxsLWRvY3VtZW50YXJ5LWZvcmQtYW5kLXRoZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1kcmVhbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Full Documentary: Ford And The American Dream,"Ford And The American Dream is a full length documentary film about the history of one of America’s most famous automakers.

The film moves through Ford history starting before the Model T and highlights many of the company’s greatest hits like the Model T the ’32 Ford the ’38 and ’39 Fords the Ford-build Jeeps the ’49 Ford and the Thunderbirds starting in 1955.

Lincolns get a number of honorable mentions as do the Mercurys. As the film moves into the 1960s the Mustang takes centerstage thanks to the wild popularity of the car that sold millions of units and founded the “pony car” craze.

The Ford GT40s and their remarkable wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans finish up the coverage of the 1960s. Interestingly there’s no mention of the Ford Bronco series perhaps a little surprising given the popularity of the model and its influence on SUVs going forwards.

Over the course of the almost hour-long film you’ll see a vast array of footage from the Ford vault including new car releases racing and factory footage of the cars being made. It’s not a deep dive into Ford history and it doesn’t include any of the mistakes or controversies in Ford history but it does give a good quick foundation on major Ford models from the early-to-mid 20th century.

Investors are finally starting to believe in Ford Motor Company's (F -1.15%) turnaround plan. On Wednesday afternoon the auto giant reported strong results for the third quarter of 2021 raised its full-year earnings guidance and reinstated its dividend. Investors applauded sending Ford stock up 10% in the final two days of the week.

The latest rally has lifted Ford stock to levels not seen since 2014. Nevertheless the shares could continue to rise as Ford capitalizes on its recent restructuring moves and an improving supply of semiconductors over the next couple of years.

A massive earnings beat

The global chip shortage crushed Ford's production in the second quarter. Chip availability began to improve in the third quarter driving a 32% sequential increase in vehicle wholesales and a 33% sequential increase in revenue.

Wholesale volume for Ford's consolidated operations still declined 14% year over year to just over 1 billion units. However automotive revenue slipped just 4% as the iconic automaker was largely able to offset lower volume with higher prices.

The strong pricing environment partially offset the negative impact of lower volume and higher costs relative to Q3 2020. As a result Ford reported an adjusted operating profit of $3 billion. The company generated essentially all of its profit from its North American operations and its financing business. Ford's overseas divisions collectively reported a tiny operating profit of $36 million. Still this marks a big improvement compared to the substantial losses Ford has often reported outside North America in recent years.

Thanks to its solid operating profit Ford posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.51 last quarter: down from $0.65 a year earlier but far ahead of the analyst consensus of $0.27. Ford also generated stunning adjusted free cash flow of $7.7 billion in the quarter reversing a $5.5 billion outflow in the first half of 2021.

Ford raises its guidance

With production profitability and cash flow rebounding from the severe disruptions experienced earlier this year Ford increased its full-year guidance on Wednesday. The automaker now expects to report full-year adjusted operating income between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion: up from a prior guidance range of $9 billion to $10 billion.

Management also reaffirmed the company's prior target of generating between $4 billion and $5 billion of adjusted free cash flow this year. Based on this outlook and the company's strong balance sheet Ford will restart its dividend with a quarterly payout of $0.10 per share.

Ford hasn't provided firm guidance for 2022 but management currently expects wholesales to increase 10% year over year as semiconductor supply gradually improves. That could power further increases in operating income EPS and free cash flow. Moreover even a 10% increase in production wouldn't come close to meeting demand paving the way for further growth in 2023.

Finally moving in the right direction

Considering the negative impact of the chip shortage Ford's third-quarter results were quite solid. To be sure the company hasn't finished turning around its overseas operations but it has made substantial progress as shown by its ability to reduce its losses despite production constraints.

As the chip shortage eases and production recovers Ford should start generating meaningful profits outside of North America. Meanwhile pent-up demand and key new products like the Bronco and Bronco Sport will drive revenue and earnings growth in North America over the next couple of years.

This momentum puts Ford in great position to exceed its long-term operating margin target of 8% by 2023 translating to annual EPS of more than $2. The company also has valuable investments in electric truck maker Rivian and autonomous driving start-up Argo AI that it could monetize in the years ahead. While Ford stock has more than doubled over the past 12 months these factors suggest that it still has plenty of upside.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS1mb3JkLW11c3RhbmctbWFjaC1lLWd0LXJlY2VpdmVzLWRvdWctZGVtdXJvcy10aHVtYnMtdXAtMTczMDUzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E GT Receives Doug DeMuro's Thumbs Up,"The GT is the Ford Mustang Mach-E for you if you want both space for the family and more than adequate performance. According to Doug DeMuro’s infamous Dougscore this variant is the perfect contender for the best-selling Tesla Model Y Performance thanks to overall scores of 68 points.

There is however a problem with the range-topping version of the Mustang Mach-E. Not only does it start from $59995 excluding taxes and options but if you specify the Performance Edition  the price goes up by $5000.That’s a tremendous grand total for a vehicle in this particular segment which is why the Ford Motor Company was inspired to drop the Blue Oval badging in favor of the pony we all know and love from the ‘Stang.Speaking of which the S650 generation that’s due to arrive in 2022 as a 2023 model may receive hybrid versions of the EcoBoost four-cylinder turbo and Coyote lump. As ever Ford will make the new pony at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant where just around 2420 employees work today.Turning our attention back to the Mustang Mach-E GT the white-painted example reviewed by Doug carries a total retail price of $63885. That kind of money is plenty enough for a brand-new Dodge Challenger Hellcat or a 2022 Chevy Corvette Stingray in their most no-frills specs.DeMuro also makes a case for pretty decent value in terms of pricing and worse value overall compared to a Model Y Performance. The closest rival starts at $61990 which is more than a Mustang Mach-E GT because you get better acceleration (3.5 vs. 3.8 seconds) and better range (303 vs. 270 miles). The Performance Edition is listed by the configurator with 3.5 seconds to 60 miles per hour (97 kph) but the range dives to 260 miles.The Ford Mustang Mach-E also wins the styling battle according to DeMuro who is most impressed by the driving characteristics. “This car is a better drive period” highlighted the reviewer. “I would rather give up three-tenths of a second and get what this car offers which is great handling.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3JhbmtpbmctYmVzdC1hbWVyaWNhbi02LWN5bGlkZXItY2Fycy1ldmVyLW1hZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ranking The Best American 6-Cylider Cars Ever Made,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3JhbmtpbmctYmVzdC1hbWVyaWNhbi02LWN5bGlkZXItY2Fycy1ldmVyLW1hZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

So let’s take a look at the oldest golfer who went to the length and showed crazy longevity on PGA Tours.

Sam Snead tops the unique list of PGA Tour legends

Sam Snead was undoubtedly one of the greatest golfers in the world. He ruled the golfing world for almost three decades and won PGA tours on 82 ocassions tied for the highest with Tiger Woods. He won his first title in 1936 and his last in 1965. However the Slammin’ Sammy continued to remain an active golfer until the end of the century hitting the honorary starting tee shot at the Masters from 1984 to 2002.

At the Manufacturers Hanover Westchester Classic in 1979 Snead was a little over 67 years. He finished 74 and became the oldest golfer to make the cut and his record remains till date. Meanwhile Jack Renner went on to win the tournament. In addition Snead was also the oldest winner on the PGA Tour in 1965 but was soon overtaken.

Who are the top-10 on the list?

The list is an interesting one. Barring Sam Snead all the other golfers featured on the list are for their 2022 participation. Moreover the late legend has a whopping 16 years over the second on the listing. Next name on the coveted list is Phil Mickelson who was 51-years-old when he T-36 in the 2022 Fortinet Championship.

Yet that’s exactly what happened when Fox Weather launched on Monday last week to much fanfare from its owners but to serious trepidation from people concerned that the channel could match the infamous climate change scepticism of its sister channel Fox News.

Hosts on Fox News have spent years rubbishing or undermining the idea of human-caused climate breakdown and the fact that two Fox News-linked executives were behind the Fox Weather launch meant the worries might be well-founded.

In its first few days Fox Weather is yet to play host to guests who have suggested that climate change is a hoax or not serious. But that’s not to say the nascent TV channel has been championing environmental reform.

“Fox Weather Doesn’t Deny Climate Change. They Just Ignore It” ran a headline in the New Republic on Wednesday.

Over several hours spent watching Fox Weather the Guardian heard plenty of detail – much of it genuinely informative – about how tornadoes form and how storms can be observed in 3D maps. There were public advisories too: don’t drive around in floods viewers were told while people in the path of a storm were advised to shelter in a bathroom or hallway.

But as the meteorologists from their cream-and-red set based in New York City giddily dissected the unusual number of storms for this time of year there was little mention of the climate crisis even as world leaders prepare to gather at Cop26 in Glasgow this week to try to tackle the problem.

To be fair a side-by-side analysis of the midday output of the Weather Channel seen as the gold standard of live meteorological news yielded similar results. Neither channel is devoted to the broader topic of weather and climate exactly; instead they play out more as weather dramas where breaking events are covered breathlessly in the moment with little time for reflection.

The reason for the concerns about Fox Weather though are clear. In 2020 Fox News’ most-watched host Tucker Carlson rubbished the idea that forest fires on the west coast were a result of climate crisis – serious climate scientists however agree that the fires are very much linked to the breakdown – and suggested environmental hazards were a liberal conspiracy.

Carlson’s colleague Laura Ingraham has insisted contrary to experts’ findings that the planet is in a “natural” cycle of warming and suggested that environmental activists like Greta Thunberg had been “brainwashed” while Sean Hannity said the left’s “obsession” with the climate was a “political tool”.

In the first half of 2019 to take one sample Public Citizen found that Fox News devoted 247 segments to the climate crisis. Of those “212 (86%) were dismissive of the climate crisis cast warming and its consequences in doubt or employed fearmongering when discussing climate solutions” Public Citizen said.

There have been no overt examples of denialism on Fox Weather and the channel has been at pains to state its climate change bona fides. A Fox News Media spokeswoman pointed to statements by executives and its meteorologists addressing the issue of climate change.

“If you’re asking about climate change climate change is part of our lives. It’s how we live. It’s not going to be ignored” Sharri Berg formerly the executive vice-president of news operations for the Fox News channel and currently one of the people in charge of the Fox Weather launch told Variety on October 21.

“We will be reporting facts” Berg said.

There have however been a number of missed opportunities to mention the climate crisis particularly in the articles published to Fox Weather’s website.

A piece “7 facts about heat waves” notes that “heat waves occur more often than they used to” but makes no mention of the changing climate. Another article says that Louisiana “has lost roughly 2000 square miles of wetlands” over the last 90 years but does not mention the climate crisis responsible for stronger storms and rising seas.

A piece about fall foliage being delayed in Tennessee because of warmer temperatures makes no mention of rising temperatures globally while an article about a shortage of roses notes that the weather in South America where many roses are grown had been “unseasonably cold” and mentions that “Parts of Columbia [sic] and Ecuador have received upwards of 400 percent of above-average rainfall”. But the climate crisis is not mentioned.

On Friday a piece about coastal flooding did cite the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as saying sea-level rise caused by climate change was responsible for flooding.

It would appear that in stories where other news outlets would almost certainly mention the planet’s changing climate Fox Weather pieces can shy away from the topic.

Despite Berg assigning a reporter to cover the impending Cop26 climate crisis conference in Glasgow as of Thursday there was not a single mention of Cop26 on its website.

It may be too soon less than a week after its launch to draw a full assessment of the channel’s overarching direction on climate.

But so far while Fox Weather isn’t denying the climate crisis it isn’t exploring it either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdmlkZW9zL21lZGlhLzIwMjEvMTAvMzEvanVsaWUtcm9naW5za3ktcnVwZXJ0LW11cmRvY2gtZm94LW5ld3MtcnMtdnB4LmNubtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Fox News contributor: Murdoch is probably concerned Trump will get reelected,"1.

In a statement Saturday Roblox said: ""We believe we have identified an underlying internal cause of the outage with no evidence of an external intrusion. We are in the process of performing the necessary engineering and maintenance work to get Roblox back up and running as soon as possible.''

Roblox said on Friday that the outage was ""not related to any specific experiences or partnerships on the platform.’’ This was apparently meant to quash rumors that the trouble was caused by a free burrito giveaway at a digital Chipotle on the Roblox platform.

Speaking on his show on Saturday the news anchor turned his attention to controversial Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson who is set to release a three-part documentary Patriot Purge on 1 November.

According to Insider the special – to be released on the Fox Nation streaming service – will suggest that the Capitol riot was a “false flag” to persecute conservatives.

In a clip shared to Twitter Acosta responded to news of the Tucker Carlson Original show by saying that Americans have “already seen” what the presenter’s “brand of hate-filled rhetoric can do to America” – citing examples such as the demonstrations by white nationalists in Charlottesville in 2017 and the 2019 Walmart shooting in El Paso Texas.

“The reason why federal investigators and millions of Americans are terrified by right-wing violence in this country is because it keeps happening and Tucker Carlson is inciting more of it” he said.

He added: “Tucker is calling his propaganda flick the Patriot Purge? It’s nothing more than Proud Boy porn and the worst part is that a major corporation in America – Fox – is bankrolling it.

“Fox is insisting Tucker’s manifesto will only be seen on its streaming service Fox Nation. Please no matter how you slice it the Murdoch family which controls Fox is cashing in as American democracy is being set ablaze.”

The broadcaster went on to add that people compare the Murdochs to the HBO drama Succession but said it was actually “more like secession”.

“The Murdochs and Tucker Carlson – their primetime pyromaniac – appear to be hell-bent on driving this country into a civil war” he continued.

Twitter users have since praised Acosta for his remarks and “always [telling] it like it is”:

Carlson wasn’t the only person the CNN anchor chose to criticise on his Saturday night show as Acosta also ridiculed Texas senator Ted Cruz.

“I’m starting to think the problem with [him] is not that he went to Cancun it’s that he came back” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL29jdC8zMC90dWNrZXItY2FybHNvbi1jb25kZW1uZWQtY2FwaXRvbC1hdHRhY2stbGl6LWNoZW5ledIBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL29jdC8zMC90dWNrZXItY2FybHNvbi1jb25kZW1uZWQtY2FwaXRvbC1hdHRhY2stbGl6LWNoZW5leQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tucker Carlson condemned over ‘false flag’ claim about deadly Capitol attack,"The conservative Republican Liz Cheney and the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League led condemnation of Fox News and Tucker Carlson after the primetime host announced a series about the supposed “true story” of the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January.

They denounced Carlson for spreading dangerous conspiracy theories in the latest scandal to engulf a man whose popularity belies his record of racist and untrue statements on issues from immigration to racial justice.

“Fox News is giving Tucker Carlson a platform to spread the same type of lies that provoked violence on 6 January” tweeted Cheney a Wyoming representative on the dwindling anti-Trump wing of the Republican party.

Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL wrote to Lachlan Murdoch chief executive of Fox Corporation to demand the series be shelved.

“Clearly Carlson has the right to make outrageous claims” Greenblatt wrote. “But freedom of speech is not freedom of reach. You have no obligation to validate his views with airtime on your platform and I would argue a moral responsibility not to do so.”

Greenblatt has previously called for Carlson to be fired over his advocacy of the racist replacement theory which says Democrats encourage immigration to keep Republicans out of power. Lachlan Murdoch rejected that request.

In the trailer for Carlson’s series Patriot Purge a pundit says: “False flags have happened in this country one of which may have been 6 January.”

Among conspiracy theorists “false flag” events are said to be staged by the government to pursue nefarious ends. Some claim the 9/11 terrorist attacks were false flags. The InfoWars host Alex Jones a Trump ally and supporter has landed in legal and financial jeopardy after claiming the Sandy Hook school shooting of 2012 in which 20 young children and six adults were killed was a false flag attack.

Carlson has called the 6 January riot “a political protest that got out of hand”. He has also claimed it was organised by the FBI.

Cheney said: “As Fox News knows the election wasn’t stolen and 6 January was not a ‘false flag’ operation.”

Five people including a Trump supporter shot by law enforcement and a police officer died around the Capitol attack. The riot followed a “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House at which Trump told supporters to march on Congress and “fight like hell” to overturn the election.

Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection. Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to send him to the Senate for trial but only seven Republican senators joined Democrats in finding Trump guilty and he was not convicted. He is free to run for office again fundraising strongly and dominating polls regarding possible candidates for 2024.

Trump has stuck to his lie that the election was stolen a claim rejected by his own attorney general Republican officials in key states and a succession of judges. The Republican party has swung behind Trump also seeking to play down the events of 6 January a day which has led to more than 600 arrests.

Another outlet owned by Rupert Murdoch the Wall Street Journal was condemned this week for printing a letter in which Trump repeated his election lies.

In another tweet Cheney asked Carlson: “Are you still falsely contending the voting machines were corrupted and the election was stolen?” She included the Twitter handles of Rupert Murdoch Fox News’s chief executive Suzanne Scott its president and executive editor Jay Wallace and the former House speaker Paul Ryan now a member of the Fox board. None commented.

Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.

On Thursday another Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera told the New York Times Carlson was “wonderful” and “provocative” but said things that were “inflammatory and outrageous and uncorroborated”. On Twitter Rivera called the “false flag” claim in Carlson’s trailer “bullshit”.

Carlson’s series will premiere on the Fox Nation streaming service on Monday. Scored to martial drums its trailer says it will tell the “the true story behind 1/6 … the war on terror 2.0 and the plot against the people”.

“The domestic war on terror is here and it’s coming after half of the country” a pundit says over shots of helicopters near the Capitol and the title Patriot Purge.

Carlson says: “The helicopters have left Afghanistan and now they’ve landed here at home.”

On Thursday Carlson claimed: “What we found … bore no resemblance whatsoever to the story that you have heard repeatedly from Liz Cheney and Nancy Pelosi as well as their many obedient mouthpieces in the media. They were lying.”

In his trailer another pundit says: “The left is hunting the right sticking them in Guantánamo Bay for American citizens leaving them to rot.”

The trailer also splices footage of Trump speaking with a shot of Osama bin Laden while scenes outside the Capitol on 6 January are scored to the Battle Hymn of the Republic. The trailer culminates with the refrain of that civil war song: “The truth is marching on.”

Yet that’s exactly what happened when Fox Weather launched on Monday last week to much fanfare from its owners but to serious trepidation from people concerned that the channel could match the infamous climate change scepticism of its sister channel Fox News.

Hosts on Fox News have spent years rubbishing or undermining the idea of human-caused climate breakdown and the fact that two Fox News-linked executives were behind the Fox Weather launch meant the worries might be well-founded.

In its first few days Fox Weather is yet to play host to guests who have suggested that climate change is a hoax or not serious. But that’s not to say the nascent TV channel has been championing environmental reform.

“Fox Weather Doesn’t Deny Climate Change. They Just Ignore It” ran a headline in the New Republic on Wednesday.

Over several hours spent watching Fox Weather the Guardian heard plenty of detail – much of it genuinely informative – about how tornadoes form and how storms can be observed in 3D maps. There were public advisories too: don’t drive around in floods viewers were told while people in the path of a storm were advised to shelter in a bathroom or hallway.

But as the meteorologists from their cream-and-red set based in New York City giddily dissected the unusual number of storms for this time of year there was little mention of the climate crisis even as world leaders prepare to gather at Cop26 in Glasgow this week to try to tackle the problem.

To be fair a side-by-side analysis of the midday output of the Weather Channel seen as the gold standard of live meteorological news yielded similar results. Neither channel is devoted to the broader topic of weather and climate exactly; instead they play out more as weather dramas where breaking events are covered breathlessly in the moment with little time for reflection.

The reason for the concerns about Fox Weather though are clear. In 2020 Fox News’ most-watched host Tucker Carlson rubbished the idea that forest fires on the west coast were a result of climate crisis – serious climate scientists however agree that the fires are very much linked to the breakdown – and suggested environmental hazards were a liberal conspiracy.

Carlson’s colleague Laura Ingraham has insisted contrary to experts’ findings that the planet is in a “natural” cycle of warming and suggested that environmental activists like Greta Thunberg had been “brainwashed” while Sean Hannity said the left’s “obsession” with the climate was a “political tool”.

In the first half of 2019 to take one sample Public Citizen found that Fox News devoted 247 segments to the climate crisis. Of those “212 (86%) were dismissive of the climate crisis cast warming and its consequences in doubt or employed fearmongering when discussing climate solutions” Public Citizen said.

There have been no overt examples of denialism on Fox Weather and the channel has been at pains to state its climate change bona fides. A Fox News Media spokeswoman pointed to statements by executives and its meteorologists addressing the issue of climate change.

“If you’re asking about climate change climate change is part of our lives. It’s how we live. It’s not going to be ignored” Sharri Berg formerly the executive vice-president of news operations for the Fox News channel and currently one of the people in charge of the Fox Weather launch told Variety on October 21.

“We will be reporting facts” Berg said.

There have however been a number of missed opportunities to mention the climate crisis particularly in the articles published to Fox Weather’s website.

A piece “7 facts about heat waves” notes that “heat waves occur more often than they used to” but makes no mention of the changing climate. Another article says that Louisiana “has lost roughly 2000 square miles of wetlands” over the last 90 years but does not mention the climate crisis responsible for stronger storms and rising seas.

A piece about fall foliage being delayed in Tennessee because of warmer temperatures makes no mention of rising temperatures globally while an article about a shortage of roses notes that the weather in South America where many roses are grown had been “unseasonably cold” and mentions that “Parts of Columbia [sic] and Ecuador have received upwards of 400 percent of above-average rainfall”. But the climate crisis is not mentioned.

On Friday a piece about coastal flooding did cite the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as saying sea-level rise caused by climate change was responsible for flooding.

It would appear that in stories where other news outlets would almost certainly mention the planet’s changing climate Fox Weather pieces can shy away from the topic.

Despite Berg assigning a reporter to cover the impending Cop26 climate crisis conference in Glasgow as of Thursday there was not a single mention of Cop26 on its website.

It may be too soon less than a week after its launch to draw a full assessment of the channel’s overarching direction on climate.

But so far while Fox Weather isn’t denying the climate crisis it isn’t exploring it either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdmlkZW9zL21lZGlhLzIwMjEvMTAvMzEvanVsaWUtcm9naW5za3ktcnVwZXJ0LW11cmRvY2gtZm94LW5ld3MtcnMtdnB4LmNubtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Fox News contributor: Murdoch is probably concerned Trump will get reelected,"1.

In a statement Saturday Roblox said: ""We believe we have identified an underlying internal cause of the outage with no evidence of an external intrusion. We are in the process of performing the necessary engineering and maintenance work to get Roblox back up and running as soon as possible.''

Roblox said on Friday that the outage was ""not related to any specific experiences or partnerships on the platform.’’ This was apparently meant to quash rumors that the trouble was caused by a free burrito giveaway at a digital Chipotle on the Roblox platform.

Speaking on his show on Saturday the news anchor turned his attention to controversial Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson who is set to release a three-part documentary Patriot Purge on 1 November.

According to Insider the special – to be released on the Fox Nation streaming service – will suggest that the Capitol riot was a “false flag” to persecute conservatives.

In a clip shared to Twitter Acosta responded to news of the Tucker Carlson Original show by saying that Americans have “already seen” what the presenter’s “brand of hate-filled rhetoric can do to America” – citing examples such as the demonstrations by white nationalists in Charlottesville in 2017 and the 2019 Walmart shooting in El Paso Texas.

“The reason why federal investigators and millions of Americans are terrified by right-wing violence in this country is because it keeps happening and Tucker Carlson is inciting more of it” he said.

He added: “Tucker is calling his propaganda flick the Patriot Purge? It’s nothing more than Proud Boy porn and the worst part is that a major corporation in America – Fox – is bankrolling it.

“Fox is insisting Tucker’s manifesto will only be seen on its streaming service Fox Nation. Please no matter how you slice it the Murdoch family which controls Fox is cashing in as American democracy is being set ablaze.”

The broadcaster went on to add that people compare the Murdochs to the HBO drama Succession but said it was actually “more like secession”.

“The Murdochs and Tucker Carlson – their primetime pyromaniac – appear to be hell-bent on driving this country into a civil war” he continued.

Twitter users have since praised Acosta for his remarks and “always [telling] it like it is”:

Carlson wasn’t the only person the CNN anchor chose to criticise on his Saturday night show as Acosta also ridiculed Texas senator Ted Cruz.

“I’m starting to think the problem with [him] is not that he went to Cancun it’s that he came back” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL29jdC8zMC90dWNrZXItY2FybHNvbi1jb25kZW1uZWQtY2FwaXRvbC1hdHRhY2stbGl6LWNoZW5ledIBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL29jdC8zMC90dWNrZXItY2FybHNvbi1jb25kZW1uZWQtY2FwaXRvbC1hdHRhY2stbGl6LWNoZW5leQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tucker Carlson condemned over ‘false flag’ claim about deadly Capitol attack,"The conservative Republican Liz Cheney and the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League led condemnation of Fox News and Tucker Carlson after the primetime host announced a series about the supposed “true story” of the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January.

They denounced Carlson for spreading dangerous conspiracy theories in the latest scandal to engulf a man whose popularity belies his record of racist and untrue statements on issues from immigration to racial justice.

“Fox News is giving Tucker Carlson a platform to spread the same type of lies that provoked violence on 6 January” tweeted Cheney a Wyoming representative on the dwindling anti-Trump wing of the Republican party.

Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL wrote to Lachlan Murdoch chief executive of Fox Corporation to demand the series be shelved.

“Clearly Carlson has the right to make outrageous claims” Greenblatt wrote. “But freedom of speech is not freedom of reach. You have no obligation to validate his views with airtime on your platform and I would argue a moral responsibility not to do so.”

Greenblatt has previously called for Carlson to be fired over his advocacy of the racist replacement theory which says Democrats encourage immigration to keep Republicans out of power. Lachlan Murdoch rejected that request.

In the trailer for Carlson’s series Patriot Purge a pundit says: “False flags have happened in this country one of which may have been 6 January.”

Among conspiracy theorists “false flag” events are said to be staged by the government to pursue nefarious ends. Some claim the 9/11 terrorist attacks were false flags. The InfoWars host Alex Jones a Trump ally and supporter has landed in legal and financial jeopardy after claiming the Sandy Hook school shooting of 2012 in which 20 young children and six adults were killed was a false flag attack.

Carlson has called the 6 January riot “a political protest that got out of hand”. He has also claimed it was organised by the FBI.

Cheney said: “As Fox News knows the election wasn’t stolen and 6 January was not a ‘false flag’ operation.”

Five people including a Trump supporter shot by law enforcement and a police officer died around the Capitol attack. The riot followed a “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House at which Trump told supporters to march on Congress and “fight like hell” to overturn the election.

Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection. Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to send him to the Senate for trial but only seven Republican senators joined Democrats in finding Trump guilty and he was not convicted. He is free to run for office again fundraising strongly and dominating polls regarding possible candidates for 2024.

Trump has stuck to his lie that the election was stolen a claim rejected by his own attorney general Republican officials in key states and a succession of judges. The Republican party has swung behind Trump also seeking to play down the events of 6 January a day which has led to more than 600 arrests.

Another outlet owned by Rupert Murdoch the Wall Street Journal was condemned this week for printing a letter in which Trump repeated his election lies.

In another tweet Cheney asked Carlson: “Are you still falsely contending the voting machines were corrupted and the election was stolen?” She included the Twitter handles of Rupert Murdoch Fox News’s chief executive Suzanne Scott its president and executive editor Jay Wallace and the former House speaker Paul Ryan now a member of the Fox board. None commented.

Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.

On Thursday another Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera told the New York Times Carlson was “wonderful” and “provocative” but said things that were “inflammatory and outrageous and uncorroborated”. On Twitter Rivera called the “false flag” claim in Carlson’s trailer “bullshit”.

Carlson’s series will premiere on the Fox Nation streaming service on Monday. Scored to martial drums its trailer says it will tell the “the true story behind 1/6 … the war on terror 2.0 and the plot against the people”.

“The domestic war on terror is here and it’s coming after half of the country” a pundit says over shots of helicopters near the Capitol and the title Patriot Purge.

Carlson says: “The helicopters have left Afghanistan and now they’ve landed here at home.”

On Thursday Carlson claimed: “What we found … bore no resemblance whatsoever to the story that you have heard repeatedly from Liz Cheney and Nancy Pelosi as well as their many obedient mouthpieces in the media. They were lying.”

In his trailer another pundit says: “The left is hunting the right sticking them in Guantánamo Bay for American citizens leaving them to rot.”

The trailer also splices footage of Trump speaking with a shot of Osama bin Laden while scenes outside the Capitol on 6 January are scored to the Battle Hymn of the Republic. The trailer culminates with the refrain of that civil war song: “The truth is marching on.”

In his letter to Rupert Murdoch Greenblatt of the ADL wrote: “Let’s call this what it is: an abject indisputable lie and a blatant attempt to rewrite history.”"

The stock market continues to hit new record highs. But according to famed investor Rick Rule trouble looms ahead

“If you postpone a reckoning you almost always have to pay back with interest” Rule warned in an interview earlier this month.

The former president and CEO of Sprott U.S. Holdings believes that there will be serious consequences to all of the Fed’s easy money policies.

“So the fact that you are able to skate through today and tomorrow and the day after on other people’s money means that ultimately when society itself has to pay the bill the bill is much much much larger.”

The good news? Rule also suggested a few safe-havens to protect yourself.

Save some cash

This might seem counterintuitive since inflation erodes the purchasing power of cash holdings.

But even in this environment — where you don’t earn much from savings accounts — Rule still believes in having some cash on hand.

“A circumstance where you have a dramatic reckoning something like 2008 or 1987 or 1990 liquidity squeezes when they occur in the market take down the price of everything temporarily” he explained to Stansberry Research.

“Having cash gives you the tools and the courage to take advantage of that circumstance rather than being taken advantage of.”

In other words cash acts as dry gunpowder allowing investors to capitalize on opportunities if and when things take a dramatic turn south.

Buy a bit of gold and silver

RHJPhtotoandilustration/Shutterstock

This is an obvious one. Given all of the Fed’s money printing Rule pointed out the importance of owning gold and silver.

And the nice part? You don’t need to own too much of it.

“If you have a circumstance where the fiat goes to hell in a handbasket the upside you get in your gold and silver means that a small insurance premium which is to say a small holding in physical gold and silver offsets a very large deterioration in the purchasing power of your fiat currency.”

“So absolutely save part of your wealth in gold and silver” Rule stressed.

Don’t forget: There are also mining companies that are well-positioned for a precious metals boom.

For instance Wheaton Precious Metals Pan American Silver and Coeur Mining tend to do well with rising silver prices. Meanwhile Barrick Gold Newmont and Freeport-McMoRan could deliver serious returns in a gold rally.

And these days you can build your own safe-haven portfolio just by using your spare pennies.

Own some high-quality farmland

Mark Borbely/Shutterstock

Real estate is another classic hedge against rising inflation and interest rates.

But Rule stated that “the only sector” where he’s increasing his personal exposure to real estate is high-quality farmland — specifically in the Upper Midwest of the U.S.

Story continues

“To the extent that I can buy very high-quality farmland in the U.S. Upper Midwest I’m doing that very aggressively” he said.

More and more investors have warmed up to the idea of farmland and for a good reason: No matter what the economy does people will still need to eat.

As an intrinsically valuable asset farmland can be an ideal hedge because it has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market.

Between 1992 and 2020 U.S. farmland returned an average of 11% per year. Over the same time frame the S&P 500 returned only 8%.

And these days you don’t need to get your hands dirty to get a piece of the action.

New platforms allow you to invest in U.S. farmland by taking a stake in the farm of your choice.

You’ll earn cash income from the leasing fees and crop sales — and any long-term appreciation on top of that.

Live imaging units are known by many names depending on the manufacturer. Garmin's LiveScope is the eponymous version. They all provide a real-time picture of a water body's subsurface in front of the unit. It exhibits exquisitely detailed images of submerged cover and structure including brush piles rock piles and submerged bridges. Rick Ellis a locally well-known angler has made a hobby of locating sunken automobiles in Central Arkansas waters. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission uses it to locate the bodies of drowning victims.

Anglers love live imaging sonar because it shows fish in real time. On your screen you can cast to a single fish. A live imaging unit shows your lure or bait and shows a fish advance on it and strike. Jason Westerberg one of the best known crappie anglers in Arkansas said live imaging has taken the fishing out of fishing and turned it into a video game.

It has also alarmed the angling community which believes that live imaging makes catching crappie so easy that it might be deleterious to crappie populations. Anglers reinforce the perception by posting on social media photos of limits of big crappie they caught with the assistance of live imaging sonar.

Westerberg said that the biggest advantage of live imaging sonar is that it enables an angler to target big crappie exclusively. Anglers worry that this will result in the elimination of older crappie year classes leaving nothing but small crappie.

Andy Yung a Game and Fish Commission fisheries biologist and also an avid crappie angler discredited these concerns on Oct. 20 during the commission's monthly committee meetings.

""There are a lot of concerns are from crappie anglers because crappie anglers keep their fish and crappie are very popular"" Yung said. ""They rank number two behind largemouth bass.

""Live imaging has become popular partly because of its perceived effectiveness"" Yung continued. ""Anglers that use it have learned to back off. If they get too close fish leave.""

To find out if common perceptions are bear weight commission biologists interviewed 700 parties fishing for crappie statewide from Lake Erling to Beaver Lake and all points east and west and in between.

Slightly more than 33% used live imaging Yung said. Anglers using live imaging caught twice as many fish in one hour than anglers not using live imaging. In an eight-hour outing for example a live imaging party catches 18 crappie compared to nine crappie for non-live image anglers.

However both groups of users harvested the same size crappie about 12 inches long and weighing about 1 pound.

Even though live imagers catch more crappie than non-live imagers they don't harvest more crappie Yung said.

""Live imaging anglers are more selective about what they keep"" Yung said. ""They harvested a lower percentage of what they caught.""

My interpretation of that is that live imagers keep only big crappie. Non-live imagers keep a greater diversity of sizes.

In the entire sample of 700 crappie fishing parties only 16 limits were recorded and half of those were caught in Lake Erling Yung said. Among 700 parties only 2.5% caught limits and 40% of those were illegally over the limit Yung said.

I am not worried about recreational anglers catching more and bigger crappie with live imaging. I am concerned about guided parties keeping multiple limits of crappie per day every day. Compounded over a year's time that amount of pressure could theoretically damage a lake's crappie population.

Yung said the survey does not support that theory. Live imaging anglers simply are not harvesting appreciably higher numbers of fish than they did in the pre-live imaging days.

An interesting phenomenon Yung said is the public shaming on social media of anglers posting limits of large crappie. They are being pressured to be discreet and that is good. Photos often generate misperceptions that provoke emotional overreactions.

To the matter at hand the bottom line is that crappie breed so prolifically that they are immune to recreational fishing pressure.

""Crappie have a high turnover rate"" Yung said. ""Their annual mortality rate is 60%. They have boom and bust cycles but crappie adapt.""

Remember when we thought that the Alabama rig would destroy our bass populations? It didn't. I'm still not convinced about live imaging but the data we have so far suggests our fears are misgiven.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vaG93LXRvL2hvdy10by1ydW4tYS01ay10aXBzLWZvci1iZWdpbm5lcnMtYW5kLWJlYXRpbmcteW91ci1yZWNvcmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to run a 5K — tips for beginners and beating your record,"A 5K race is one of the most popular distances for running races as it's relatively short making it very accessible for those who don't run regularly. That said there are a few things you should know before setting off on the course.

Whether you’re hoping to run your first 5K or get faster over the 5K distance we’ve got everything you need to run stronger than ever. A 5K is 3.1 miles in distance and is generally considered to be a good goal for total newbies as well as a fast snappy race for more advanced runners. These should come in handy if you're planning on training for a half-marathon or a Turkey Trot.

Here's everything you need to know about running a 5K.

The best running shoes

Best running watches for tracking your pace

How long will it take to run a 5K?

The average 5K finish time is 39 minutes according to a study by runrepeat and the IAAF. For men the average is faster at 35 minutes and for women the average is slower at 41 minutes. The world record in the 5K is 12:35.36 for men set by Joshua Cheptegei and 14:06.62 for women set by Letesenbet Gidey.

How to find the best 5K training plan for you

Whether you’re just trying to get around the course or you’ve got a time goal in mind the best way to reach your goal is to follow a training plan. There’s a number of free training plans on the market but if you’ve got a newer Garmin running watch there will be a number of coaching plans you can download straight to your watch from the Garmin Connect app.

Some of the other best running apps on the market also have training plans you can download straight to your phone. Apps like Strava  the Nike Run Club app and Map my Run (for users that subscribe) all have training plans that you can follow from the app. There’s also a number of extremely popular Couch-to-5K apps that will take you from not running at all to getting around your first 5K in as little as nine weeks.

The right training plan for you will depend on both your current running level and your goal. If you’re a complete beginner opting for a sub-20 minute 5K plan might be a little challenging but for more experienced runners the Couch to 5K training plan might be a little basic. Most training plans will gradually increase your mileage each week as you approach race day and will be around six to nine weeks long. A good training plan will give you a mix of faster runs to work on your speed and longer runs to work on your strength.

What to wear when running a 5K

If you’re running your first 5K getting the right gear for race day can make all the difference. Sure there are endless gadgets and gizmos you can buy but in our eyes the essentials are a watch a pair of running shoes and a sports bra for female runners.

Sure you don’t necessarily need a running watch but using one for your training can help you keep track of your progress and more accurately record your pace distance and splits on the run. We think the best running watch for beginner runners is the Garmin Forerunner 55  which has a bright screen that’s easy to see on the run built-in GPS and the ability to download coaching plans to the watch. If it’s out of your price range or you’re looking for something a little more high-tech have a browse of the best running watches here.

While it's definitely on the more expensive side the support offered with the Lululemon Enlite Bra is second to none. It's available in a large number of bra sizes it's lightweight and breathable and the hook-and-eye fastening makes the bra easy to get on and off even when wet.

How to run a 5K faster

If you’re looking to get faster over a 5K distance you’ll need to add speedwork and strength-training sessions to your plan. While running more miles will help build your endurance it’s speedwork that will really help you get quicker. For more information on how to add speedwork to your weekly running schedule take a look at our how to run faster guide. That said if you’re following a training plan it’s likely to have at least one speed session per week to help you improve.

Strength training is also an important part of running faster. If getting faster is the goal focus on a sprinter’s workout of plyometric movements like jump squats or box jumps that work on the explosive power in your muscles.

You might also not be getting faster because you’re constantly taking time out with a recurring injury. If this is the case it’s worth working with a trainer to address the problem and then following a careful training plan to ensure you’re not overloading the body and doing too much too soon. Check out our beginner's guide to running — top tips from a running coach for a good plan.

What should you eat before running a 5K?

Unlike a half marathon or a marathon you won’t need to load up on carbs before a 5K. That said the right pre-race nutrition is important and will prevent you from struggling with stomach issues on the course. Experts recommend that you get to the start line well hydrated but this means ensuring that you’re hydrated for the days before the race rather than downing water on the morning of the race.

The chances are you’ll have enough energy in your muscles to not eat anything on the morning of the race but if you do prefer to eat opt for something light one to two hours before the start of your 5K. Keep the meal low in fiber and fat as they can take a while to digest and opt for something like porridge or peanut butter and toast. Make sure you experiment with what works best for you and your body before race day — the golden rule is nothing new!

On the course you won’t need to worry about gels or sweets to get you around the course. Also be careful not to take on too much water on the course. If you’re well-hydrated going into the race you shouldn’t need to take on too much liquid on the run. As a general rule sip water to thirst; don’t stop at every drink station because other runners are.

IT,Gartner,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9waGlsLWdhcnRuZXItaGFzLWJlZW4tYS1rZXktdG8tc2hhcGluZy1sYWtlLWNpdHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phil Gartner has been a key to shaping Lake City,"LAKE CITY — On Oct. 11 the Lake City City Council and Mayor Mark Nichols presented Phil Gartner with the key to the city.

Gartner who spent 50 years serving the city in various capacities — from being city attorney and a member of the city council to serving on boards and commissions — before deciding in 2020 not to run for re-election. In that time he helped the city get a new hospital connected to Mayo Clinic purchase a camping park that is a jewel of the region and voted for changes to U.S. Highway 61 that reshaped the road through downtown Lake City.

""I had some people say 'They probably should have given you the key a long time ago'"" Gartner said.

Still he said he was honored the city chose to recognize his years of service to Lake City.

A native of Preston Gartner graduated high school in 1957 from there with his high school sweetheart. Sixty years later he and Dana are still married and enjoying the beauty of the town along Lake Pepin.

When did you start serving Lake City?

We moved to Lake City in 1966 right after I finished grad school (at William Mitchell College of Law). My old football coach from Preston Joe Denzer he left Preston and became football coach here. Dana and I kept in touch with him while we were in college.

He told us to check out the town. We loved this little town. We knew we wanted to sail and also ski. There was a ski hill about 9 miles up the road. It was such a beautiful area we decided to stay.

I started practicing law in 1966 and after about four years I was appointed city attorney which was a part-time job. I did that for 37 years.

What were some of the big changes to the city that you helped with?

I helped the city with the purchase of Hok Si La Park. It was a Boy Scout camp and they'd maintained it very well. The camp was on a 350-acre parcel. There was a dike road that led to a big dining hall. The city thought it would be an ideal location for a park kind of like a state park in the vein of Frontenac which is right up the road.

But the Boy Scouts had a couple of requirements. One was that it be maintained as a place for primitive camping. The other was the price. They wanted $500000 but the city didn't have that kind of money. We put together grants from the federal and state government to help and that covered 90 percent of the cost.

How did you help change the way Mayo Clinic delivers health care around the region?

I was involved as a negotiator with that as well. This was probably 20 years ago.

We became the first outreach facility for Mayo Clinic from Rochester. This was the start of Mayo bringing medical facilities to small communities. They were looking for a medical facility that would be a feeder for Rochester. Later they did this in many many different communities. They could send clients patients from Lake City to Rochester.

Medical facilities were starting to change at that time. This was an experiment on their part.

Lake City had its own hospital. It was successful but it was very old and the local doctors were trying to do everything. They can't do that anymore.

At the same time Fairview Hospital in the Twin Cities was very interested in doing outreach as well. We had to decide which of those would be best and we picked Mayo. It was closer to Lake City and there was already an attachment with the local physicians to send their patients to Mayo.

They built a new hospital but we had a nursing home at the time and we wanted to include it as part of Mayo's operation.

This all became a forerunner of how Mayo would operate.

How well has this worked for Lake City and Mayo Clinic?

It’s been good. Not always perfect but we had an arrangement with them that they had to honor the long-term commitment to Lake City. It was a 30-year agreement which we are approaching the end of in about 10 years.

But I knew we needed a different approach to medicine and care. The doctors we had at the time were two old-timers. And newer doctors did not want to work the way the old-timers did.

What was your next big step in serving Lake City?

When I retired as the city attorney after 37 years I was hustled to go for the city council. I served two (non-consecutive) four-year terms and in between I served on several boards and commissions. When I look at my total it’s been 50 years working with the city.

Hok Si La and Mayo are always the two accomplishments that stand out for me.

Were you part of the vote on the new alignment for U.S. Highway 61?

Yes. I was not in favor of it in the beginning but when I started looking at it and talked to the (county) highway department and the department of transportation (MnDOT) I saw it was a good thing. It slows traffic down which is a good thing especially in the summer with all the marina traffic.

MnDOT did a marvelous job of improving the highway through Lake City.

With 55 years in one town you've got to have some great memories.

The marina is the largest recreational marina on the Mississippi River. It's got slips for 600 boats right in this small community. When we first came to town we bought a 20-foot sailboat. It was the first fiberglass sailboat in the marina here.

Our three children grew up here. Our son was a dock boy. Our two daughters were lifeguards at the beach. It’s been an enchanted area and people who grew up here are moving back.

A lot of towns have lost some of their businesses but we're lucky to have the amenities we have a great grocery store a hardware store and the marina.

It’s a lovely community with the bluffs and the river. Well we call it a lake but it’s really a wide spot in the Mississippi.

The Tommies rode sophomore running back Hope Adebayo and a dominant defense to their 30th consecutive regular season victory at O'Shaughnessy Stadium a streak that stretches back to 2014.

They overcame two special teams gaffs to defeat Marist 27-7 and improve to 4-1 in Pioneer League play and 5-2 overall.

Adebayo who entered the game second in Pioneer League action in rushing at 83.8 yards per game topped that total in the first half when he had 112 yards on 12 carries including a 30-yard score. He finished with 191 yards on 27 carries with two scores.

The St. Thomas defense didn't allow that many yards in total holding Marist to 167 yards while the Tommies gained 392. Senior defensive back Luke Glenna had an interception and a fumble recovery in the first half but it was far from a blowout early because of issues with the St. Thomas punting unit.

Punter Colby Gartner had a snap go high over his head on the final play of the first quarter which gave Marist the ball 1st and goal from the Tommies two-yard line. The Red Foxes would grab their lone score of the game on the first play of the second quarter a quarterback keeper by Austin Day.

Another special teams miscue midway through the second quarter this time when Tommies quarterback Cade Sexauer took the snap and went to punt gave Marist the ball at the St. Thomas 24. Six plays later the Red Foxes had it fourth-and-goal on the Tommies' two-yard-line when defensive back Isaiah Hall sacked Day for an eight-yard loss.

St. Thomas opened the second half leading just 13-7. They immediately forced a three-and-out and went on a 15-play 83-yard drive that was capped by Sexauer lunging into the end zone on fourth-and-goal from the one to make it 20-7.

The senior QB passed for 139 yards and a score and also rushed for 34 yards and that third quarter touchdown.

Adebayo would cap the scoring on a 28-yard run with 5:55 left in the game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvdmVnYXMtcGQtaG91c2UtcGFydHktdHVybnMtaW50by1kZWFkbHktZHJpdmUtYnktc2hvb3RpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vegas PD: House party turns into deadly drive-by shooting,"LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — Las Vegas police are investigating a deadly drive-by shooting that happened during the overnight hours on Sunday.

Technology will drive the change and its immense possibilities— in healthcare sustainable aviation to clean energy—were discussed at a recent two-day GE New HorAIzons Summit organised in collaboration with CNBC TV18 and Moneycontrol.

Industry leaders trailblazers and innovators came together on October 6 and 7 to chart the road to a future enabled by artificial intelligence machine learning the internet of things data analytics and more.

""The Prime Minister in his early days of taking charge laid out the path for India's transformation. One of the pillars on that path was the technology-first model of governance"" Minister of Civil Aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia said in his opening note capturing the growing importance of technology for the industry.

Tech and healthcare

Technology has helped move healthcare from the confines of buildings to the remotest corners of the country with a click of a button. This shift was at play as coronavirus restricted the movement of people.

The iron triangle of healthcare— cost quality and healthcare access— and how technology can make a difference was talked at length during a panel discussion on Day One.

Wipro GE Healthcare MD Dr Shravan Subramanyam said scaling and upskilling could change the direction of the iron triangle.

Technology has helped doctors to be adaptive to remote caregiving. In a fireside chat GE Healthcare CDO and CTO Amit Phadnis said AI had made it possible to monitor ICU patients more efficiently while tech innovation had made healthcare available to a much larger population.

AI had made precision medicine a reality while wearable technology could be used to glean health insights for a better treatment. Solutions and possibilities were endless.

Sustainable aviation stirred a lively discussion with Air Deccan founder GR Gopinath and Captain Amit Singh of Safety Matters focusing on reducing carbon emission.

A shift in mindset has to be accompanied by technological and production change in the industry to reduce its environmental burden.

Changing the climate for better

As the Glasgow climate summit nears a large part of Day Two of the GE Summit was dedicated to how technology could help India and the world embrace clean energy while cutting down emissions.

As part of the Paris agreement India has pledged to do its share to check climate change. The country has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 33-35 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.

This requires a relentless dedication to adopting technologies that aren't only clean but also smart. Lord Adair Turner of Energy Transitions and Ramesh Nair of Adani Solar examined the solutions and challenges the switch to green energy faced.

India's plan to get 40 percent of its energy from alternative sources by installing 450 GW of renewable capacity was hailed by the panel.

It identified the pace of investments in technology cost of capital and land as well as legal roadblocks as some of the key challenges in meeting the goal.

India was doing well on the renewable energy front— rooftop solar net metering and the Kusum scheme for solar energy in agriculture— but the policy regulatory framework should be drawn up to scale these technologies.

The panel was of the opinion that a good balance of demand and supply of alternative energy (green hydrogen specifically) needed to be created by the government by understanding industrial energy use.

Something old something new

In a fireside chat Dr Danielle Merfeld VP and CTO GE Renewable Energy highlighted four core areas to cut carbon emissions—technology innovation to lower the costs of the energy ecosystem the dispatching of renewable energy making the power grid reliable and making this loop scalable and better over time.

The participants including Sam Kimmins Head of RE100 at The Climate Group and Sankar Chakraborti CEO Acuite Ratings and Research Limited envisaged public-private partnerships playing a key role in scaling technologies.

A change in mindset that would drive accountability and promote technological innovation bettering the old tech and bringing in the new is how they mapped the way forward.

Complementary renewable sources of energy coming together for consistent access made for an insightful masterclass on GE Renewable Hybrids.

No discussion on technology can be complete without cybersecurity as the world gets more digitised. Alain Sanchez Senior Evangelist at Fortinet said cybercriminals were growing sophisticated with every technological breakthrough.

A lack of bug bounty programs which encourage developers or others to report vulnerabilities by offering them compensation was one of the challenges facing India. The cybersecurity sphere in the country also lacked deterrents leading to an increase in the crime rate. For a country where internet penetration is growing by the day it needs to firewall itself from cybercriminals

Through lively discussions the GE New HorAIzons summit opened up a whole new world where technology innovation promises to improve lives clean up the environment offer solutions and build a better world for future generations.

A thermoelectric generator is a device that converts thermal energy into electrical – a topic that has garnered much interest due to the global decarbonization trend. The new generator concept is based on a complex carbon nanostructure. During the heating process the quantum electrodynamic processes occur activating thermoelectric generation.

“We heat the structure which is created in a certain way and has a complex stoichiometry. Due to heating the interaction of electronic subsystem and structural lattice is launched. As a result the carbon nanostructure created by us begins to generate electrons. As a result of such a quantum-physical interaction under thermal exposure the electric current appears” said Olga Kvashenkina Director of the Scientific and Technical Center SPbPU.

The researchers completed theoretical studies devoted to the efficiency of the device then created a digital model and conducted digital tests considerably reducing the technology development time.

The simulation results were then verified during the experiments carried out using atomic force microscopes various types of spectrometers and a set of research equipment established specifically for this development. Currently the project is at the hardware prototype stage. The device has a small size – measuring 5×2 mm and 1 mm in height – which makes it portable.

“The use of the thermoelectric generator is crucial not only for domestic use but also for the industry. For example a device is placed on the surface of the turbine engine heated up to 1500 degrees and this heat turning into electrical energy is transferred to sensors designed to monitor the state of this engine” mentioned Olga Kvashenkina. “As for domestic use now we are working to ensure that our development can charge the devices with low energy consumption such as electronic clocks watering systems for indoor plants and similar devices. In the future we will strive to establish portable thermoelectric chargers for mobile phones.”

The heat from the central heating system will be enough to generate a sufficient current to charge household appliances. It is assumed that a thermoelectric generator should be installed near the heating system. The obtained electricity will be transferred to the electrical wiring and charge small devices. One of the key points is the safety of this system for both the user and the electronic equipment connected to this device.

Additionally the system is designed for operation at very high temperatures due to its heat-resistant carbon nanostructure components ensures its suitability for industrial applications. Its refractory body can also be developed for industrial application if required. In the case of domestic use the temperature of the room heating system will be sufficient for the device to generate electricity; no special requirements for materials of the device’s body will be needed. Therefore the device can be made financially affordable for ordinary consumers.

The final product will be implemented by an industrial partner at the end of 2021. The project is conducted within the framework of the program World-class research center Advanced digital technologies of SPbPU.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzbHMuY29tL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMS8xMC8zMC92aXJnaW5pYS1ob3VzZS1vZi1kZWxlZ2F0ZXMtZGlzdHJpY3QtMjItZ2VuZXJhbC1lbGVjdGlvbi1yZXN1bHRzLW9uLW5vdi0yLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virginia House of Delegates District 22 general election results on Nov. 2 2021,"Del.

According to the latest reports the US Army has moved a step closer towards the deployment of directed energy weapons (DEWs) for countering its adversaries.

Earlier this week General Dynamics reportedly paired up with Epirus Inc. for delivering a directed energy weapon that uses high-power microwave technology. The weapon developed under this collaboration will be fitted on the Stryker combat vehicles manufactured by General Dynamics for the US Army.

In July this year the RCCTO held combat drills for a variety of futuristic scenarios which involved a number of aerial threats using a laser weapon system. Even though the details of the weapon were not revealed at that time the recent development in the high-energy laser weapon system indicates the participants in the standoff.

The New Laser Weapon

The US Army Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) awarded a contract to General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems (GA-EMS) and Boeing for producing a prototype of a 300 kilowatt-class solid-state distributed gain high energy laser weapon system. Work under this contract will be completed in San Diego and Albuquerque according to a company press release.

“The partnership combines both companies’ expertise in Directed Energy to deliver best-in-class combat-ready protection for the warfighter with unmatched speed performance safety and affordability.

Specifically the system will leverage GA-EMS’ scalable Distributed Gain Laser technology with Boeing’s beam director and precision acquisition tracking and pointing software to provide a complete demonstrator with sophisticated laser and beam control” the press release said.

“The high power compact laser weapon subsystem prototype that GA-EMS will deliver under this contract will produce a lethal output greater than anything fielded to date” Scott Forney president of GA-EMS said in the press release. The weapon system delivered under this contract will be deployed not only against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but also against missiles.

The design of the prototype demonstrated in the contract will incorporate two seventh-generation lasers which will be developed by General Atomics. “Recent architectural improvements have enabled our single-beam DG Lasers to achieve comparable beam quality to fiber lasers in a very simple design without the need for beam combination” said Dr. Michael Perry vice president for lasers and advanced sensors at GA-EMS.

“This technology represents a leap-ahead capability for air and missile defense that is necessary to support the Army’s modernization efforts and defeat next-generation threats in a multi-domain battlespace” Forney added.

The “distributed gain laser” is a liquid-based laser and is thus different from the 50–150-kilowatt fiber-based lasers which the military has adopted till now. The distributed gain lasers provide a smaller size weight and power considerations which enable the system to be scaled up for more powerful laser beams.

The US Navy had deployed the first high-energy laser weapon called LaWS (Laser Weapon System) on the USS Ponce in the year 2014. This laser weapon system reportedly had an output of 30 kilowatt. Military lasers usually tend to be in the 30-kilowatt to 100-kilowatt range. This is mainly used for shooting down small drones.

The new 300-kilowatt laser system is part of a US Army project for developing defensive lasers which are capable of shooting down incoming threats.

Last year the Army demonstrated a 10-kilowatt laser weapon as it defeated small mortar rounds. Justin Bronk a research fellow at UK security think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said that powerful lasers can strike bigger targets and can also engage multiple targets quickly.

“It will allow the system to engage a greater density of incoming threats and also potentially engage threats which offer a shorter engagement window either due to speed or very low altitude flight trajectory” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTAvMzAvd2VhcG9ucy1tYWtlcnMtZGVsYXlzLXZhY2NpbmUtcHJvdGVzdHMtNTE3NzUw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weapons makers prepare for delays as vaccine protests flare up,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/30/weapons-makers-delays-vaccine-protests-517750 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTAvMzAvd2VhcG9ucy1tYWtlcnMtZGVsYXlzLXZhY2NpbmUtcHJvdGVzdHMtNTE3NzUw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcm15cmVjb2duaXRpb24uY29tL2RlZmVuc2VfbmV3c19vY3RvYmVyXzIwMjFfZ2xvYmFsX3NlY3VyaXR5X2FybXlfaW5kdXN0cnkvdW5pdGVkX3N0YXRlc19wbGFuc190b19pbnRlZ3JhdGVfdW5tYW5uZWRfdHVycmV0X29uX20xYTJfYWJyYW1zX21haW5fYmF0dGxlX3RhbmsuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States plans to integrate unmanned turret on M1A2 Abrams main battle tank,"According to a press release published by U.S. Congressman Tim Ryan $65 million has been secured to upgrade the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank which is produced at the Lima Tank Plant Lima OH. The funding secured by Congressman Ryan will extend the service life of the main battle tank and also integrate an unmanned turret.

Tim Ryan has been a longtime defender of the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima most recently using his position on the powerful House Appropriations Committee to help secure $65 million to upgrade the M1 Abrams main battle tank.

The plant is currently operated by General Dynamics Land Systems and employs at least 931 people in the surrounding community. General Dynamics plays an influential role in the economy across the state spending $187.7 million with 778 different Ohio suppliers in 2020.

The M1A2 Abrams is a third-generation tank that boasts several innovative features including a multi-fuel turbine engine composite armor automated fire control system as well as enhanced protection for its crew. The tank has been in service for over forty years.

The funding secured by Congressman Ryan will extend the service life of the tank and also integrate an unmanned turret. Additionally it will help to develop the physical architecture and mechanical requirements needed to add an Autoloader and Automated Ammunition Handling System to the Abrams evaluate current and emerging candidates for an Integrated Active Protection System and develop new Abrams mobility and power architecture for conversion to a Hybrid Electric Drive propulsion and power generation system.

The Defense spending bill has been passed by the House Appropriations Committee and must pass the full House of Representatives before moving to the Senate.

The M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank (MBT) has been in service with the United States armed forces since 1980. Since then it has gone through dozens of upgrades and has been the baseline variant of several vehicles. The M1A2 SEP V3 or M1A2C is the latest variant in the family of M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks. The first M1A2C MBTs were delivered in July 20 2020 to the U.S. Army. This version rectifies many of the space weight and power issues identified during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM and will be the foundational variant for all future incremental upgrades. In addition to having improved survivability the Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 can host any mature technology the Army deems operationally relevant. Improvements focus on increasing the electrical power margin Vehicle Health Management Systems integrated counter-improvised explosive device protection a new auxiliary power unit enabling silent watch embedded training and an ammunition data link. It is the most reliable Abrams tank ever produced minimizes the Army’s logistic footprint and leads the Army in enterprise-level connectivity to maintenance and supply systems.

The M1A2 SEP V4 or M1A2D is now in development featuring the third generation (3GEN) FLIR the cornerstone technology that will provide tank crews the ability to identify enemy targets farther than ever before. The 3GEN FLIR will be an upgrade to both sights and will be common with other combat platforms. With the upgrade the Abrams will integrate a color camera eye-safe laser range finder and a cross-platform laser pointer to facilitate multi-domain battle into the commander’s sight. In addition to a lethality upgrade the M1A2 SEPv4 will include full-embedded training to maximize crew proficiency of the system. This program began early enough to onboard any technology the Army deems critical to the future battlefield to include artificial intelligence autonomy APS (Active Protection System) or advanced sensors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhdW50b25nYXpldHRlLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3RhdW50b24tZ2F6ZXR0ZV9jbjEzOTkzNzU30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George Costa Obituary,"George Costa 91 of Raynham passed away on Thursday October 28 2021 at Life Care Center of Raynham.

As scientific research continues to connect pesticide exposures to harmful human health effects a new report ranked the efforts of 17 major U.S. food manufacturers to reduce pesticides in agriculture. The report was conducted by As You Sow and found General Mills Lamb Weston Del Monte and PepsiCo to score the highest when it came their actions to reduce the growing risk of pesticide use.

The report Pesticides in the Pantry: Transparency & Risk in Food Supply Chains ranked 17 major U.S. food manufacturers “based on their performance on 28 indicators designed to measure how effectively companies are reducing pesticide risk and improving agricultural resiliency.” Out of 27 possible points General Mills (16 points) Lamb Weston (15) Del Monte (14) and PepsiCo (14) scored the highest while Post and B&G Foods scored the lowest (0 points each) followed by J.M. Smucker (1 point).

“Investors expect companies to be planning for the future and preparing for the effects of climate change” Danielle Fugere As You Sow’s president and a contributor to the report said. “For food companies climate resilience requires investing in agricultural systems that restore ecosystems and soil health and dramatically reduce the use of toxic chemicals.”

While there are “new initiatives that aim to transition land to regenerative farming practices that are better for the environment farmers and consumers” this report confirms that “these efforts could be thwarted by continued use of pesticides as companies for the most part continue to ignore this important component of risk and resiliency.”

The harmful health effects of pesticide exposure includes cancer cardiovascular disease birth and developmental defects liver and kidney disease and obesity according to scientific research. And pesticide-based agriculture is harmful to the environment as studies demonstrate it causes loss of critical pollinator species reduced biodiversity and toxins in waterways.

Several companies made new commitments to reduce pesticide risk according to the report which is an improvement compared to 2019. But “problematically companies continue to avoid addressing and accounting for pesticide use as a meaningful component of promoting agricultural resiliency” according to the report. Therefore As You Sow offers “alternative solutions to support farmers in transitioning away from chemical-dependent farming systems” such as certified organic farming integrated pest management and regenerative agriculture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDA3MDczL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Donald J.

Stokes was 83.

Her husband died in 2015.

The Stokes family sent us this obituary:

Jeanette “Jay” Stokes wife and life partner of former congressman and civil rights champion Louis Stokes passed away peacefully in Cleveland on Oct. 30 2021 at the age of 83.

Jay was born to parents Thomas and Allie on February 26 1938 in Trenton New Jersey. She grew up with her dear sister and best friend Arline Dixon. As a child —at the age of nine years old — Jay was diagnosed with Rheumatic and Scarlett Fever and confined to the UH Rainbow Babies and Children Hospital for two years of her young life.

Ever the fighter Jay went on to beat the illnesses — though she was told that she would be unable to have children of her own. After graduating from John Hay High School as a young African American woman Jay attended the Cleveland Institute of Art and explored various career pursuits — from a position with the Cleveland Board of Education to a successful modeling career after attending the Artha-Jon School of Modeling in Cleveland later teaching at the Earl Wheeler-School of Modeling and the Billy Tilton Finishing School and Modeling Agency.

Jay was set up on a blind date at Cleveland’s historic Karamu House with Louis Stokes a young lawyer with three children. She would joke she was skeptical at first— an older man with three kids from a previous marriage. Nevertheless she quickly fell in love with him and their shared drive determination and desire to make the world a more equitable place. In 1960 at the age of 22 Jay married Louis at East Mt. Zion Baptist Church and became stepmother to three young children.

Stokes family

In 1962 Jay beat the odds when she welcomed her own daughter Lori who went on to have a successful national career in journalism.

Despite her reluctance to be in the spotlight Jay and Lou became a team — successfully campaigning for each of his 15 terms in Congress attending every state dinner and political engagement and forming powerful relationships of her own with world leaders.

She attended Democratic conventions around the country and accompanied her husband on fact-finding CODELS (congressional delegations) around the globe. From friendships with Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter to audiences with Pope John Paul II Jay carried out her role with the utmost grace and poise. Together she and Lou — whom she lovingly called ‘Cap’ — were unstoppable.

Jay was also a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus Spouses organization which worked to enhance the conditions of minorities throughout the nation and was a member of the Congressional Club which sponsored the First Ladies Luncheon in honor of the wife of the sitting President of the United States.

Jay dedicated her life to her husband and her children. They remember her fondly as a woman who wore many hats around the house. As her son Chuck remembers she could pick up a screwdriver and measuring tape to repair something at home one minute only to be dolled up and fashionable for an event that evening. Her daughter Shelley lovingly remembers her reading poetry and exploring the World Book Encyclopedia with them. Her daughter Angie remembers her detailed and exquisite decorating. Lastly her daughter Lori affectionately remembers her beautiful writing and unending dedication as a mother always her children’s biggest cheerleader. Their plight was her plight; their success was her success. But Lori ponders “The truth of the matter is how do you put into a sentence what someone has done in a lifetime?”

After her children were old enough Jay revisited her career and became a multimillion-dollar realtor with Long & Foster in Maryland where she and Lou had a second residence because of his congressional career. She also was a field director for the Miss D.C./U.S.A. pageants.

Jay was the receipt of numerous awards. In 1979 she was selected by Hurray for Black Women as the Wife and Mother of the Year. In 1986 she was recognized for her role as a member of the Board of Directors for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. In 1994 she was recognized by The Phillis Wheatley Association for her Years of Outstanding Community Service. In 1998 she was honored by General Mills Inc. for outstanding leadership in health education and in 2015 she was honored by Mt. Zion Church in Oakwood Village as an Amazing Woman of Courage.

She also had a quiet reserved side. She was a brilliant artist who enjoyed the simple things such as spending time with her grandkids and listening to Johnny Mathis’ albums. She enjoyed bowling and trips to Martha’s Vineyard and St. Michaels.

Jay is preceded in death by her husband of 55 years Louis Stokes. She is survived by her daughters Lori Stokes Shelley Stokes-Hammond Angela Stokes her son Louis “Chuck” Stokes and daughter-in-law Trudy Gallant-Stokes. Her grandchildren Alexandra Thompson Nicolette Stokes Thompson Kelley Stokes-Samuel Kimberly Stokes Brett Hammond Eric Hammond and Grant Hammond. She is survived by her great-granddaughter Ava Hammond. She is also survived by her sister Arline Dixon nephew Edward “Chip” Dixon her niece Margaux Francis and her nephew Cordell Stokes.

Jeanette Stokes was many things to many people and dedicated her life to others. Above all else she would describe herself as a loyal wife and mother.

In Congressman Stokes’ autobiography “The Gentleman from Ohio” finished days before his passing in 2015 he wrote: “To my beloved wife Jay who has been the bedrock for me through all the years in all I was able to do. The best wife a man could have. In memory of the complete and fulfilled life she gave me.”

What a wonderful life she gave us all."

Here's why it didn't happen.

Imagine General Motors owning Ford. It nearly happened until it didn’t. TheDetroitBureau.com looks at what nearly happened and why it didn’t.

William (“Billy”) Crapo Durant founder of General Motors. (Photo Credit: GM)

William Crapo Durant — Billy to his friends — became President of the Buick Motor Co. after its founder David Buick left the company along with $100000. All was going well at Buick. One night Durant leaves the office to have dinner with his daughter Margery. There he is called to the phone. It is Benjamin Briscoe Jr. president of the Maxwell-Briscoe Co.

The conversation was recalled by Durant in notes for a never published autobiography and later recounted by Buick historian Lawrence Gustin in his book “Billy Durant.”

“Hello Billy I have a most important matter to discuss with you and want you to take the first train to Chicago.”

Durant answered “What’s the big idea Ben?”

“Don’t ask me to explain; it’s the biggest thing in the country. There’s millions in it. Can you come?”

“Impossible too busy sorry” Durant said. “But I can see you here. Why don’t you take the 10 o’clock Grand Trunk arriving at 7 o’clock tomorrow morning? I will meet you at the station and we will have breakfast together.”

Briscoe agreed and boarded the train later that night.

A meeting begets a big idea

The next day the two meet with Briscoe telling Durant that a J.P. Morgan partner and Maxwell-Briscoe financier was toying with the idea of a large merger of automakers nearly two dozen. Durant had his doubts.

Henry Ford above was mired in the Selden patent case when Durant proposed buying his company.

The plan involved too many companies and would take too much to resolve any differences. Durant countered with another proposal one involving fewer automakers that would sell medium-priced cars in large numbers such as Ford Reo Buick and Maxwell-Briscoe.

Upon further discussion they contacted Ransom E. Olds who ran Reo and Henry Ford who agreed to meet with Briscoe and Durant at Durant’s suite in the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit.

Briscoe opened the meeting stating he wanted the group to formulate a consolidation plan the could be presented to J.P. Morgan. But Ford and Olds wanted cash for their companies at least $3 million each.

This proved to be a big hurdle. With the chances of success fading the final straw proved to be a short item in the New York Times stating that the first large consolidation of automakers was coming and would be named International Motor Co. and capitalized at $25 million.

Morgan withdrew its support. The big idea was dead.

Durant carries on

Morgan may not have liked the idea but Durant did.

Before long he contacted the Olds Motor Works in Lansing Michigan about consolidating Buick and Olds with both companies owned by a holding company to be named General Motors.

Olds had fallen on hard times after the departure of their founder Ransom Olds several years before and were anxious to consolidate. On Sept. 16 1908 General Motors was incorporated starting an acquisition spree that led Durant to acquire the Albert Champion Co. the Oakland Motor Car Co. and Cadillac Automobile Co. among dozens of others.

But one prize still eluded him: Ford Motor Co.

Durant tries again

In 1909 Durant approached Ford’s business manager James Couzens about General Motors’ interest in acquiring Ford Motor Co. Couzens said he would talk it over with Mr. Ford. At the time Ford was fighting George Selden a patent lawyer who was granted a patent for the automobile.

Selden formed the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers and began collecting a 0.75% royalty on all cars sold. But automakers had to get a license from the ALAM. Having been refused one by the ALAM Ford built cars anyway. Selden sued and the case dragged on for years. Ford was still battling Selden when Durant’s offer arrived. With victory uncertain and huge costs being incurred with the installation of the automobile industry’s first assembly line Ford couldn’t help but be swayed by the offer.

“I had reason to believe that if we were successful General Motors would not require any more motor car companies” Durant writes.

At the time of Durant’s offer Henry Ford had just introduced the first moving assembly line for cars. (Photo Credit: Ford Motor Co.)

Ford agreed to sell his company to General Motors for $8 million. His terms: $2 million in cash $2 million in stock and the remaining $4 million paid during the next three years at 5% interest. But Durant’s acquisition fee left GM short on cash. Durant turned to the National City Bank of New York to ask for a $2 million loan even as GM’s board of directors gives Durant the authority to buy Ford on Oct. 26 1909. But the bank was unwilling to take a risk on the fledgling industry let alone Durant’s new company.

The answer was no.

The fallout

Ultimately Ford would prove victorious over Selden upon appeal and the assembly line proved a wise innovation. By the 1920s Ford would control half the U.S. automobile market with a single vehicle the Model T. Ultimately through a combination of factors GM would surpass Ford become the top seller of automobiles in the U.S. for decades.

However one wonders what might have been had things turned out differently in 1909.

While those same bankers later admitted they made a mistake Durant harbored no regrets. “I never would have built up that business the way Ford did” he recalled. “The Ford business would never have been what it is without Henry Ford who has done more for America than any other man — more for the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXJzLWJhdHRlcnktZmlyZXMtZmVhci1sYXctc3VpdHMtZ20tYm9sdC0yMDIxMTAzMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the GM Bolt recall and EV fires are affecting the big shift to electric vehicles in the U.S,"Jason Dougherty Chevrolet Bolt owner at his home in Swedesboro N.J.

Jason Dougherty bought his 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV brand new. He’s a car guy who generally trades up every six months or year when something new catches his eye.

The fully electric-powered Bolt which now has 39000 miles on it has been the longest car relationship he’s enjoyed in years. Dougherty especially likes its big savings on gasoline.

But now that relationship is on the skids as the 46-year-old assistant dean at Delaware Technical Community College is seeking to secure a buyback offer from General Motors after the car was recalled over concerns about their batteries catching fire.

While GM developed a fix more than 140000 Bolts worldwide and the future production of Chevrolet’s EV were trapped in limbo.

The problem arose because of fires with the Bolt EVs 14 confirmed by GM which the company pinpointed to two manufacturing defects — a torn battery anode and a folded separator in the same battery cell. The fires appeared to happen mostly while recharging or still plugged in. Or when batteries were nearly full. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has received more than 300 complaints related to the Bolt batteries but not all of these have been for fires.

The 2019-2020 Hyundai Kona recalls were far smaller — just 4696 and 6707 vehicles in each instance according to NHTSA — while 43000 Porsche Taycans and 2200 Volvo Polestar EVs were recalled for total loss of power not fire hazards.

The recall of all Bolts produced to date represents arguably the most visible and significant setback for the electric vehicle in the U.S. not just for the country’s largest automaker but for the industry’s nascent transition from gas-powered engines.

The concerns surrounding the Bolt come as all major automakers have released sweeping and ambitious production targets over the next decade for electric vehicles and billions of dollars have been earmarked for everything from the conversion of assembly lines to the construction of charging stations.

The auto industry seems to unveil new EV investments almost every week. General Motors announced last week a program to install up to 40000 EV chargers in communities where charging access has been limited beginning in 2022. And Hertz announced an initial purchase of 100000 Teslas by the end of 2022 plus new EV charging infrastructure to power them.

“The market is still really small for EVs so it’s not as if there are millions and millions of buyers here in the U.S. just waiting to get them” said Jessica Caldwell an automobile industry analyst with Edmunds.com. “So I think it is good that they get their kinks out ... before it becomes mainstream.”

GM has worked closely with the battery manufacturer Seoul-based LG Electronics to develop a solution which they announced in mid-September: In earlier models the company will replace the entire battery but in later models new software will be installed to check the battery cells for defects. This allows the company to save money but also makes the recall less unwieldy because replacing 140000 EV batteries could take a long time.

General Motors has announced plans to restart its Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan on Monday to build Bolts mainly to provide courtesy transportation for EV customers during their recall repairs. But the freeze on sales of Bolts in dealer inventory remains in place.

General Motors’ recent announcement that it has found a fix for the Bolt’s battery problem has eased some fears but only some. Even with the repair announcement owners are mulling if their cars are safe to operate throwing a wrench into GM’s electric-future vision.

The recall has generated more than its share of news because it has unfolded slowly with multiple chapters. First GM warned Bolt owners only to charge the vehicles to 90% of capacity and park them outside because of fire risk. Then came the first recall impacting 60000 vehicles worldwide a number that would eventually reach 140000.

And then on Aug. 20 GM ordered a complete shutdown of new-vehicle production or recall repairs while a fix was determined. Now that a fix has been identified repairs began earlier this month GM said.

Facing the mounting concern Dougherty is torn on how to charge his car. His charger cord will reach the car outside his garage but it often trips and shuts down in hot dewy or rainy weather. So often the car is pulled halfway into the garage where his charger is located because General Motors warns owners not to park the cars inside.

“Above all it’s scary” Dougherty said.

In the 14 fires GM has confirmed in Chevrolet Bolts almost all occurred during charging or when the batteries were fully charged. Customers who drained batteries to near zero and then recharged them fully could be at greater risk for fires than those who charge more frequently.

GM has committed to electric vehicles on the heels of its dramatic November 2020 announcement that it plans to offer 30 new EV models globally by 2025 with two-thirds available in North America.

The company took an $800 million charge for the first recalls in the April to June period of 2021 and now anticipates paying $2 billion for the recalls and buybacks. Battery maker LG has agreed to cover $1.9 billion of that according to GM.

Corporate spokesperson Daniel Flores addressed customers’ worries in an interview with The Inquirer:

“Both companies understand the urgency of what’s being worked on” he said. “Most importantly we understand — there are 140000-plus customers who are waiting very patiently for their recall repairs to begin. We can appreciate the concern. We have and will continue to apologize to our Bolt customers for this obvious inconvenience.”

Now after the production hiatus General Motors has assured the public that the problem is simply a manufacturing defect — a torn anode tab and folded separator in the same battery cell.

The 2017 to 2019 Bolts will receive completely new batteries. The company is developing software for 2020 to 2022 models that will diagnose defective cells.

Buybacks are being handled on a case-by-case basis Flores said.

Dozens of lawsuits have commenced against the carmaker from around the country but filed in Michigan the site of GM’s headquarters.

Ben Johns partner at the law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner Donaldson-Smith in Haverford said his firm represents owners from across the region.

Johns said the case has been frustrating for Bolt owners. He said the firm is working with other lawyers and expanding the cases to include the August recall because even owners who haven’t suffered fires still face a range of anxiety issues and a “significant devaluation of the vehicle.”

“If consumers were aware of this problem had it been disclosed to them by General Motors most of them wouldn’t have bought this car in the first place” Johns said.

Why car batteries get hot

The automotive industry is under tremendous pressure to increase driving distances in electric cars said Yury Gogotsi a Drexel University engineering professor and an expert on lithium batteries because consumers have been conditioned to travel at least 200 miles on a single tank in gasoline-powered vehicles.

“The more energy stored in a battery the more dangerous it becomes” Gogotsi said. “You have the amount of energy per unit of weight like a hand grenade stored in a battery.”

Lithium-ion batteries might look innocuous just sealed metal boxes that don’t normally give off an odor and slosh when shaken. But they’re composed of graphite metals and other materials bathed in liquid electrolytes that are flammable “like a paint thinner” Gogotsi said.

Gogotsi’s research shows nanomaterials — engineering on a tiny (nano) scale which has applications in many industries — would provide much faster charging and more stability for batteries and reduce risk associated with liquid electrolytes. Zinc is a common and inexpensive element being studied for this application Gogotsi said.

Other alternatives addressing the safety risk include solid batteries — all solid no liquid — or batteries that contain lithium-iron phosphate.

Still neither would provide the range and quick recharge that lithium-ion offers.

“Vehicle fires aren’t anything new; with gasoline engines we have car fires all the time” said Josh Lamb a researcher for Sandia a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory in Albuquerque N.M. “The only difference is we have a century of experience with internal combustion engines and working with gasoline.”

Lamb has been taking batteries to extreme ends during a decade of tenure with the government contractor — “We basically start fires and nobody gets mad at us when we do” — and he concludes that part of the trouble with lithium-ion batteries is their comparatively short real-world use time of about 10 years or so.

He’s confident in the fail-safes that have been designed into charging ports and the systems in electric vehicles themselves.

But it’s still worth noting that while a battery is charging it is vulnerable to stress. Gasoline-powered car owners would never dare refuel a vehicle in their garages while they slept even if the systems had been in place to make that a reality.

Still eager to get an electric car

Still despite fire concerns lawsuits and buyback offers not everyone is ready to give up on their Bolt.

Ray Ianuzzelli is a mechanical engineer who has had his Bolt for just a little over three years. After getting what he called a very generous offer from General Motors to buy back the vehicle — sticker price minus 10% — he decided to stick with his car.

And he’s not concerned about the charging process.

“When you’re charging especially in the summertime I could feel the heat from the process” Ianuzzelli said. “I used to work for a lithium battery company and I realize there’s a lot of heat generated in that process. The Bolt has the liquid cooling system so it’s keeping the batteries cool but in the process it’s got to eject that heat somewhere and it goes into the garage. That’s not a concern for me.”

The 75-year-old Boothwyn resident is mainly disappointed that he can no longer charge the Bolt in his garage because he likes to keep his vehicles looking new.

Ianuzzelli believes General Motors has not handled the Bolt recalls well. He has a friend with a Hyundai Kona EV and thought that company communicated with its customers more efficiently than GM.

Michele Mueller of Hillsborough N.J. loves her oasis blue 2020 Bolt and just celebrated a year anniversary with it. She likes that the little EV packs enough inside to easily move her traveling theater teaching program from school to school and never have to stop for gas.

But now she’s looking into a buyback.

Not only does Mueller 48 want to be able to charge overnight without worry but her line of work has also made her extra cautious.

“I park it at elementary schools” Mueller said. “For me the risk is too great of something going terribly wrong.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEvMTEvMDEvZWFybi1uMDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Three automakers release earnings reports for third quarter of 2021,"Last week the “Big Three” US automakers General Motors Ford and Stellantis issued their financial reports for the third quarter. Earnings across the board dropped year over year though some did beat analysts’ expectations pointing to the major impacts that the labor shortage and disruption to global supply chains continue to have on the automotive industry worldwide.

GM recorded gross profits of $3.79 billion for the third quarter ending on September 30 with total revenues of $26.78 billion for the quarter. Profits have dropped 40 percent year over year according to the Detroit Free Press. GM’s revenues while still enormous reflect a 25 percent drop from the third quarter of the previous year. Despite this GM’s third quarter earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations.

General Motors’ stock rose to $54.43 at the close of markets on Friday inching up to its 10-year high of $59.31 in June 2021. This is up from the 10-year low of $22.29 from the near collapse of the stock market in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic before the passage of the multitrillion-dollar CARES Act bailout.

Ford’s earnings per share was 51 cents in the third quarter nearly double analysts’ expectations of 27 cents. Ford’s stock jumped after the news to $17.08 Friday its highest level since 2014. Auto revenue also slightly beat expectations at $33.21 billion compared to an expected $32.54 billion.

However Ford’s revenue is still 5 percent below the level from the third quarter of 2020 and pretax adjusted earnings were $3 billion last quarter compared to $3.6 billion last year. Still Ford announced Wednesday that beginning in the fourth quarter it would reinstate its regular dividend which it had suspended beginning with the onset of the pandemic.

In its report Ford noted stronger sales for its Bronco SUV and Mustang Mach-E an electric vehicle. However Ford’s sales and market share for its Ford and Lincoln brands are at their lowest levels in 6 years according to Cox Automotive.

Stellantis the company formed out of a merger between US-Italian automaker Fiat Chrysler and French automaker PSA in January 2021 reported net revenues of $37.8 billion in the third quarter a 14 percent drop from what the two companies reported in revenues from the same quarter last year. It also reported 1.1 million vehicle shipments in the third quarter a 27 percent drop compared to last year according to the Detroit Free Press. The global semiconductor chip shortage caused planned production to drop up to 30 percent at Stellantis plants worldwide.

Richard Palmer Chief Financial Officer for Stellantis said in a press release last week that the corporation’s revenues “reflect the success of our recent vehicle launches including new electrified offerings combined with significant commercial and industrial actions executed by our teams in response to unfilled semiconductor orders.”

All major US automakers are investing more and more resources in electric vehicle (EV) production with the overall aim of cornering the market to compete with production from China and dominate the global market. Ford Stellantis and GM have all released electrified models over the past two years and last month Stellantis unveiled plans to set up four new EV platforms to support production of 2 million vehicles per year.

GM CEO Mary Barra told the New York Times that its joint battery venture with LG would start up production next year in Ohio. Ford CEO Jim Farley announced Wednesday that Ford planned to “simplify the technology” of its BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system delaying its rollout to the beginning of next year. His reason for the delay was that Ford needed to “catch up” to major EV competitors GM and Tesla according to CNBC.

Yet obstacles to electrification efforts exist in the ongoing microchip shortages and disruption to global supply chains themselves the economic consequences of the subordination of pandemic policies on the part of capitalist governments to private profit. But it is the working class who have been made to pay for disruptions to production in the form of wage and job cuts speedup longer workdays and more dangerous conditions.

All of the Big Three automakers have alternated shutting down and ramping up production since the global supply shortage began. It is notable that most production shutdowns were due not to the spread of COVID-19 which has killed dozens of autoworkers in the US alone but due to a shortage of irreplaceable parts.

In a UAW memo circulated at the Stellantis Belvidere Assembly Plant in Belvidere Illinois which builds Jeep models workers were told that they must work 60 hours per week through the end of this year. The plant has operated off and on since February 2021 and has laid off two shifts leaving the plant operating with one shift only. When workers have been laid off many have struggled to collect unemployment benefits from the state and have found no better recourse through the United Auto Workers.

Workers at several other plants worldwide have experienced similar patterns of production shutdowns and layoffs followed by brutal levels of forced overtime. Stellantis announced in October that it would lay off 1800 workers at its Windsor Ontario plant in Canada where it had rotated shutdowns due to the chip shortage earlier this year. In India Ford has plans to shut down all of its car-making operations in the country leaving 4000 workers and their families in the dust. Meanwhile Sterling Heights Assembly Plant near Detroit has been placed on “critical status” until the Christmas holiday with workers liable to work seven days a week for 90 consecutive days.

All of the major US carmakers expect the chip shortage to affect production and financial gains well into 2022 with Ford predicting that it could affect its production through the beginning of 2023 according to CNBC. Notably GM Ford and Stellantis all pointed to rising car prices as an earnings driver in the face of production stoppages. In the US the Consumer Price Index which measures inflation of consumer goods has stood at over 5 percent since at least July.

Companies are doing whatever they can to increase supply to make up for shortages. But perhaps the most important issue confronting auto executives is fear of opposition from the working class such as that which forced a shutdown of global Big Three operations in March 2020. More than 10000 workers at John Deere agricultural and construction equipment manufacturing plants in the US are currently on strike part of a broader push by workers in the US and around the world to demand wage increases that keep pace with inflation better working hours and safer working conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndia28uY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMzEvZ20taGFsdHMtc2Vjb25kLXNoaWZ0LWNvcnZldHRlLXBsYW50LWtlbnR1Y2t5L9IBXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndia28uY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMzEvZ20taGFsdHMtc2Vjb25kLXNoaWZ0LWNvcnZldHRlLXBsYW50LWtlbnR1Y2t5Lz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM halts second shift at Corvette plant in Kentucky,"BOWLING GREEN Ky. (AP) - General Motors has temporarily halted second-shift production at the Corvette Assembly Plant in Bowling Green.

The plant had avoided the layoffs and shutdowns affecting many automakers in recent weeks.

GM spokesman David Barnas confirmed the Corvette plant began running only a single shift on Oct. 25.

Barnas said the issue was not due to the global semiconductor chip issue.

The two-shift operation has been in place periodically since 2020 but pandemic restrictions and issues getting transmissions and other parts have hindered production at times.

GMC is embarking on an exciting period with the all-electric Hummer EV and hot on the heels of unveiling the 2021 Sierra 1500 an intriguing rendering of an aggressive pickup from the brand has been released.

This image was shared to Instagram by GM Design and was created by Nathan Zabarsky who has served as a creative designer for General Motors since mid-2017. While the rendering doesn’t depict a specific GMC model that is heading to the production line any time soon it is still pretty cool.

The pickup immediately stands out thanks to the aggressive upright front fascia that includes large L-shaped headlights. The lack of a traditional grille suggests that the truck would have an all-electric powertrain which it also sports large GMC branding. The truck also has a rugged front bumper with tow hooks.

While only a single sketch of the truck was released we can see that it also sports squared wheel arches finished in black and sits on a set of wheels with black and silver spokes. A pair of slim wing mirrors are also visible.

While the GMC Hummer EV is the sole electric pickup launched by GM recently it will soon be joined by a number of other electric trucks including a Silverado EV and a GMC Sierra EV.

Limited details about the forthcoming GMC Sierra EV are known but we know that it will be a full-size pickup and won’t be as off-road-oriented as the Hummer EV."

Those who weren't cited a combination of inconvenience injection site pain and ""injection fatigue.""

These are just a few things HIV providers are learning as they begin what Chloe Orkin MD professor of HIV medicine at Queen Mary University of London United Kingdom called a paradigm shift to long-acting treatment which may soon include not just shots but rings implants and microarray patches.

""It's a paradigm shift and we are at the very beginning of this paradigm shift"" said Orkin commenting during the discussion session of the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) 2021 Annual Meeting. ""We're having to change our model and it's challenging.""

In the United States the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first long-acting injectable a combination of cabotegravir and rilpivirine (CAB/RIL; Cabenuva ViiV Healthcare) in January 2021. But it has been approved in Canada since March 2020 and available at Angel's clinic since November 2020. It's also available in Canada as an every-other-month shot. Injected into the buttocks the shot was found to be nonnferior to standard daily oral treatment in many studies including the ATLAS the ATLAS-2M — which tested the every-other-month approach — and FLAIR trials.

Angel's clinic was part of all three of those trials so his clinic has had 5 years' experience preparing for the change in workflow and the new approach the shots require.

Of the 21 people Angel has treated 11 were white Canadians nine were Black African and one was Indigenous Canadian with women making up a third of the participants. Median age was 51 years and all patients had had undetectable viral loads before beginning the regimen. (Studies of the drug's effectiveness in people who struggle to take daily pills are still ongoing.)

Most of those 21 patients had had undetectable viral loads for more than 5 years but a few had been undetectable for only 6 months before beginning the shots. Their immune systems were also healthy with a median CD4 count of 618 cells/µL. As in the clinical trials none of the participants had experienced antiretroviral treatment failure. Because public health insurers in Canada have yet to approve the shots Angel's patients receiving Cabenuva also have private health insurance. Up to 90% of people in Canada receive pharmaceutical coverage through public insurance; therefore the shot is not yet widely available.

Twenty patients switched from integrase inhibitor regimens and one had been receiving a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor–based regimen before starting Cabenuva.

And although the drug has not been approved for shot initiation this way two patients requested — and Angel agreed — to start them on the shots without first doing a month of daily pills to check for safety.

""This is my conclusion from these data: the oral lead-in period is not necessary"" Angel said in his presentation at the meeting. ""It can provide some comfort to either a physician or a patient but it does not seem to be medically necessary.""

That approach is not without data to back it up. Research presented at HIV Glasgow 2020 showed that people who switched from daily oral dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine straight to the injections did so without problems.

At last clinic visit 15 of those 21 were still receiving the shots. None have experienced treatment failure and all were still virally suppressed. Four participants left the trials and one more person opted to return to daily pills citing some level of what Angel called ""injection fatigue.""

""Just as we use the term 'pill fatigue' for patients who are tired of taking pills patients do get tired of coming in monthly for their visits and injections"" he said. They find the trip to the clinic for the intramuscular injections ""inconvenient"" he said.

Unlike in the United States where Cabenuva is approved for only monthly injections Health Canada has already approved the shot for every-other-month injections which Angel said may reduce the odds of injection fatigue.

Angel's presentation drew comments questions and excitement from the crowd. Annemarie Wensing MD assistant professor of medicine at University Medical Center Utrecht the Netherlands asked whether dispensing with the oral lead-in period could mean that these shots could be useful for people going on longer trips people having surgeries where they can't swallow pills or in other scenarios.

""These are not hypothetical conversations"" Angel said. ""I'm having these conversations with patients now — temporary use they travel for 3 months and come back can they go from injectable to oral to injectable.""

For now he said the answer is ""We'll figure it out.""

Meanwhile there's another big question when it comes to injectables said Marta Vasylyev MD from Lviv Regional AIDS Center in Ukraine: when will they be available to the people who might benefit most from them — people in resource-limited settings people who so far have struggled to remember to take their pills every day?

For now Angel replied injectables continue to be a treatment only for those who are already doing well while receiving HIV treatment: those with already suppressed viral load who are good at taking daily pills and who are being treated at well-resourced clinics.

""There are huge obstacles to overcome if this is ever to be available [in resource-limited settings] and way more obstacles than there are with any oral therapies"" he said. ""There's not been much discussion here about the necessity of cold-chain requirements of pharmacies either centrally or locally [or] the requirements of additional nurses or healthcare staff to administer the medication. So you're looking at a very resource-intensive therapy which now is fairly restrictive [as to] who will have access to it.""

Angel reports serving on advisory boards for ViiV Healthcare and Gilead Sciences and has done contract research for ViiV Healthcare Gilead and Merck. Orkin has received research grants fees as a consultant travel sponsorship and speaker fees from ViiV Merck and GlaxoSmithKline. Vasylyev reported no relevant financial relationships.

Quiñones-Sánchez knew before going into her mammogram that she had a small lump on her breast but because it wasn’t painful she put off the appointment. This was a decision she later regretted when a biopsy confirmed the cancer diagnosis.

In August Quiñones-Sánchez chose to have a mastectomy of her left breast in hopes of avoiding chemotherapy and radiation. But her doctor informed her that in order to prevent future illness the treatment plan would have to be more aggressive.

Despite the challenge Quiñones-Sánchez was determined to maintain her work schedule. Three days after having her breast removed she was in a Zoom meeting with staff.

Sending support and strength to my colleague @MariaQSanchez whose story will be sending me to my doctor for my own mammogram. Your courage and willpower is unbeatable! https://t.co/1Y6adhoM4W — Helen Gym (@HelenGymPHL) October 30 2021

Quiñones-Sánchez is currently in remission but is undergoing chemotherapy at Penn Medicine and is expected to begin preventive radiation in a few weeks.

In the op-ed Quiñones-Sánchez reflected on the blessing of living in Philadelphia where the medical care she received was high quality.

“My doctors tell me that by February this entire experience may be in the rearview mirror. I feel lucky that even though I put off my mammogram the cancer was caught early enough to be treated. I know this is not the case for everyone” she wrote.

At first Quiñones-Sánchez wanted to stay silent about her diagnosis until her treatment was complete in December. But when she got a short haircut — in preparation for the wig she would have to wear after losing her hair — people had a lot to say about it.

“If people had so many opinions about my hair what would they think of this? It scared me to expose something so personal about myself. Until recently the only people who knew were my husband mother children and sister-in-law” Quiñones-Sánchez wrote.

Throughout October which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month Quiñones-Sánchez heard from many women speaking about their journeys in fighting cancer.

She also thought about the women she knew personally who have lost their battles with the disease including her sister-in-law and a family friend. This is ultimately what prompted her to share her story.

“I have always prided myself on being authentic and accessible. The more I listened to these other brave women talk the guiltier I felt about not being honest about my own experiences” Quiñones-Sánchez wrote.

Throughout her experience Quiñones-Sánchez had Black and Latina women in mind. While Black women are just as likely as white women to be diagnosed with breast cancer Black women are almost 40% more likely to die from the disease.

Additionally research published in the medical journal Cancer Control found that breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among U.S. Latinos and it is the top cause of cancer-related death in that community.

In her op-ed Quiñones-Sánchez encouraged Black and Latina women to use her story as inspiration to do breast self-exams and get regular mammograms.

Days after her mastectomy @MariaQSanchez was back to work. She didn’t tell her staff about her diagnosis until she started chemo. I can’t imagine the pressure of keeping this quiet for so long.

Visa’s technology is used by a growing list of issuers acquirers and fintechs.

A recent study conducted by Visa found that nearly half of all global consumers (42%) expressed interest in installment financing on their existing credit card or one they could apply for.

To help partners meet this demand Visa Installments Solution is being deployed globally to make BNPL options available in-store and across ecommerce platforms.

The network-based solution allows financial institutions to add BNPL as a customised feature for credit card holders on already approved credit lines while acquirers can enable installments for any retailers that accept Visa.

First launched as a pilot in 2019 the solution has expanded to Australia Canada Malaysia Russia and the US.

In Asia Pacific following the recent launch with HSBC Visa is rolling out installment programs with ANZ GHL Systems Malaysia and Quest Payment Systems.

Visa is also working with Cybersource FIS Global Payments and TSYS a Global Payments company in several markets across the globe to enable the Visa Installments Solution.

Visa working closely with Klarna on buy now pay later

Visa already supports leading BNPL fintechs including Afterpay ChargeAfter SplitIt and Klarna.

Recently Visa announced that Klarna has signed a global deal with Visa to accelerate its expansion and scale in several markets.

“For years Visa has been enthusiastically embracing BNPL for the same reason we pioneered revolving credit debit and prepaid decades ago: because it expands choice and convenience for buyers and sellers alike” said Mary Kay Bowman SVP and global head of payment and platform products Visa.

“If shoppers prefer a BNPL fintech solution we are here and enabling it; if they want an option from their banks we’re helping offer those too.”

“At HSBC we strive to bring new and innovative solutions to our customers. We are excited to partner with Visa and be the first bank outside North America to launch the Visa Installments Solution starting in Malaysia; announcing our entrance in the digital Buy Now Pay Later space” said Madhu Kejriwal Group Head Unsecured Lending & Partnerships HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking.

“This feature facilitates point of sale purchases for HSBC Visa credit card customers when they shop with partner merchants by allowing them to split payments into monthly instalments at no additional cost and no credit application. We look forward to continuing to innovate with Visa including delivering on our global BNPL strategy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjEvb2N0LzMxL3dlc3QtY2xpbWF0ZS1jcmlzaXMtY29wMjYtYWZyaWNhLWRldmVsb3AtZ2xvYmFsLWhlYXRpbmfSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIxL29jdC8zMS93ZXN0LWNsaW1hdGUtY3Jpc2lzLWNvcDI2LWFmcmljYS1kZXZlbG9wLWdsb2JhbC1oZWF0aW5n?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The west caused the climate crisis – it should now pay to clean up the mess,"When will rich countries take responsibility? Last week ahead of Cop26 in Glasgow it was revealed that many of them had lobbied against the UN’s climate recommendations – namely that urgent action is needed. At the same time some questioned the need to fund poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change – despite the failure by developed countries to deliver the $100bn (£75bn) they had pledged.

Africa has done little to create the climate crisis. Yet the locust plagues in the Horn of Africa the first climate change famine in Madagascar and the water crises in southern Africa are all evidence that my continent is already paying the price of others’ emissions. The fund that some would like diminished is not charity but a cleaning fee that must be paid.

To compound this wealthy countries are also imposing energy transition on Africa that risks doing great harm. Several governments and multilateral lending institutions are banning funding for fossil-fuel infrastructure – and encouraging others to follow suit. This may sound logical on paper but it rules out transitioning through natural gas the cleanest fossil fuel. And in practice it only applies to poor countries while richer countries face few bans on developing or importing gas.

Africans have a right to electricity. But renewables cannot yet fully service their needs and aspirations. Storage technologies are not advanced enough to make solar wind and other intermittent energy sources dependable. Access to electricity – one of the UN’s sustainable development goals – means more than charging a phone through a solar panel. It is about the on-demand sustained and intensive energy needed to power industrialisation build infrastructure create jobs and ultimately lift citizens from poverty.

Africa is the world’s least electrified continent and almost 600 million people lack reliable access. If excluding South Africa sub-Saharan electricity consumption tripled overnight powered by natural gas global emissions would rise by only 0.62%.

In addition to powering manufacturing gas would also underwrite agricultural development and food security. Energy-intensive irrigation systems will be needed to modernise farms. So too will synthetic fertiliser the most efficient feedstock of which is natural gas. As droughts and crop failure become more common both will be in ever greater demand to keep the continent fed.

Dealing with climate change means also dealing with its consequences. Efficient transport infrastructure food security and reliable energy grids are all needed to mitigate against natural disasters such as droughts and flooding. The more developed a country the more resilient. And if clean natural gas replaces charcoal and other poisonous biomasses for indoor cooking hundreds of thousands of lives mostly those of women and children will be saved across the continent.

Currently the favoured energy unit across the continent is the diesel-powered generator. Unless a reliable alternative is offered this dirtier practice will persist – because a choice between no energy or dirty energy is no choice for individuals and businesses in the developing world.

Importantly tapping gas resources does not preclude renewables in Africa’s energy mix. The continent already draws much from such sources. Malawi for instance gets more than 80% of its electricity from hydropower.

A more nuanced approach is needed if climate equity and justice are to be respected. When the concepts were written into the 2015 Paris accord to combat climate change it meant two things. First countries that had become rich through hydrocarbons had a duty to cut emissions faster to allow poorer countries to develop. Second those same countries had a responsibility to help undeveloped countries adapt to the adverse conditions they did not create. The impacts of the climate crisis are inherently unfair. They are spread unevenly across the globe with Africa the continent most at risk.

To strike a global deal in Paris these different rights and responsibilities duties and obligations had to be weighed debated and then ratified. But blanket gas bans for the developing world show the west has forgotten the first principle. Repeated failure to mobilise the promised billions in climate aid shows that it has ignored the second – not just an act of dishonour but of betrayal as well.

If countries with the greatest capacity to effect change do not those with more modest means should not be expected to do so. At Cop26 the west must show that it is now fit for the challenge and will finally fulfil its obligations. Only then will equity and justice become more than a mere slogan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL29jdC8zMC9zaGVsbC1hbmQtYnAtcGFpZC16ZXJvLXRheC1vbi1ub3J0aC1zZWEtZ2FzLWFuZC1vaWwtZm9yLXRocmVlLXllYXJz0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvb2N0LzMwL3NoZWxsLWFuZC1icC1wYWlkLXplcm8tdGF4LW9uLW5vcnRoLXNlYS1nYXMtYW5kLW9pbC1mb3ItdGhyZWUteWVhcnM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shell and BP paid zero tax on North Sea gas and oil for three years,"Shell and BP which together produce more than 1.7bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year have not paid any corporation tax on oil and gas production in the North Sea for the last three years company filings reveal.

The oil giants which have an annual global footprint of greenhouse gases more than five times bigger than Britain’s are benefiting from billions of pounds of tax breaks and reliefs for oil and gas production.

Shell and BP paid no corporation tax or production levies on North Sea oil operations between 2018 and 2020 and claimed tax reliefs of nearly £400m according to annual “payments to governments” reports analysed by the Observer.

Over the same three-year period they paid shareholders more than £44bn in dividends.

A petroleum revenue tax of 35% was effectively scrapped by the then chancellor George Osborne in 2016 and oil giants can claim billions of pounds in taxpayer handouts for decommissioning rigs.

The North Sea is now one of the most profitable areas in the world for oil and gas production after tax cuts by the government to encourage production.

Shell and BP have set targets to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by investing in cleaner energy but say the UK will continue to need oil and gas from the North Sea which also supports thousands of jobs.

Climate campaigners are now challenging the UK tax regime in a high court case. They want the payouts to be scrapped and a ban on any new oil and gas projects in the North Sea to help cut carbon emissions.

Philip Evans oil and gas campaigner for Greenpeace UK said: “It’s outrageous that as the UK prepares to host global climate talks in Glasgow we still have one of the lowest effective tax rates in the world for oil extraction.

We’re giving tax breaks worth billions of pounds to companies that have been fuelling the climate emergency for decades.”

There are about 180 oil rigs in the North Sea and the sector has generated about £360bn in net tax revenues since 1970 which is about £7.2bn a year.

The UK has some of the lowest oil tax rates in the world. An analysis by research company Rystad Energy in January found the UK is now the most profitable country in the world for the development of oil and gas “mega-projects”.

Taxpayers will foot a bill of more than £18bn for the decommissioning of the oil and gas infrastructure in the North Sea up to 2065 – made up of tax repayments and a reduction in offshore corporation tax. Campaigners want the handouts to be scrapped and used for investing in clean energy.

Kwasi Kwarteng the business secretary faces a legal challenge over the tax handout to oil and gas operators by campaigners. Paid to Pollute a group of environmental organisations says that the taxpayer handouts to oil and gas companies are unlawful because they conflict with the UK’s legal duty to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. A judicial review is due to be heard before the end of the year.

Gabrielle Jeliazkov a campaigner at Platform a UK group that investigates the social and environmental effects of the global oil industry and is supporting the legal case said: “The government has spent too long backing oil giants through tax breaks and subsidies. It has had devastating consequences for the climate.”

Shell and BP also face strong opposition over new projects in the North Sea. A report published last week by Friends of the Earth and the New Economics Foundation found that the oil and gas industry is preparing to seek approval for 30 offshore projects by 2025.

Shell has defended plans for the Cambo project a controversial oilfield off Shetland that contains about 800m barrels of oil and is awaiting approval from the Oil and Gas Authority a government licensing body. Greenpeace lost a legal bid this month for the government to revoke the permit for BP to drill at the Vorlich oilfield in the North Sea which started production in November last year.

It was reported by Reuters last week that Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning had rejected Shell’s plans to develop the Jackdaw gasfield in the North Sea after considering its environmental statement.A Shell spokesperson said: “Our total oil production already peaked in 2019 and we expect it to continue declining including through divestments. We’re already investing billions of dollars in low-carbon energy. The North Sea Transition Deal agreed earlier this year also maps out how the sector will reduce emissions in line with the government’s net zero targets.” The company said it paid no corporation tax on North Sea production last year because of tax losses in previous years.

A BP spokesperson said: “All BP’s North Sea assets are owned by companies that are subject to UK tax in accordance with UK law. Over the years BP has contributed over £40bn in taxes to the UK government from its North Sea business.

“In recent years in line with longstanding UK tax regulations tax relief on the significant investments we have recently made in the North Sea business and the challenging price environment including the steep oil price falls in 2015 and 2020 have meant we have paid no North Sea corporate taxes.”

A government spokesperson said: “The UK oil and gas industry has paid around £375bn in production taxes to date – with companies in the North Sea subject to headline rates that are more than double those paid by other businesses. Relief for decommissioning costs is a fundamental part of the UK’s tax system.”",,,,,,

And new laws could make accountability even scarcer.

Switch to light mode TULSA Okla. — On May 31 2020 six days after the murder of George Floyd a welding inspector named Thomas Ryan Knight went to his first protest a Black Lives Matter demonstration. It was hot but clear as he and his girlfriend joined the crowd which marched through a part of the city that was the site of a racist massacre a century ago and followed it onto Interstate-244 West grinding traffic in all three lanes to a halt on the overpass of a highway that long ago cleaved this historic Black neighborhood in two. In Harm’s Way The car becomes the weapon Demonstrators around the country have been injured and killed by vehicle rammings but there’s been precious little justice. And new laws could make accountability even scarcer. A grisly blueprint of terror Charlottesville car attack four years ago foreshadowed a summer of violence in 2020. Putting the law on the driver’s side In Iowa and elsewhere Republicans push bills granting some legal immunity to motorists who hit protesters. A nationwide threat Explore the data behind 16 months of car rammings across the United States. Pictured above: A protester stood in front of a pickup truck hauling a trailer. Protesters blocked I-244 westbound during a protest of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and a commemoration of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre in 2020. (Mike Simons/Tulsa World/file) Knight a wry father of five who goes by Ryan and has the seal of the Choctaw nation tattooed on his right wrist wanted to show his support for Black Americans to be one more body in the sea of millions taking to the streets across the country to protest racism and police brutality. But once he got up to the highway Knight didn’t feel comfortable decided it was time to go and made his way toward the shoulder. That’s where his memory ends. While the drivers of the stopped vehicles seethed over the demonstration a red pickup truck with a hulking empty horse trailer pushed into the crowd as its driver placed a handgun on the dashboard witnesses said and protesters banged on its hood and threw things at the vehicle as it moved in. Knight can’t remember the screams the crush of people how it separated him from his girlfriend and how in the chaos he was propelled over the highway’s edge falling onto the grass below. What Knight remembers is his time in the hospital and how at first he couldn’t swallow or breathe on his own or move his fingers. He remembers learning his spinal cord was damaged that he could not walk. “As soon as I woke up I was like man am I paralyzed?” said Knight 34. “It was devastating.” The episode left Knight in a wheelchair and cost him his job. But to Oklahoma prosecutors neither he nor the handful of others who were injured in the chaos are victims of a crime. That July while Knight was still at a rehabilitation center in Colorado the local district attorney announced no charges would be filed against the driver whose identity was kept secret saying that the man was scared for his family in the vehicle and acted in self-defense and that protesters had unnecessarily blocked the road. Ryan Knight fell from an overpass on Interstate 244 in Tulsa Okla. after a truck drove through the group he was protesting with last year. The fall damaged his spinal cord. (Chris Creese for The Boston Globe) It lent the full weight of the law to the idea that the carnage on the highway was the fault of the protesters who stood there and not the driver who plowed through them. Nine months later the state legislature passed a law granting drivers criminal and civil immunity if they “unintentionally” hit or kill a protester while “fleeing from a riot” so long as they say it was necessary to protect themselves citing the protest on I-244 as the catalyst for the law. You read that right. Given the choice between defending the safety of pedestrians protesting a police murder and the drivers of the vehicles running them down prosecutors and lawmakers here have reserved their concern for the drivers. To those on the short end of this cold calculus it feels like siding during the 1960s civil rights protests with Bull Connor’s firehoses over the Black children of Birmingham. Or with the cops with clubs over the brave battered souls who traversed Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge. A Globe review of the recent incidents found there have been scores of people hit dozens of injuries at least three deaths but precious little justice much less sympathy for the demonstrators injured killed or just plain terrified. Yet Oklahoma and 15 other states have considered bills protecting drivers not protesters as these ramming incidents have proliferated. The arc of history is bending but it is fair to ask: Which way? “They pick and choose who the law protects” Knight said as he sat in his living room decorated with family photos and blue calla lilies on the wall one day this summer. It is difficult for him to view the authorities’ response to his plight as anything other than a cover-up enacted in broad daylight. “I just don’t want what happened to me to happen to anybody else regardless of what they believe in” Knight said. But around the country in big cities and small towns on rotaries and one-lane roads highways and crosswalks it already has. Vehicle ramming. It is the term researchers use to describe incidents in which a car truck or motorcycle is turned by its driver into a weapon against people on the street. It is a phenomenon they had witnessed over the years through much of the world. But last year a peculiarly American variation of this practice became increasingly common one in which demonstrations — especially the groundswell of antiracism protests spurred by Floyd’s killing — were the target. The numbers alone make it stunning that more national notice hasn’t been given to this violent trend. Between Floyd’s death on May 25 2020 and Sept. 30 2021 vehicles drove into protests at least 139 times according to an analysis completed by The Boston Globe relying on researchers’ data local news coverage and the Globe’s own findings. In addition to the three deaths vehicle rammings at protests have injured at least 100 people the Globe found yet in most cases the driver has gone unpunished: The Globe confirmed the existence of charges in just 65 of the cases — fewer than half of them — and found only four so far in which a driver was convicted of a felony. This dataset includes incidents in which protesters were hit or narrowly missed by an oncoming vehicle. While it is likely the most comprehensive review of a problem that is not centrally tracked by the authorities it may well be incomplete. Reliable information about arrests and criminal proceedings was not always available and there may be additional rammings not reflected in the Globe’s list. The Globe drew from research on rammings at demonstrations by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project a nonprofit research organization that tracks political violence and the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University to create its tally adding some cases and leaving out those which the Globe could not confirm or which did not fit its investigative criteria.

6 Death involved Filter by All incidents Driver not charged Driver charged Driver convicted A nationwide threat An analysis by The Boston Globe found at least 139 ramming incidents since the last week of May last year many of which occurred during the height of protests over the killing of George Floyd last summer. Ten rammings in the Los Angeles area In the area of Southern California in and around Los Angeles there were 10 instances of vehicle rammings against protesters six during the last week of May and first week of June last year alone. Thirteen injured in New York New York City experienced eight rammings against protesters including one in December of last year in Manhattan where six Black Lives Matter protesters supporting ICE detainees were injured. The driver was charged with three misdemeanors. Not just a big-city problem Rammings were not limited to protests in the nation’s largest cities though. Cities such as Madison Wis. Tulsa Okla. Akron Ohio and Richmond Va. all saw multiple rammings over the last 16 months including two separate incidents at the same Robert E. Lee memorial in Virginia's capital. Three states pass laws to protect drivers Florida where 10 incidents took place is one of three states that enacted laws this year giving drivers some degree of legal immunity if they use their vehicles to hurt protesters joining Iowa and Oklahoma. At least 100 injured The Globe found at least 100 people were injured in the 139 incidents of ramming examined. The injuries ranged from minor bruises and scrapes to broken vertebrae that left one protester paralyzed from the chest down. Four protesters killed In Bakersfield Calif. Seattle and Minneapolis protesters were killed when cars hit them. A fourth protester was killed in Austin after an Army sergeant drove into a demonstration and then shot a protester who aimed a gun at his car. Less than half of drivers charged The Globe was able to confirm that drivers were charged in 65 ramming incidents or just over 46 percent of the 139 rammings analyzed. Of the drivers to face charges just over half of them were charged with a felony. No consequences for some The Globe confirmed that drivers did not face charges in 38 percent of cases.

The fear among those who study this data is that such incidents are going to keep happening especially if the protest wave resumes. “You’re going to have people coming in and expressing themselves with two tons of metal on wheels” said Brian Michael Jenkins the director of the National Transportation Security Center at Mineta. “That’s part of the landscape now.” Vehicle rammings have drawn the most attention when in Europe the Middle East and Africa terrorists affiliated with such groups as the Islamic State have used cars and trucks to turn Christmas markets street corners and even the beach into theaters of carnage to further their extremist message. In the United States they have manifested as attacks on houses of worship a shopping mall random pedestrians and a women’s clinic including the 2017 ramming in New York City that killed eight people which experts viewed as terrorism. The rammings of demonstrations in the United States have been far less deadly overall and often appear unplanned motivated in different cases by ideology racial hatred rage at being inconvenienced by a traffic jam and in some cases a driver’s fear of finding themselves surrounded by protesters. The Center for Strategic and International Studies a Washington-based think tank considers nine of the domestic ramming cases in which protesters were targeted to be acts of terrorism. “It’s quite unique seeing people using cars as a weapon to suppress demonstrators” said Roudabeh Kishi the director of research and innovation at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project. “Most incidents that we’ve seen have all been targeting peaceful protesters. … It’s really going against the narrative that these types of incidents are self-defense.”

The rise of vehicle violence against protesters has emerged in a country that is wracked by bitter divisions over race and policing with many states giving wide legal latitude to those who turn to violence as a form of self-defense. These incidents are often tied to race since they frequently happened at antiracism protests; in the cases in which the drivers’ race was known they were four times more likely to be white than a person of color. Sometimes witnesses describe obvious racism by drivers who use racial slurs or phrases such as “white lives matter” as they charge forward. One driver was an avowed member of the Ku Klux Klan. Not all of the cases are clear cut and some of the car rammings examined for this story were likely unintentional as when drivers moved slowly through a demonstration in their way instead of going around it and protesters flocked toward them or jumped on the hood. But in other cases “the driver is intending to intimidate and coerce people from exercising their First Amendment rights” said Mary McCord the executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who is an expert on domestic terrorism. “That’s just another way that protests have become more dangerous.” The rammings have left lasting scars physical and emotional on the protesters who have experienced them. The 100 injuries the Globe counted include concussions and broken bones and are almost certainly an undercount as many protesters who were hit declined to speak to police. These rammings can also be fatal: Three protesters were killed when vehicles hit them while a fourth died in Austin after an Army sergeant drove into a demonstration and then shot a protester who his lawyer said aimed a gun at his car. The sergeant may have acted in self-defense but only after driving into a crowd. Over a year of injury and death A Boston Globe analysis found that from May 25 2020 to Sept. 30 2021 more than 100 people were injured or killed by individuals who drove vehicles into protests including more than 60 in five weeks from the end of May through June last year. Death 2020 injuries and deaths May 26 Jun 36 Jul 8 Aug 2 Sep 12 Oct 3 Nov 2 Dec 6 2021 injuries and deaths Jan 0 Feb 1 Mar 0 Apr 0 May 5 Jun 2 Jul 1 Aug 0 The incidents span the nation affecting red and blue states alike. It has happened in Newton when a white man who heckled a young demonstrator with his cries about “unborn Black babies” later sped his truck close to the crowd. It has happened in Bakersfield Calif. when a white man whom local media described as having a neo-Nazi tattoo hit a Black man Robert Forbes with his Acura and killed him. It happened in Daytona Beach Fla. when a white woman drove over the foot of Dyrell Johnson a Black organizer during a peaceful even joyful protest the same day Knight was paralyzed. “She looked at me looked directly in my eye directly in my face and started laughing” Johnson said in an interview. Three of his toes are still numb; he keeps them constantly bandaged and has changed his gait to avoid letting them touch the ground. “That ruined so much” Johnson said. The woman was not identified by the authorities. Yet as alarming as these incidents are to experts in political violence they have not always triggered aggressive prosecution by law enforcement. The woman who hit Johnson was never charged with a crime. Neither was the man who killed Forbes. And the driver in Newton faced only a misdemeanor charge. Of the 65 drivers the Globe confirmed were charged in ramming incidents just 34 faced felonies while the others were charged with misdemeanors or lesser offenses like traffic violations. Through months of inquiries by the Globe some of its requests to authorities were repeatedly ignored making it impossible to say exactly how many cases yielded criminal charges or did not. Caitlin Healy/Globe Staff In their words Dyrell Johnson Daytona Beach Florida Dyrell Johnson is a community organizer in Daytona Beach whose foot was run over by a car driven by a woman through a George Floyd protest in May 2020. Police said the driver was not identified and no charges were filed. But it is clear that many drivers who injured people never faced a felony charge. In some cases it was the protester who was hit not the driver who was charged for disorderly conduct or jaywalking. For many drivers including the one in Tulsa a self-defense argument carried the day. When protesters threw items or banged on vehicles some drivers accelerated into the crowd and drove away later saying they were afraid. In many cases police and prosecutors simply accepted drivers’ explanations that they were not attempting to instill terror in pedestrian protesters but rather felt terror themselves. In Visalia Calif. an open-topped Jeep flying an American flag and what appeared to be a Trump flag hit two protesters on May 30 2020 during an encounter caught on video in which water bottles were thrown at the car. The local prosecutor said the driver was acting out of fear for his safety and did not charge him. In Gainesville Fla. prosecutors dropped six counts of aggravated assault against a man who drove through a protest on that same day saying the state’s Stand Your Ground law which allows someone in a confrontation to defend themselves in their own residence without any duty to retreat had come into play. Sometimes a grand jury refused to indict drivers despite prosecutors’ efforts; that happened for example after a Black man was hit by a car at a children’s protest in Eugene Ore. in June of 2020. The grand jury declined a slate of charges including attempted murder; the driver got low-level citations instead. So far only four drivers have actually been convicted of felonies according to the Globe’s analysis although that number is likely to rise as more cases wind their way through the pandemic-backlogged courts (two drivers charged with felonies died before their cases were resolved). Nineteen drivers were convicted of misdemeanors or lower offenses and six were given alternative sentences involving court diversion programs. But the rate of charging and conviction which has not previously been analyzed or reported raises questions about whether prosecutors are taking these cases seriously. A lack of consequences Nearly 40 percent of drivers who rammed protesters with their vehicle from May 25 2020 to Sept. 30 2021 were not charged in any way. All incidents (139) Globe found no evidence of charges for driver 38.1% Felony charges 24.5% Misdemeanor/Lesser charges 21.6% Incidents involving injuries or fatalities (72) Globe found no evidence of charges for driver 36.1% Felony charges 33.3% Misdemeanor/Lesser charges 19.4% Mia Bloom a professor at Georgia State University who studies global terrorism and has written about vehicle rammings in the United States said the rate of convictions for serious crimes appears to be low. “When we’re looking at a tactic” Bloom said “you take your car and you plow it into civilians on purpose in order to terrify them for a political purpose what’s the difference between plowing your car and planting a bomb?” One day before the protest in Tulsa a college student named Carmyn Taylor joined a group of demonstrators in blocking another highway in the city Interstate 44. There she said a vehicle sped through the protesters clipping her backpack and turning her in the air. Lucky not to be badly hurt she wound up in the hospital with a bruise on the back of her left thigh. While she was there an officer with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol came to speak with her she said but his questions were so “aggressive” she asked him if she — not the driver — was going to be charged. “All he said was ‘You might’” Taylor recalled. Undeterred Taylor texted with a friend of hers Kenyari Porter about their plans for another protest the next day. Porter’s mother a nurse was going to attend to provide medical help if anyone needed it. Taylor was going to bring safety glasses and gloves in case of tear gas and extra water. She texted Porter a picture of her sign the words written in white on black poster board: “Your truck won’t stop justice.” “I’ll try to be in the front in case stuff goes south” Taylor texted. “White bodies should protect black lives.” Carmyn Taylor a student of Northeastern State University was injured in May 2020 when a driver sped through a group of protesters in Tulsa clipping Taylor with the car. (Chris Creese for The Boston Globe) When a group of protesters made their way up to the overpass Taylor was right there. So was Mike Simons a longtime photographer for the Tulsa World. The protest started with a small group who darted onto the asphalt during breaks between cars; once traffic started stopping he said more people joined the protesters. “It was tense at first then it just kind of calmed down” said Simons. The traffic had ground to a halt so still that the driver of a box truck set up a folding chair near its opened back door as if he were going to recline there. Taylor remembers the camaraderie among the protesters the cheers of a group that had found a way to be heard. She was there as the crowd parted to let a Black woman wearing scrubs through with her car — and when the red truck with the horse trailer began inching up even as the crowd re-formed to stop it from passing. “I watched him put something that to me at the time looked like a TV remote … on the dash” Taylor said. It was actually a gun witnesses said. It was the moment the photographer Simons said when the tension ratcheted up. “That’s what inflamed people” Simons said. As the driver moved through the crowd protesters began hitting the vehicle with their hands water bottles and other objects. Some grabbed the back of the trailer and a door handle of the truck something smoky was lobbed through the air— reactions the local prosecutor described as a violent and unprovoked attack on the truck. As the truck edged forward Taylor stood right in front of it her eerily prescient sign in the air. One video shows a Black man appearing to urge her to step aside but she didn’t. A bicycle unintentionally blocked Taylor’s ability to move away as the truck closed in she said. “You can see me banging on the hood of the truck and screaming stop because I can’t move” Taylor said referring to the video of the incident. “The front tire of the bike got pulled under the front tire of the truck. And then the back tire it pulled my legs. And that’s how I got ran over.” Left: Top: Demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd surrounded a truck that drove through them on Interstate 244 in Tulsa Okla. Right: Bottom: People attended Ryan Knight after he fell from an overpass when the truck drove through protesters. (Mike Simons/Tulsa World/file) One video shows Taylor and another person with their backs pressed to the truck’s grill as it moved forward the bike caught under the wheel next to Taylor. It didn’t hurt in the moment Taylor said but when she tried to stand up her leg clicked and she was in enormous pain. One bone on her right leg was broken she said; her left ankle was sprained. Simons who covered the Oklahoma City bombing riots and tornadoes said it was the most terrified he has ever been on assignment. “You look back and you see the giant trailer coming and you turn to run and there’s kind of nowhere to go” he said. “The sounds were terrible … anger and screaming and after it passed you heard people writhing.” Knight and Tearra King his girlfriend were farther away from the red truck she said as panicked people tried to escape. “We just got bombarded by the crowd” King said. “I tried to grab him to hold onto him and we just got separated.” “ You look back and you see the giant trailer coming and you turn to run and there’s kind of nowhere to go. The sounds were terrible … anger and screaming and after it passed you heard people writhing.” — Mike Simons Tulsa World photographer King started frantically looking for Knight. “My gut is telling me something was wrong because he would have come looking for me instead of me coming looking for him” she said. “I call his phone and some guy answered” King said. “He was like ‘Are you with the guy that has this phone? You might want to get down here.’” King didn’t know what the man meant. Down here? Where? She found Knight lying in the grass below the overpass surrounded by protesters trying to help him. Back up on the highway the driver of the red truck stopped to speak with law enforcement officers who helped him secure his trailer and then drove away. Before millions of Americans took to the streets following Floyd’s death in 2020 rammings directed at protests were rare here. A survey of global vehicle ramming incidents by Mineta for example found just three examples where protesters were targeted in the United States before 2020 including the fatal attack by James Alex Fields Jr. on antiracism demonstrators in Charlottesville Va. on Aug. 12 2017. From the end of May to the end of September 2020 alone their count of protest rammings they deemed malicious or possibly so skyrocketed to 43. Experts can’t say for sure why the numbers exploded in 2020 but they point to an array of possible reasons. First millions of people were protesting racism in the largest wave of demonstrations in the country in decades. At the same time conservative pundits and politicians portrayed the protesters as lawless rioters or “thugs” as President Trump called them stoking hostility toward them — and also for some perhaps exaggerated fear of them. Memes making light of mowing down protesters including one that read “All lives splatter” had been proliferating on right-wing message boards and on social media — a subject the Globe will explore in more detail later in this series. “I think about the fact that in May and June of last year we have this intense ... creation of fear about these peaceful demonstrations” said Shannon Hiller director of the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University. “That creates targets of opportunity and fear.” Jenkins of Mineta sees the rammings as an outgrowth of the larger spike in “aggressive antisocial behavior” in a deeply divided society. “Americans have a unique relationship to their vehicle” he said. “There is a trigger to anger if somebody touches that vehicle gets in the way of that vehicle cuts off that vehicle on the road.” Some drivers claimed they did not hit protesters for political reasons but simply believed they had the right to drive through them. In Troy Mich. Timothy Paul Maier 68 hit a white woman and a Black woman during a Black Lives Matter protest on June 2 2020. “Maier admitted he struck the pedestrians on purpose to move them out of the way” according to the police report. “Maier stated that race was not the issue but that he just thought since he had a green signal he could drive into a group of pedestrians.” The police report included a handwritten anonymous letter defending him and claiming the whole city was “fearful” of the protesters. His actions were unlawful; there is no right to deliberately strike a pedestrian who is obstructing travel. But he wasn’t charged with a crime. Newsletter sign-up: The Globe Investigates Spotlight reports and special projects that hold the powerful accountable and uncover waste fraud and abuse. Others said the protesters had it coming. In Bowling Green Ky. a 24-year-old man named James Hunton hit a woman with his truck on May 29. “The protesters were in the road” he said using a swear word according to the police report. “They deserved to be hit anybody would.” Hunton was charged with a felony but pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to probation. The vast majority of the protests subject to ramming incidents in 2020 were antiracism efforts while some were held to support other progressive causes including the environment. In at least three cases however the target was a pro-Trump or pro-police protest and the drivers in two of those incidents face steep charges. In Eaton Colo. a 21-year-old man Isaiah Cordova allegedly drove into a Blue Lives Matter Demonstration. No one was injured per local news reports but Cordova faces seven charges of first-degree attempted murder — some of the most serious charges the Globe found (he is expected to enter a plea in December). In Yorba Linda Calif. a 40-year-old woman named Tatiana Turner was accused of hitting Black Lives Matter counter-protesters with her car injuring two according to local news reports and triggering a charge of attempted murder and multiple other felony counts. She has pleaded not guilty. Many motorists who drove into protests were never officially identified. Overall the Globe was able to determine that the identity of 104 of the 139 drivers was known at least to the authorities if not to the public. Of the drivers whose gender was known to the Globe 62 were men and 21 were women. Of drivers whose race was discernible 44 drivers were white while 11 were people of color. One driver Harry H. Rogers had clear ties to a white supremacist group: Prosecutors said he was a leader in the KKK who ran over a bicyclist’s foot at a protest in Richmond Va. He is now serving a six-year prison sentence. Another man who was not arrested reversed his vehicle into a protester in Iowa City after the passenger in his car screamed “white power” at the group. On Long Island a man who shouted “white lives matter” before accelerating toward three teenage protesters of color those protesters told a local news station was sentenced to community service. An Instagram account that appeared to belong to Lisa Michelle O’Quinn of Greenville N.C. contained posts about the Confederate flag and the white race several years ago according to the local paper the Daily Advance. O’Quinn who is white allegedly hit two Black women with her car during a protest of a police shooting in Elizabeth City N.C. on May 24 of this year. She is facing multiple charges but not a hate crime. Officials with the local court told the Globe they were not aware of her yet entering a plea.

In at least 11 cases covered in local news on-duty police officers drove their cars into protesters during confrontations in big cities including Los Angeles and New York and small ones such as Laramie Wyo. (A Boston police sergeant was caught on bodycam footage bragging about hitting protesters last year but there is no evidence he actually struck anyone.) In another case an off-duty corrections officer drove into a protest in Kokomo Ind. leaving two demonstrators with minor injuries. She was charged with criminal recklessness and leaving the scene of an accident and is set to be tried in December. She is the only officer the Globe found to be criminally charged in connection with a vehicle ramming although one officer in New York lost 10 days of pay after hitting a protester with the door of the moving vehicle. Sometimes the police themselves have been targets: Researchers and the Globe tallied five instances in which police officers were hit by vehicles at protests four of which resulted in injuries to officers. That figure is not included in the Globe’s tally of 139 which counts incidents when protesters were targeted although it is a concerning trend. Some drivers seemed to foreshadow their plans on social media. Jared Benjamin Lafer “made a joke on Facebook about hitting a protester with a car” according to the Tennessean newspaper before allegedly doing just that in Johnson City Tenn. on Sept. 12 2020 breaking the victim’s leg. Lafer’s attorney said he thought he and his family who were in the car were in danger. Ultimately a grand jury decided not to indict him. In Denver a man named Jonathan Benson wrote proudly on Facebook that he had hit a protester who he said blocked kicked and cornered his car on the night of President Trump’s inauguration in 2017 according to Westword. Then in September 2020 he had another altercation with protesters ultimately hitting the gas and knocking one aside the publication wrote. Benson claimed he sped into the crowd due to his fear of the protesters surrounding his car saying one hit it with a hammer. The police charged him with reckless driving for the second episode they said but prosecutors dropped the charges saying they could not prove their case. But in Tulsa as in so many cases the identity of the driver remains for the public and the victims but not authorities unknown. After a vehicle hits protesters two very different storylines tend to emerge. One is about protesters terrified by an oncoming vehicle some of whom throw projectiles or their fists at the vehicle in the hopes of stopping it. The other is often a story of a driver who feels besieged and hits the gas also he or she claims as a form of self-defense. In many cases it is the driver protected by thousands of pounds of steel whose account wins out in the eyes of the law. To the district attorney for Tulsa County Steve Kunzweiler the victims in the red truck case were the father mother and two children in the truck — not the injured protesters on the highway. “They made a conscious choice to violate the law when they had a right to be on a protected route” Kunzweiler said in an interview. “They put themselves in harm’s way.” Both Taylor and Knight began to receive hateful messages online that blamed them for what happened. “You should have been killed” read one to Taylor. “Too bad your skull was not crushed.” On July 23 2020 Kunzweiler released a 12-page memo explaining that he would not be charging the driver of the truck. There are seven pages of images detailing the damage protesters did to the truck as it moved through the crowd which included a door handle torn off a shattered windshield and dents and only brief mention of the protesters’ injuries. The gun on the dashboard is not mentioned. “The father described his fear for his own life and the lives of his family as their family truck was surrounded by protesters who began to beat upon the truck with their hands and various weapons to include projectiles thrown at the vehicle” Kunzweiler wrote. “At one point the front windshield was broken and glass fragments flew upon him.” Kunzweiler’s decision drew from an investigation conducted by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol — one that some of the injured protesters believe was biased against them from the outset.

The memo cited interviews with members of the family in the red truck. A lieutenant spoke with King Knight’s girlfriend she said but Knight said he was never interviewed himself. The report said three protesters were injured — Knight an unidentified woman and a third victim Lisa K. Pepin — but did not detail what their injuries were according to the DA’s memo. Taylor is not mentioned by name and troopers never interviewed her about that incident she said even though her attorney Jonathan Nation said he reached out both to the highway patrol and Kunzweiler’s office. “They pretty much took the statement of gospel truth from the driver … it didn’t seem like we were taken seriously from the get-go” Nation said. “I wonder if we were a right-wing protest if we would have been.’' “ They [the protesters] made a conscious choice to violate the law when they had a right to be on a protected route. They put themselves in harm’s way.” — Steve Kunzweiler Tulsa County district attorney The Boston Globe sought a copy of the highway patrol’s investigation and was told by a spokeswoman they had only a two-page document to share. A Freedom of Information Act request filed in August for that report has not been fulfilled. Kunzweiler defended the investigation and his charging decision as thorough although he directed specific questions about Knight and Taylor to highway patrol officials who did not respond to individual questions. “The Oklahoma Highway Patrol did a complete and thorough investigation into the actions of the motorist involved in the incident on May 31 2020 on Interstate 244” said Sarah Stewart a spokeswoman for the highway patrol. The lawyers for Knight and Taylor said they are preparing lawsuits potentially against both the driver of the red truck and law enforcement. Not every injured person disagreed with the decision to not charge the driver. To Pepin a school counselor who was chaperoning her daughter at the protest and fell as the crowd ran away from the truck it made sense. “I don’t think the driver did anything wrong” said Pepin who broke her femur. “[The crowd] just needed to step back and let the truck go through because he was going really slow.” Knight feels as if there was no justice that he still doesn’t have real answers about who hurt him and why. “Why do you go investigate stuff” he wondered “if you don’t want to figure it out?” Not every ramming case goes unsolved or ignored. In April a 22-year-old man named Marshall R. Blanchard pleaded guilty to a hate crime and leaving the scene of an accident after he drove his motorcycle into a protest in Bloomington Ill. injuring two people one of whom got a concussion. He was sentenced this summer to serve seven years in prison. “It sends a message that this type of behavior will not be tolerated when individuals are exercising their right to peacefully protest” said prosecutor Mary Lawson according to WGLT. But the lack of prosecution for many drivers has left protesters and political violence experts afraid that law enforcement is often sending the opposite message — particularly in the three states including Oklahoma that passed laws this year to shield drivers who hit protesters and claim self-defense. “We worry it’s licensing folks to use their vehicle as a weapon” said Hiller of Princeton’s Bridging Divides Initiative. Even Kunzweiler the district attorney who had little sympathy for the injured protesters in Tulsa said he did not think such laws were necessary. He was after all able to absolve the driver under existing state law.

Researchers worry that the sheer number of vehicle rammings last year — and the impunity for many drivers — has normalized the act of driving into a protest raising the possibility there will be more violence the next time demonstrators take to the streets. Back in Oklahoma Taylor and Knight are getting their lives back to normal. Taylor transferred to a university in Eastern Oklahoma where she is studying Cherokee and political science. Knight spends his days helping his youngest children with virtual school driving his kids to scrimmages all over the state and working to strengthen his body. King told him early on in his recovery that he was allowed to feel hurt that he was allowed to feel pain. “She helped me a lot with my emotions because I felt anger” he said. He views what happened that day as continuation of this country’s long history of responding violently to protests. “When they sat at the restaurants when they went over the bridge in Selma they were waiting for them” Knight said. “If you look at history it’s like they’re trying to hurt everybody during every protest.” Now his goals are simple aided by trips to the gym and YouTube videos from other people in wheelchairs. He’s grateful for everything his injury has taught him. “I wanted to straighten my neck up I want to work on my posture” he said. “My goals are just live like everybody else.” Globe staff Liz Goodwin Jazmine Ulloa and Jim Puzzanghera and Globe correspondent Neya Thanikachalam contributed to this report.

The increasing focus on environmental social and governance (“ESG”) considerations at public companies including this year’s highly publicized proxy contest at Exxon Mobil Corporation (“Exxon”) has demonstrated the growing importance of understanding ESG and the implications it can have for investors and companies. Among the many ESG developments bubbling to the forefront of the markets in recent years is the desire of investors to see companies address social justice concerns. In particular shareholders have begun to request that companies conduct racial equity audits (“Racial Equity Audits”) which generally seek an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. We anticipate greater interest in Racial Equity Audits and similar initiatives in the upcoming proxy season and accordingly believe companies will be pushed to critically and objectively examine their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion to identify areas in need of improvement.

A. Overview of the ESG Landscape Today

ESG considerations can be broken down into three categories. First—environmental criteria which considers a company’s actions as a steward of the environment such as what steps a company is taking to address the depletion of the planet’s resources pollution and greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of climate change. Second—social criteria which considers how a company engages with all of its stakeholders (including employees customers and suppliers) rather than just shareholders including the treatment and diversity of its employees on the frontline management and boardroom levels the effects of a company on the surrounding community and whether a company is working with suppliers who share similar socially desirable values. Third—corporate governance which considers how a company governs itself and holds itself accountable taking into account the structure and diversity of a company’s board of directors the separation between management and the board of directors executive compensation equal and fair pay amongst employees and the extent to which a company or its management or board of directors are undertaking lobbying efforts making political and charitable donations or engaging in corruption or bribery.

With the increasing prominence of ESG awareness the market has also seen the rise of ESG-specific funds as a new form of investment vehicle. These funds have explicit mandates to make ESG-focused investments from mutual funds whose portfolio companies must score a high grade on ESG metrics to investment firms dedicated to ESG impact investing. In the U.S. market there are now over 600 ESG funds and exchange-traded funds for investors to choose from with approximately $161 billion in assets under management (“AUM”) which is more than double the AUM of ESG funds in 2010. According to research from Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) “ESG Funds were among the largest winners in 2020 taking in a record $60 billion in net flows nearly triple their 2019 total.”

In the meantime on November 9 2020 the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced the issuance of new final rules that expanded human capital management disclosure requirements applicable to SEC reporting companies. Since then SEC leadership has signaled that more comprehensive ESG-related disclosure could be mandated in the near future with SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee issuing statements earlier this year “directing the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings” and inviting input from “investors registrants and other market participants on climate change disclosure.” Former Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance John Coates also stated earlier in the year that the “SEC should help lead the creation of an effective ESG disclosure system so companies can provide investors with information they need in a cost-effective manner.” Based on these statements we believe there is a strong likelihood that the current SEC-mandated human capital management disclosures will soon be expanded to require additional disclosures covering environmental and other social initiatives and metrics further supporting a view that ESG awareness stewardship and reporting at public companies are here to stay.

As the ESG movement gains momentum and as the new wave of investors who factor ESG concerns into their investment decisions gain a larger share of the market companies are being advised to revisit their current policies and practices under the ESG lens. Companies that dismiss these concerns or lag behind their peers in addressing ESG matters may find themselves in the crosshairs of investors and proxy advisory firms or even state legislatures and federal agencies. On the other hand it has been found that companies that affirmatively adopt meaningful approaches to these issues may not only help progress environmental and societal goals but may also potentially see improved financial performance.

B. How ESG Ties Into Shareholder Activism

ESG considerations are becoming increasingly relevant to shareholder activists. This is because issues relating to climate change and the environment racial justice and diversity human capital and governance may influence companies at large and shareholder investment flows. Governance has long been a key focus of shareholder activists as corporate governance best practices including accountability of a company’s board of directors to its shareholders robust disclosure on executive compensation and independence of a board of directors from management have been found to have a readily apparent correlation with increased returns to shareholders. Recently however activists have begun to realize that social and environmental issues can also impact their investments in both negative and positive ways.

ISS and others have published a number of reports that have found that addressing social and environmental concerns correlates with companies either currently experiencing or having the potential to experience increased growth and profitability. As discussed in more detail below a company’s performance on ESG factors such as investment into renewable energy promotion of employee health and safety and contributions to the local community are pressing issues that can either benefit or adversely affect a company’s perception in the public eye operational execution and bottom line. Enhanced performance in these areas can lead to less scrutiny from environmental regulators increased customer loyalty more productive employees reduced employee turnover more lucrative business partnerships and increased profitability.

Improved ESG criteria is not a new area for activist investors. Shareholder activists have advocated for increased diversity in corporate boardrooms for a number of years. Concurrently with shareholder activists nominating an increasing number of diverse director candidates the voting policies of many institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc. (“BlackRock”) have been updated to reflect a desire to enhance boardroom diversity as have the voting guidelines of many prominent proxy advisory firms such as ISS. State governments have also codified ESG initiatives into law—California leading the charge with the passage of Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 which require a certain percentage of directors on the boards of public companies headquartered in the state be composed of females and individuals from underrepresented communities. Most shareholder activists are cognizant of the stance of institutional investors and proxy advisory firms on ESG issues and have increasingly incorporated ESG factors into their proxy campaigns.

C. Recent Push for Racial Equity Audits

Amongst the various ESG developments gaining traction in the markets is the recent push by shareholders for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits which generally consist of an objective investigation into a company’s practices policies and histories to determine such company’s impact on social issues and areas for improvement. In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020 and the subsequent civil rights movement and unrest many companies announced a number of initiatives and measures to address social justice issues including committing financial resources and reviewing their own policies and practices. However many advocates believe that without objective means to identify areas of improvement and monitor companies’ progress these commitments may be illusory and confirmation that these companies have in fact met their commitments could be difficult. Accordingly the 2021 proxy season saw an influx of shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (“Rule 14a-8”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits.

Just like its environmental and corporate governance counterparts addressing social concerns can be equally important to companies and investors alike as this can translate into among other things value additive results. For example following a racially-tinged incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks in 2018 where two African-American men who were waiting for a business meeting to begin were arrested the company performed a Racial Equity Audit which found that among other things racial sensitivity and the elimination of implicit biases are correlated to Starbuck’s core business plan of “creating an inclusive and equitable working environment as well as a welcoming ‘third place’ between home and work for customers.” In addition the W.K. Kellogg Foundation has found that “[b]y 2050 our country stands to realize an $8 trillion gain in GDP by closing the U.S. racial equity gap.”

II: Background and Overview

A. What Are Racial Equity Audits?

A Racial Equity Audit is at its core an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. Not only are Racial Equity Audits designed to help inform investors about their current and future investments from a social and financial perspective but are also intended to help companies craft their policies and practices to achieve their social justice goals.

According to certain proponents the point of a Racial Equity Audit is not necessarily to critique a company’s current platforms and efforts. Rather as argued by Trillium Asset Management (“Trillium”) a strong proponent of such audits the point of an audit is to embrace the notion that “if management is truly committed to make racial justice a critical element of its operations then in practice it can and should treat it like any other operations issue and audit it as such.” These proponents further argue that Racial Equity Audits should not be viewed as the end of a process for companies and/or shareholders looking to make a change; instead they can be a “stepping stone” to assist companies in developing and identifying a strategic plan to advance their goals.

B. What Impact Can a Racial Equity Audit Have on a Company’s Social Equity Policies and Practices?

The impact a Racial Equity Audit may have on a company may be felt in many ways. Racial Equity Audits can focus on various aspects of a company’s business including the treatment of customers at a company’s physical locations the diversity of senior management the targeting of products and even political contributions. Following an audit some companies have used the findings to develop a strategic plan to capitalize on opportunities to address racial equity moving forward. For example following the voluntary Racial Equity Audit conducted by Starbucks after the 2018 incident discussed above the company began requiring implicit bias training for employees setting public corporate diversity goals and implementing a number of other social initiatives. The public announcement of the Racial Equity Audit and related diversity equity and inclusion efforts appeared to not only rehabilitate Starbucks’ public image after the incident but helped the company become the “most popular restaurant stock on the S&P 500 with actively managed funds that are dedicated to ESG investing” according to RBC Capital Markets.

Racial Equity Audits may also find that a company’s existing policies and practices are not sufficient to address or may be perpetuating systemic social issues. For example in the supporting statement submitted by the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) to its Racial Equity Audit proposal included in the proxy statement for The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (“Goldman”) 2021 annual meeting of shareholders SEIU detailed Goldman’s alleged contributions to systemic racism. Specifically SEIU stated that “Goldman underwrites municipal bonds whose proceeds pay police brutality settlements.” Similarly Trillium on behalf of Christopher and Anne Ellinger submitted a Racial Equity Audit proposal that was included in Johnson & Johnson’s proxy statement for its 2021 annual meeting of shareholders in which Trillium expressed concerns with claims that the company continues to market its talc-based baby powder to “Black and Brown women after its talc supplier included the WHO’s ‘possibly carcinogenic’ label on shipments.” Proponents of Racial Equity Audits argue that a reassessment of internal policies and practices via such audits can identify the right levers to pull to begin to shrink these racial divides.

C. What Is the Democracy Case For Racial Equity Audits?

Civil rights advocates and proponents of social justice have long touted the moral and ethical considerations of closing the racial divide in America. Recently investors and companies have also begun to appreciate that positive financial returns are often associated with investing in initiatives working towards racial equality. Beyond the moral case and business case for conducting Racial Equity Audits and fighting systemic racism in general is the “democracy case” espoused by social justice advocates and that corporations can at times act more swiftly and have a more profound effect on current social issues than the government; therefore these advocates argue that corporations have a responsibility to address issues affecting our democracy. Racial Equity Audits can be designed to help identify if and where these issues exist within a company so that management can address them most effectively.

D. How Racial Equity Audits May Boost Financial Returns and Growth

Some studies have shown that “promoting racial justice can increase profitability and competitive advantage.” A study by McKinsey & Company found that implementing or improving racial justice policies can positively affect a company’s bottom line. As illustrated in the study companies with the highest degrees of ethnic/cultural diversity were 33% more likely to outperform their less diverse peers and companies with the most ethnically/culturally diverse boards of directors are 43% more likely to experience higher profits than their less diverse peers. A study by a Citigroup Inc. (“Citi”) global economist found that addressing racial disparities can have even broader macro benefits. According to this study “closing racial gaps would have generated an additional $16 trillion in economic output since [the year] 2000” and “by closing the various gaps between Blacks and Whites the U.S. could stand to gain an additional $5 trillion in economic activity over the next five years.” Racial Equity Audits could therefore prove to be a critical tool for companies looking to capture some of these unrealized gains.

E. How Investment Managers Especially Pension Fund Trustees Pushing to Address Racism May Be Consistent With Their Fiduciary Duties to Maximize Returns for Investors

A fiduciary’s duty is to act in the best interest of their beneficiaries and traditionally translates to acting to obtain the highest return on investment but it can be equally important that fiduciaries seek to minimize risk. Accordingly it has been argued that working to ensure that systemic risk in the marketplace is proactively addressed via for example a Racial Equity Audit is consistent with a fiduciary’s duties. Advocates of Racial Equity Audits believe that they are essentially intended to be implemented in furtherance of risk management and risk tolerance criteria that fiduciaries may choose to measure in order to protect their investments.

In addition there has also been a rise in ESG-specific funds as well as a growing number of ESG-specific products at mutual funds and other financial institutions. Beyond fund managers’ typical fiduciary duties to minimize risk and achieve positive returns these fiduciaries are explicitly mandated with making investments into companies that “aim to have a sustainable and societal impact in the world” based on ESG criteria or that “meet stringent environmental social and governance standards.” As the usefulness of Racial Equity Audits as a tool for ESG-conscious shareholders to measure a company’s adherence to ESG prerogatives becomes more mainstream it would be no surprise to see support for these audits grow.

F. How Professionals in the Area Believe Audits Should Be Conducted and the Importance of Independent Third Party Reviews

No two companies are identical. Every company has a different mix of products operations and services; therefore according to practitioners in the area it is important for participants in a Racial Equity Audit to identify the scope of the audit and benchmarks prior to conducting the audit. New York State Comptroller Thomas F. DiNapoli a staunch advocate of Racial Equity Audits has stated that such an audit should ascertain at least three things:

First whether a company’s policies practices and products are equitable and nondiscriminatory for employees customers and the communities in which they operate. Second whether any changes to existing programs or new measures or initiatives would help a company become more equitable and inclusive. And lastly whether a company has sufficient mechanisms in place to monitor effectiveness.

Practitioners also stress the importance of auditors using the right methodology including both quantitative and qualitative methods and for such auditors to review not only information provided by the company but to gather its own information. Accordingly auditors are encouraged to solicit information directly through surveys and interviews and to review historical records and a company’s performance against its peers.

Practitioners also believe that the audit process can be important for companies as a way to build trust with their stakeholders. To that end they believe companies should clearly disclose and explain the processes and personnel roles within a Racial Equity Audit and undertake to publicly share the results of the audit. Practitioners also stress the importance of identifying and engaging the “process owners” (e.g. the Chief Executive Officer Chief Legal Officer or Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer) as the persons who will actually drive the implementation of recommended initiatives. Advocates believe it is critical that the audit be conducted by an independent third party in order to ensure integrity and credibility throughout the process. Comptroller DiNapoli has observed that discrimination can be “deep-seated” within a company and “internal self-reviews have the potential to reinforce current structural impediments and biases” which is why he believes it is necessary for audits to be an independent assessment.

G. Which Companies Have Already Conducted Racial Equity Audits How Were They Conducted and What Were the Results?

Some companies have independently engaged in Racial Equity Audits or similar internal reviews usually in response to external pressures. As discussed earlier Starbucks undertook a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”) also conducted its own version of a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. The audit was led by Laura W. Murphy a civil rights advocate with help from a civil rights law firm. The Facebook audit began “at the behest and encouragement of the civil rights community and some members of Congress proceeded with Facebook’s cooperation and [was] intended to help the company identify prioritize and implement sustained and comprehensive improvements to the way it impacts civil rights.” The audit process included interviewing over 100 civil rights organizations several hundred more advocates as well as members of Congress. The aspects of Facebook that the audit focused on were informed by the aforementioned interviews which led to a holistic review of the entire company and not just a single aspect such as employment practices. The audit produced three reports which ultimately described how Facebook utilized the audit process “to listen plan and deliver on various consequential changes that will help advance the civil rights of its users” in a number of categories and also recommended implementation of specific action items including to (1) “continue to onboard expertise” (2) “build out the civil rights leader’s team” (3) “expand civil rights product review processes” (4) “require civil rights perspectives in escalation of key content decisions” and (5) “prioritize civil rights.” The thoroughness of the audit and the response and subsequent actions taken by the company have led to the Facebook audit being heralded by many as a big success.

H. Pushback to Racial Equity Audits

A number of other high-profile companies and financial institutions have been approached either by shareholders or civil rights advocates about conducting Racial Equity Audits. However not all companies have been as eager and willing to comply with these requests. As discussed further below several financial institutions including Citi JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman have resisted shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits stating that they would either fold such measures into their existing human rights assessments or that they didn’t believe it was the appropriate time for such an endeavor.

III: Rule 14a-8 Proposals—The Initial Stages of Advocacy

A. Shareholder Proposals

Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 shareholders may submit proposals to be included in a company’s proxy materials for its annual or special meetings of shareholders. Under Rule 14a-8 a company is required to include a shareholder proposal and related supporting statement in its proxy statement and list the shareholder proposal on its proxy card to be voted on with the company’s proposals if: (a) the shareholder satisfies specified eligibility and procedural requirements; and (b) the proposal is not excludable under Rule 14a-8(i). If the company determines that it is not in the best interests of the company to include a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal in its proxy materials it can (i) seek no-action relief from the SEC staff (the “Staff”) that if granted would allow the company to exclude the proposal without the threat of Staff recommendation of an enforcement action based on a procedural deficiency or a substantive exclusion under Rule 14a-8; (ii) take legal action in court to exclude the proposal; and/or (iii) negotiate with the proponent to withdraw the proposal. Shareholder proposals come from a variety of proponents including individual investors labor unions public pension funds shareholder activists and institutional investors and such proposals often focus on the environment corporate governance executive compensation and social issues. According to Forbes Magazine the past proxy season “set new records with at least 467 shareholder resolutions on environmental social and governance (ESG) issues.”

The Sustainable Investments Institute reports that 28 shareholder proposals dealing with racial justice had been included in proxy statements filed with the SEC as of April 27 2021. Certain of these racial justice proposals submitted by shareholders included proposals calling for Racial Equity Audits. For example the SOC Investment Group formerly known as the CtW Investment Group (“CtW”) a group that works with pension funds sponsored by unions affiliated with Change to Win a federation of unions representing nearly 5.5 million members submitted the following proposal to Bank of America Corporation for inclusion in its proxy statement:

RESOLVED that shareholders of Bank of America Corporation (“BofA”) urge the Board of Directors to oversee a racial equity audit analyzing BofA’s adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil rights organizations employees and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed. A report on the audit prepared at reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary information should be publicly disclosed on BofA’s website.

Similar Racial Equity Audit proposals were submitted by shareholders at several public companies during the 2021 proxy season with substantially the same resolution clause copied above but with different issues highlighted. In general Racial Equity Audit proposals ask the board of directors of a company to oversee such audits analyzing the company’s “business models—from policies to products and services—to determine whether they cause reinforce or perpetuate discrimination.”

B. Why Proponents Submit Racial Equity Audit Proposals

According to public policy analysts racial violence and the COVID-19 pandemic sparked an increase in Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals focused on racial justice. Several of the supporting statements for Racial Equity Audit proposals stated that:

High-profile police killings of black people—most recently George Floyd—have galvanized the movement for racial justice. That movement together with the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused the attention of the media the public and policy makers on systemic racism racialized violence and inequities in employment health care and the criminal justice system.

Proponents contend that Racial Equity Audits would help public companies “identify prioritize remedy and avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color” and would help a company’s board of directors assess such company’s “behavior through a racial equity lens in order to obtain a complete picture of how it contributes to and could help dismantle systemic racism.”

The chart below lists the proponents who submitted Racial Equity Audit proposals to public companies pursuant to Rule 14a-8 during the 2021 proxy season and the number of proposals they submitted:

C. Public Company Resistance to Racial Equity Audit Proposals

Boards of directors of public companies are “[i]ncreasingly . . . called upon to navigate the challenges presented by climate change racial injustice economic inequality and numerous other issues that are fundamental to the success and sustainability of companies financial markets and our economy.” After the May 2020 killing of George Floyd 66% of S&P 500 companies posted statements on their websites or social media accounts 36% made financial contributions to racial justice organizations and 14% stated in their communications that “Black Lives Matter.” While it has been observed that these companies were “quick to issue statements supporting Black Lives Matter and promis[ed] to do more to be responsive to non-white consumers employees and communities” most companies on the receiving end of a Rule 14a-8 proposal to implement a Racial Equity Audit have actively resisted such proposal by seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal from their 2021 proxy statements negotiating with proponents to withdraw their proposals and when the company had been unsuccessful with the foregoing recommending that shareholders vote against the proposals. In doing so these companies have argued that they have already taken measures to address racial justice such as “investing in Black entrepreneurs expanding credit and working to boost diversity within their ranks.”

Companies Sought No-Action Relief . Companies that sought to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals from their 2021 proxy statements by requesting no-action relief from the SEC argued that the exclusions set forth in sections (i)(3) (i)(7) or (i)(10) of Rule 14a-8 applied.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(10) a company is permitted to exclude a shareholder proposal if the company has already substantially implemented the proposal. The Staff has stated that “substantial” implementation under the rule does not require the company to have implemented the proposal in full or exactly as proposed by the shareholder. To demonstrate that they had substantially implemented the audit proposals companies argued they had (i) made pledges and commitments towards racial justice initiatives and made such information publicly available; (ii) issued ESG and/or diversity focused reports; (iii) issued press releases and public disclosures addressing racial inequality; (iv) implemented initiatives to advance racial equity; or (v) financially committed to racial justice initiatives and causes.

Rule 14a-8(i)(7) allows exclusion of proposals related to a company’s ordinary business operations. SEC interpretations of this rule provide that proposals that concern ordinary business matters but focus on significant social policy issues would not be excludable because “the proposals would transcend the day-to-day business matters.” In seeking to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals companies argued that these audits concerned day-to-day aspects of their ordinary business operations including: (i) “product sales and advertising;” (ii) “customer relationships;” (iii) the “nature of the company’s public relations messaging and communications with its shareholders and other constituents;” (iv) “workforce management;” (v) “relationships with suppliers;” (vi) “community impacts;” or (vii) “decisions regarding the products and services [the company] offers.” Furthermore these companies contended that the proposals did not focus on a significant policy issue that transcended their ordinary business.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(3) a shareholder proposal may be excluded from a company’s proxy materials if the proposal or the supporting statement accompanying the proposal is contrary to any of the federal proxy rules including Rule 14a-9 which prohibits a company from disclosing materially false or misleading statements in its proxy materials. The Staff has recognized that exclusion is permitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) if “the resolution contained in the proposal is so inherently vague or indefinite that neither the stockholders voting on the proposal nor the company in implementing the proposal (if adopted) would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty exactly what actions or measures the proposal requires.” Johnson & Johnson the only company to invoke Rule 14a-8(i)(3) during the 2021 proxy season to attempt to exclude a Racial Equity Audit proposal argued that the proposal was impermissibly vague and indefinite because “neither Johnson & Johnson nor shareholders would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty what actions or measures the proposal requires.”

The SEC considered the arguments described above to exclude the shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits and in each case the SEC did not concur with the company that the shareholder proposal should be excluded. Below is a chart listing the shareholder proposals submitted at various companies during the 2021 proxy season the proponent the regulatory basis to exclude the proposal invoked by the company and the SEC’s response to the company’s request for exclusion.

Companies Negotiated with Shareholders to Withdraw the Racial Equity Audit Proposal . BlackRock the world’s largest asset management firm and CoreCivic Inc. (“CoreCivic”) an operator of private prisons have agreed to conduct independent Racial Equity Audits after receiving shareholder proposals for such audits resulting in the proponents withdrawing their proposals. In the financial industry BlackRock’s decision distinguishes it from other financial institutions that have asked shareholders to vote against similar audit proposals and/or have sought no-action relief from the SEC.

Companies Recommended Voting Against Racial Equity Audit Proposals . Most companies who may have been unsuccessful in seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal or in negotiating a resolution with a shareholder to withdraw the proposal have recommended that shareholders vote against the proposals. These companies have asserted that they disagree with the “approach” of Racial Equity Audit proposals but are “aligned with [their] stated goal of addressing racial inequity in the financial sector.”

For example the board of directors of Citi recommended a vote against the Racial Equity Audit proposal included in its 2021 proxy statement noting that “[a]s recently as September 2020 Citi released a 104 page report on the economic cost of Black inequality in the United States titled Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps” and said its efforts on these issues are available to the public. Wells Fargo Co. (“Wells Fargo”) said it is conducting a “human rights impact assessment” and that it will update its Human Rights Statement to better align with the expectations of companies under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Wells Fargo also said it is making efforts toward “expanding [its] diversity and inclusion commitments with a focus on hiring promotions and turnover with increased accountability across all of those areas and [is] taking specific actions in support of these commitments.” The board of directors of Goldman recommended that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on a Racial Equity Audit saying it has taken additional steps toward racial equity in the past year including assessing its “shortcomings” and committing to hiring more analysts from “historically Black colleges and universities while maintaining [its] existing programs focused on other diverse populations.” Goldman also pointed out that it is “[b]uilding upon more than $200 million of grants in minority communities and to minority-owned businesses over the past two decades” and “in 2020 [Goldman] created the Fund for Racial Equity to support the vital work of leading nonprofits that are addressing racial injustice structural inequity and economic disparity which has committed $10 million from GS Gives in addition to matching employee contributions to recipient organizations.”

D. Proxy Advisors’ Positions on Racial Equity Audits

The two leading proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis & Co. LLC (“Glass Lewis”) have generally taken opposing views on Racial Equity Audits. According to Bloomberg Glass Lewis “has broadly said conducting the audits would help companies reduce risks of high-profile controversies that may result in customer and employee attrition regulatory inquiries and significant fines” and that “‘[g]iven broad societal changes it is particularly important for consumer-facing companies’ which depend on their customers’ trust and loyalty ‘to address issues of racial equity.’” On the other hand according to Bloomberg ISS has stated that “racial audits aren’t warranted because companies are taking ‘sufficient meaningful actions’ to address racial inequities such as expanding opportunities for people and communities of color as well as improving the diversity and inclusion of its workforces.” The following chart sets forth the recommendations ISS and Glass Lewis made with respect to each Racial Equity Audit proposal in the 2021 proxy season:

E. Amazon’S Response to a Racial Equity Audit Proposal—A Case Study

During the 2021 proxy season Amazon.com Inc. (“Amazon”) faced a shareholder proposal requesting the company to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. The proposal was submitted by Comptroller DiNapoli as trustee of New York State’s Common Retirement Fund for public employees which owns shares in Amazon. Comptroller DiNapoli was joined by other Amazon shareholders in requesting Amazon’s board of directors to commission a Racial Equity Audit that would analyze two main issues: (1) Amazon’s “impacts on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” and (2) the “impacts of those issues on Amazon’s business.” In response Amazon sent a letter to the SEC seeking to exclude the proposal from its 2021 proxy materials. Amazon argued that regardless of the proposal being “framed in the form of a request for a report” this did not change the fact that the “subject matter of the proposed report is within [Amazon’s] ordinary business” and thus excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

Amazon argued the proposal’s call to review its impact “on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” is a “broad survey on the impact of the Company’s policies practices products and services on societal issues” which implicates “routine business issues” such as “the products and services that the Company offers to its customers the Company’s business practices and operations the Company’s strategic decisions and the Company’s choice of technologies.” Similarly according to Amazon such an audit would “necessarily implicate[] a multitude of ordinary business matters relating to the Company’s day-to-day operations” which Amazon argued included decisions relating to among other things its charitable donations hiring decisions diversity and recruitment initiatives customer relations advertising public relations and communications with its shareholders and the kinds of products it sold. Despite the laundry list of examples Amazon cited in its No-Action Letter the SEC did not concur that the proposal was excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

In a webinar hosted by CtW Comptroller DiNapoli explained the importance of racial equity at Amazon and why shareholders should vote in favor of the proposal and argued that “racial inequity is harming the United States economy.” DiNapoli argued that “the pattern and magnitude of issues repeatedly facing the company demonstrate a need for a more in-depth review . . . Concerns related to workforce diversity treatment of minority workers environmental justice in communities of color surveillance and civil rights are just some of the controversies that have troubled Amazon.” For example current and former Amazon employees have accused the company of allowing racism to permeate its operations. The company’s environmental impact has also been called out for allegedly disproportionately affecting minority communities. Comptroller DiNapoli expressed concern with Amazon’s alleged lack of transparency stating that while the company has put policies in place to address this issue it “has not reported to investors the effectiveness or the process for completing its ongoing policy review.” In 2020 Amazon conducted its first human rights assessment which it referenced to support its position that there was no need to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. However Comptroller DiNapoli noted “a human rights assessment is not the same as an independent racial equity audit and shareholders should be weary of equating the two.”

On May 26 2021 Amazon shareholders rejected eleven shareholder proposals at the annual meeting. Among these the proposal for a Racial Equity Audit garnered the most support with 44% of the votes cast on this proposal voting in favor. Comptroller DiNapoli described the vote as “an immense success for a first-time proposal . . . [i]f CEO Jeff Bezos’ shares (70616270 shares 14%) were to be removed from those voting ‘against’ it the proposal received majority support.”

IV: The Focus of Racial Equity Audits on the Financial Industry

Financial institutions and asset management firms have become the focus of Racial Equity Audit shareholder proposals. According to CtW this focus is based on the belief that:

the finance industry has played a critical role in perpetuating unequal wealth distribution to communities of color. Whether it be modern day ‘redlining’ techniques related to mortgage loans to excessive checking account fees to most recently Payday [sic] Protection Program distribution communities of color have faced decades of discrimination as a result of the financial industry’s policies and practices.

While the financial institutions that have received Racial Equity Audit proposals have recently made philanthropic and strategic investments along with other commitments to racial equity CtW has stated that “the only way to effectively address racial injustice and economic inequality is careful study of how the industry’s products and services have contributed to this imbalance” which includes analyzing mortgage issuances the number of bank branches in minority neighborhoods or “banking deserts” and whether charitable contributions are “fully aligned with . . . public statements.”

A. An Outlier in the Financial Industry—BlackRock Agrees to a Racial Equity Audit

BlackRock’s response to the Racial Equity Audit proposal that SEIU submitted for inclusion in its proxy statement was an outlier among the other financial and asset management firms that faced similar proposals. Like the other companies that received shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season SEIU’s proposal urged BlackRock to “assess its behavior through a racial equity lens to identify how it contributes to systemic racism” including where its stated values are misaligned with the impact of its actions. The resolution included in SEIU’s proposal also noted that:

A 2020 report on proxy voting found that BlackRock did not use its clout as a significant owner to advance racial justice. BlackRock opposed nearly all shareholder proposals directly addressing racial justice issues including two proposals at Amazon seeking disclosure regarding hate-promoting products and effects of its facial recognition technology on people of color.

According to SEIU BlackRock “decided that the SEIU proposal is too important to wait until they are voted on at their shareholder meetings” and announced its plans to voluntarily conduct an independent racial audit of its operations. As a result the shareholder proposal was withdrawn and SEIU announced that it was currently working with BlackRock to bring about “needed change within the company and the financial services industry.” Commentators anticipate that BlackRock’s commitment to a Racial Equity Audit “could sway other financial services companies to follow in its footsteps.”

V: Developments for Future Proxy Seasons

A. Racial Audits May Be Here to Stay

ESG initiatives including Racial Equity Audits are likely to continue to gain momentum during the coming proxy seasons. As ESG issues garner more media attention and as younger generations move into the investing space these issues and related disclosures may become increasingly important to consumers investors and other stakeholders. Racial Equity Audits could emerge as a critical tool for companies to evaluate their current social impact and provide an objective method for investors to monitor their investments and potentially identify new companies that could benefit from increased social and economic engagement.

While we witnessed an increase in shareholder proposals related to Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season all such proposals were either withdrawn or defeated. However as Racial Equity Audits become more commonplace and enter the cultural norm these proposals may begin to resonate with more stakeholders and be approved by shareholders as early as the next proxy season.

B. Proactive Companies May Try to Cut These Initiatives Off at the Pass

In light of the anticipated increase in the number of Racial Equity Audit proposals in the coming proxy seasons we may see a corresponding rise in the number of companies that follow BlackRock’s lead and voluntarily conduct their own Racial Equity Audits. Proponents of Racial Equity Audits warn that such audits should be conducted in a robust manner by fully independent third parties and that the subject companies take action to address deficiencies shortcomings and concerns uncovered by the audits. Otherwise these proponents posit a lackluster or hastily conducted Racial Equity Audit or failure to take meaningful action in response to an audit may actually have the opposite effect for the implementing institution—instead of insulating the company from potential proposals demanding Racial Equity Audits faulty or perfunctory audits may instead create a target on the institution’s back for ESG activists in the following years.

C. Proxy Advisory Firms Likely to Weigh In

No major proxy advisory firm has issued official voting guidance on the implementation of Racial Equity Audits—and the two largest advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have been split on their support for shareholder proposals requesting such audits. However in the coming years we believe this is an area in which the proxy advisory firms may issue official voting guidance. On July 28 2021 ISS launched its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey which included requests for feedback on Racial Equity Audits. ISS will use the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey as a “key component of ISS’ annual policy development process to assess potential policy changes across regions and markets for 2022 and beyond.” While ISS has largely appeared hesitant to support Racial Equity Audits in the circumstances presented in the 2021 proxy season the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey could change its future guidance and recommendations on such audits. As the area develops (and if more companies voluntarily implement these audits) Racial Equity Audits could become viewed as good corporate governance particularly if top proxy advisory firms issue official guidance supporting the implementation of such audits.

The proxy advisory firms’ level of guidance may take varying forms—at the low end proxy advisory firms may increase a company’s ESG or corporate governance “score” for having in the past or recently conducted a Racial Equity Audit. At the higher end proxy advisory firms may offer official guidelines on what they believe are minimum actions a company should take with respect to Racial Equity Audits in order to receive the advisor’s support. For example such guidelines may provide for a minimum frequency of Racial Equity Audits and indicate parameters on what attributes an audit must possess to be considered sufficient. In this case failure to have a Racial Equity Audit policy or refusal to implement such a policy after shareholders have approved a proposal to implement one may become a criteria an advisory firm would consider in making a recommendation for or against the re-election of a company’s chairperson of the governance committee and/or the re-election of other directors at the company’s annual meeting.

Clear guidance from proxy advisory firms would also be beneficial to companies considering implementing Racial Equity Audit policies by offering indications on what parameters constitute “best practices” and how frequently these audits should occur. By offering such guidance companies may find it easier to voluntarily implement Racial Equity Audit policies.

D. Potential Legislative or Regulatory Mandates

Even with an increase in the number of shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits it is possible that companies may not adopt them as quickly or as widely as the public and/or certain legislative bodies would prefer. If this occurs legislators and/or regulatory authorities may at some point in the future step in to close the gap between investor demand and practical implementation. We saw this occur in California with Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 discussed in further detail above. As the general public’s views evolve on ESG issues public pressure for certain actions—in this case increased diversity in public boardrooms—often influence not just shareholder advocacy but legislative action. The California legislature recognized the public desire to move towards greater diversity on public boards and codified set requirements. In this way legislatures and/or regulatory authorities have the ability to serve as the catalyst for change and wider-reaching adoption by forcing companies that might have been unlikely or slow to act on their own to adopt such policies.

Indeed the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion is currently reviewing legislation that would require banks to conduct Racial Equity Audits every two years in an effort to promote diversity and equity. The proposed Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act would require such audits by independent third parties of the subject companies’ “policies and practices pertaining to civil rights equity diversity and inclusion.” The initial debates on the draft legislation also considered adding to the draft bill penalties for non-compliance including fines of up to $20000 a day for failure to engage in such audits. The draft legislation would also require banks to investigate what ties they may have to slavery and disclose steps such institution would take to reconcile profits it may have received from slavery. The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Joyce Beatty and co-sponsored by Reps. Nikema Williams and Jesus G. Garcia and is currently under committee review.

Other external forces that may prompt public companies to adopt Racial Equity Audit policies are the SEC and the securities exchanges. Currently neither the SEC nor the major U.S. securities exchanges mandate publicly traded companies to make disclosures regarding Racial Equity Audit initiatives. However on August 6 2021 the SEC approved new listing rules proposed by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) requiring each Nasdaq-listed company to disclose certain information about the diversity of its board of directors and generally include a minimum number of members of its board of directors who are Diverse (as defined within the new listing rules). Accordingly as Racial Equity Audits become an increasingly important area for investors it is possible that the SEC and the major exchanges may eventually require companies to make further diversity equity and inclusion disclosures which may include the existence and frequency of a company’s Racial Equity Audits.

Legislative or regulatory requirements are not without their own risks and compliance with any such minimum standards would not be fool proof to insulate a company from potential ESG proposals and proxy campaigns. Racial Equity Audits and similar equity and inclusion initiatives that are not robust or designed with the aid of independent third party consultants may risk being perceived as mere “window dressing” and invite criticism from shareholders.

E. Companies Should Stay Informed in This Area

Given current trends in ESG public companies should stay informed on Racial Equity Audits and their adoption crafting and implementation. Further companies wishing to stay ahead of the curve may start by critically and objectively looking at their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion and identifying areas in need of improvement. If a company lags behind in this quickly developing area we believe shareholders may become more willing to launch shareholder campaigns focused on ESG issues including demanding objective results through Racial Equity Audits.

22Supra note 10. The most recent and prominent example of the intersection between shareholder activism and ESG was the 2021 proxy contest at Exxon. Exxon has faced pressure from shareholders to shift practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon faces proxy fight launched by new activist firm Engine No. 1 Reuters Svea Herbst-Bayliss Gary McWilliams December 7 2020 available at https://www.reuters.com/article/exxon-shareholders-engine-no-1/exxon-faces-proxy-fight-launched-by-new-activist-firm-engine-no-1-idUSKBN28H2IO. Shareholder activist Engine No. 1 grew impatient with Exxon after years of declining financials and long-continued dependency on fossil fuels with no indication of future change. Id. As a result Engine No. 1 launched a proxy campaign in December 2020 to effect change on Exxon’s board of directors. Id. The activist investor nominated a slate of four director candidates with expertise operating energy companies and utilizing clean technology. Id. Dismissal and neglect of these concerns led to Engine No. 1’s unprecedented victory with three of its director nominees being elected to Exxon’s board at its 2021 annual meeting—sending a clear message that environmental concerns and proactive planning are deeply important to Exxon’s shareholders.(go back)

By Ronni Newton

A single-vehicle crash late Saturday night resulted in heavy damage to the car and to a utility pole on South Main Street West Hartford Police Capt. Eric Rocheleau said.

Police said the crash happened in the vicinity of 349 South Main Street at 11:49 p.m. Saturday. The driver who was the sole occupant of the vehicle was out of the car when emergency crews including from the police fire and American Medical Response arrived at the scene.

The driver was taken by ambulance to a local hospital as a precaution police said. No further information about the driver or nature of the injuries was provided by police.

The crash happened just south of Rockledge Golf Course where the road curves and is one of many crashes recently on that stretch of road.

It was raining and the roadway was wet at the time of the crash.

According to witnesses who provided photos to We-Ha.com the force of the crash sent the car’s engine flying across the road.

South Main Street was closed for hours for repairs of the utility pole by Eversource but reopened around 9 a.m. Sunday.

With playline fashion dolls and the first Disney Villain to be included in the collectible Disney Style Series these new releases can make your home more sinister than ever. Hasbro sent us the entire line to review and we’ve included an unboxing video at the end of this post which showcases some of the extra fun of the collection.

Sold individually the Sinister Styles dolls retail for $20.99 and include one Disney Villain fashion doll and accessories. With completely plastic-free packaging each doll comes with a red magic mirror that can be used to reveal hidden compartments within the box to find accessories for each doll. Their dresses also included a few hidden items that can only be seen through the red transparent mirror.

The Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs comes with a collar cauldron poison apple and red shoes with a poison apple design on the front and the dagger from her heart-shaped box on the back. The magic mirror reveals poisoned apples in the design of her dress.

Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty comes with a bright green flame that can be held in her hands a scepter a dragon collar and a pair of shoes that look like purple flames. The magic mirror reveals a dragon emerging from the flames on her dress.

Cruella De Vil from 101 Dalmatians comes with a removable skirt belt two pairs of shoes one of which features the hood of her classic car on the front and a purse. The magic mirror reveals spots along the red hem of her dress.

Ursula from The Little Mermaid comes with a necklace with the magic shell in it a trident laced with tentacles tentacle shoes and a cauldron. The magic mirror reveals the shell necklace on her dress.

The packaging for this collection is beautiful and can become a convenient way to store the dolls and their accessories. With elements of the box revealing compartments with the magic mirrors parents may find that kids don’t want to recycle them at least not right away.

Three of the Disney Villains in this collection also correspond to Disney Princess dolls from Hasbro making them fun playline companions to Snow White Aurora and Ariel.

The Black and Brights Collection is a 4-pack that features the same four dolls although they are in different styles. Retailing for $68.99 this box set saves a little over $10 off the individual price but also includes fewer accessories. Each character comes with a pair of shoes and The Queen also has a collar but that’s the extent of the accessories.

With brighter neon designs some of the characters in the Black and Brights Collection look closer to their movie versions. Maleficent for example has black horns and a darker dress looking closer to the way she appears in Sleeping Beauty. The dolls also have translucent vinyl embellishments including flamed fringe on Maleficent’s sleeves and twisting tentacles on Ursula’s dress.

The shoes in this line are the same plastic molds as the Sinister Styles dolls but they’re all a different color typically black or dark purple. In the case of Cruella De Vil she only includes one pair of shoes in the box set the ones with the hood of her car on the front.

The Disney Style Series Cruella De Vil doll is in packaging similar to last year’s holiday Cinderella doll a wider box that makes it easier to see the doll in all her beauty without removing her from the box. She uses the same face mold from the playline doll but has rooted eyelashes more deluxe hair and her body is more articulated with bendable elbows and wrists in addition to shoulders hips and neck. This doll retails for $41.99.

One side of the box is dated with the year of release 2021 and the back of the box shows the concept art for this fashion-forward doll.

Using the included faceted doll stand which matches the one that comes with previous Disney Style Series dolls it’s easy to pose and display your Cruella De Vil doll however you wish.

The shoes are a red version of the second pair that came with the Sinister Styles dolls which has diamond accents that match this doll’s earrings.

The shawl is removable and the earrings have a metallic look a white gem on the black side of Cruella’s hair part and a black gem on the white side. The center of the dress includes the red accent color on a matching gem.

Her handbag has a metallic-looking clasp and along with glitter dot accents these pieces catch the light and create a striking appearance.

With a flowing tulle skirt with cascading hues of black and white the Disney Style Series Cruella De Vil is a vision to behold from any angle.

Brand-new in fall 2021 all of these Disney Villains dolls from Hasbro are a lot of fun and a nice way to celebrate some classic Disney characters without repeating the same 12 Disney Princess characters again. You can see more of each doll including the hidden reveals through the magic mirrors in our unboxing video.

Hasbro Pulse also featured the below blurb.





Trick or treat? A Ghostbuster never knows when they may need to bust some ghosts so it’s best to always be prepared!

(Plasma Series Neutrona Wand sold separately so while you’re at it get one of those too if you haven’t yet….)

One thing I’d like to point out is it appears that the Ghostbusters: Afterlife-themed hose looks be an entirely different connection than what came with the Ghostbusters Plasma Series Spengler’s Neautrona Wand.

While many fans have assumed that the hose would attach to the connector that came with the wand it’s beginning to look more likely that the hose will not only handle the connection but electronics connecting into the back of the wand’s battery compartment.

At the moment this is entirely an assumption we hope to have confirmation once HasLab’s Ghostbusters Plasma Series Spengler’s Proton Pack hits the 7000 backers goal to become a reality and more advertising and information is released for the hose which as previously mentioned needs 9000 backers to be unlocked.

Ciesynski of North Smithfield Dies at 46,"Anissa R. Ciesynski of North Smithfield Dies at 46

Anissa R. Ciesynski 46 of North Smithfield formerly of Cranston died Thursday evening at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence.

Anissa passed away due to long-term health problems she bravely struggled with since birth. Anissa far outlived the diagnosis of her early years. She was determined to live a full and beautiful life and she did just that. Anissa truly knew that each and every day was a gift to be treasured and shared.

She was the loving companion of John DiGioia of North Kingstown.

Born in Providence she was the daughter of Russell Ciesynski of Warwick and the late Antonia Sanchez. She was the step-daughter of Patricia (Quartaro) Ciesynski of Warwick. She was raised in Cranston and was a graduate of Cranston High School East class of 1994.

Anissa worked as a personal nanny for several families then in the nursery department at Wal-Mart stores and at Grower Merchandising Services. Anissa was a member of Christ Community Church. Anissa believed in giving back and as part of her mission to do so she volunteered her time at Hasbro Children’s Hospital. She was also a volunteer at Roger Williams Park community garden. Anissa had a special knack with her green thumb and loved caring for plants. She also had a particular interest in beekeeping. Anissa participated in yoga as she found its methods soothing for her mind and body.

Anissa was talented at arts and crafts and knitting and crocheting. She made a number of hats and blankets and donated some of them to Hasbro Children‘s Hospital. Anissa was an amateur detective and mystery sleuth as she followed anything related to true crime stories. Anissa had a special place in her heart for her dog Chai. Inside that great big heart of hers was plenty of room for children as Anissa loved to be with kids of all ages.

Anissa unconditionally gave her love to her family and friends who were such a special part of her adventures throughout her life. Anissa will forever hold a place in the hearts of her many close lifetime friends. She will be remembered as a loving kind and caring person who gave freely of her time and talents to all those who were lucky enough to know her. Anissa’s life really was a shooting star that shinned for 46 years and will continue to shine down upon everyone who will forever cherish her memory.

Anissa’s family is grateful to the many doctors nurses and all healthcare workers who cared for her over the years. As a further testament to her selflessness and care for others Anissa‘s last act was to give the gift of life to others as an organ donor.

Anissa is survived by her father Russell Ciesynski and her stepmother Patricia Ciesynski of Warwick her companion John DiGioia of North Kingstown her sisters Kerry Jordan of Warwick and Amy Ciesynski-O’Brien and her husband Richard O’Brien of Narragansett and her brother Gary E.

Transcript

Health systems and hospitals have obviously been thinking about cybersecurity for years now: how can they ensure they are staying ahead of threats?

Well healthcare systems really need to work on a shorter strategy. Somewhere in the area of one to two years versus the historical three years. Information security is changing too much. The threats are changing and evolving. So you really need to focus on what's present and what's current. And the tools that are actually coming out really need to be focused on some of the other areas concern [like] really security operations. While we're all comfortable with information security and how it's running those plans procedures and policies really need to be looked at to make sure they're up to date and continue into the future with different regulations or different changes.

New tools that are coming out also have different synergies and interconnected components where you can actually have a toolset that all work together for a better cost. Really understanding the data that you have. Healthcare systems are known for unstructured data legacy data new data. It's really hard and difficult sometimes to find out who needs access to what and healthcare systems leaves that open. So really finding those out and finding the identities that really need to access that data is important. And then classification of that data for security purposes is really understanding who has access and what level of access they need. Is that data really secure or not?

Trending analysis right? Looking at the trends that are happening in the industry looking at what's happening on a landscape the threat landscape and then adapting to it really as it happens is something really important that healthcare systems cybersecurity professionals need to do. Within healthcare what I've seen also is partnership. You really need to partner with business units such as risk legal compliance and really get everyone on the same page.

Security is historically seen as kind of the wall right? It's a hurdle it's always an inefficiency. But now security is seen as something that can protect the organization from extended downtimes right? We've seen a downtimes in this industry longer than we've ever seen before. So you really need to protect yourself to be resilient against it.

And then emerging threats is really sharing data right? So knowledge sharing information security is really important to share what you see and then attach and connect to other sharing networks that share that information with you. So you can find that data or find the threat or find the vulnerability before it's really attacked or leveraged in the wild. And then also probably now more than ever is third-party. Third-party assessments and third-party partners is a vector where you see now they're going after the partner or the vendor or manufacturer to really attack them which in turn impacts your business.

What are the biggest threats or weak points that are vulnerable?

Honestly I think the biggest weak point and/or the biggest threat right of right now is really the increased amount of phishing attacks that are targeted to healthcare systems. Just our organization alone we receive 50 million emails a year on average and we only allow 4 million in. That's a huge vast number of what emails are actually identified as malicious. And those are just increasing as we go through. And that's really a big threat in the industry because that's the entry point for a lot of issues within cybersecurity right? So talking about ransomware and all these bad malware and viruses that can happen phishing is one of the biggest vectors.

Another area is really understanding like I mentioned before is identity. Who's accessing the data? So right now there's a big push for identity management where you really understand the individual and you identify and put a profile around that user where the user can only access certain things in the organization and nothing else right? Locking it down to specific targeted appliances or systems. And then on the same vein with identity is really passwords right? So the biggest weak point in healthcare is we have doctors we have nurses that don't want to use strong passwords. And it's an impact to their operations because they have to type it a lot. So really leveraging products like badge swiping you know tap-and-go type of systems and then also using changes with your passwords using password list checks where you check for previously pawned or previously breached passwords. Right now there's a publicly available database of over 600 million passwords where they're well known. You should not allow your healthcare individual's staff to use those passwords. Right? It's an easy it's an easy win.

Those are those are some of the I think the biggest threats I'm seeing. And then one other is really back to third party. We don't know what they're doing all the time right? It's a third party. You're putting your trust into another organization. And you signed a deal or a contract or an agreement based on what they're offering you and you can only understand their security based off of your initial assessment. So ongoing posture assessments ongoing checks ongoing scans of the environment and really holding your vendors accountable.",,,,,,,,,

Only some external brick walls and parts of the interior remain of the Samuel Keller House. The property is part of the Bucher Thal Historic District a set of buildings that date as far back as 1760. In 1987 the National Park Service entered them into the National Register of Historic Places.

The demolition was underway Oct. 14 when a nearby resident saw what was happening and notified local officials said East Cocalico Township Manager Michael Hession.

The property owner had no building permit to demolish the property Hession said. The East Cocalico Township code enforcement officer later arrived to halt the work.

By that time the home’s roof and upper half-story was already gone as well as a barn on the property according to Danielle Keperling executive director at the Lancaster County Historical Preservation Trust.

The partial demolition comes just three months after Conshohocken-based industrial real estate developer Exeter Property Group bought the property in July. The 84.5-acre property includes a 627000-square-foot building long used by Henry Schein Inc. as a distribution center.

Henry Schein is a major medical supplies distributor and has been a tenant there since 1998.

Exeter bought the property from Samuel Kirschenbaum and his New York-based SK Realty firm for $60 million in July.

Calls to Exeter for comment went unanswered.

A spokesperson for Henry Schein Inc. said the company was unaware of the demolition and has no involvement with it.

The 1848 home next to the warehouse is also in a historic overlay zone. That is a township zoning designation that requires owners to consult the Lancaster County Historical Preservation Trust on how to best preserve elements of any buildings being altered or demolished.

It’s unclear why crews began to demolish the property. Hession said he wasn’t aware of any development plans submitted to the township.

“I think they just thought they could do it under the radar” Keperling said.

The Preservation Trust’s executive committee has called for the township to impose any applicable fines to the owner for the illegal demolition according to Keperling and contract with architectural salvage companies to protect any remaining architectural items like doors moldings and brick.

The township’s board of supervisors will discuss the incident at their next meeting which is Thursday Hession said.

The zoning overlay is in part a recognition of the significance of the site to the area’s history Hession said.

“It’s important to the fabric of our community and it really tells the story of who we are and where we come from so that’s always important” Hession said.

The Bucher Thal Historic District is a rural hamlet that developed around a grist mill according to the property’s registration with the National Register of Historic Places. The homes in the area date as far back as 1760.

“Despite current development to the north and west the district continues to retain in good condition its rural character and its high level of architectural integrity” reads the description of the district in its 1987 submission to the National Register.

The Keller House is an example of a late federal-style home according the National Register’s architectural description. The Kellers also owned the mill across the road at the time the description says.

The National Register of Historic places adds an extra layer of protection for historic buildings but it doesn’t protect them from demolition Keperling said.

“The only thing that actually stops a building from getting demolished is an easement” Keperling said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
HSY,Hershey's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbnltYWcuY29tL2ludGVsbGlnZW5jZXIvMjAyMS8xMC90aGUtdGltZS10cnVtcC1wbG9wcGVkLWEtaGVyc2hleXMtYmFyLW9uLWEtbWluaW9ucy1oZWFkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Time Trump Plopped a Hershey's Bar on a Minion's Head,"Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Global News/Youtube

Former President Trump — who once proudly proclaimed that he didn’t change diapers because he refused to “act like the wife” in a marriage — is not known for his light touch with children. Perhaps the pinnacle of his ham-handedness with the younger set came in 2018 when he inquired whether a 7-year-old still believed in Santa Claus labeling the possibility as “marginal” at that age.

Trump wasn’t exactly a natural at Halloween either.

In 2017 at a holiday celebration featuring the costumed offspring of reporters Trump couldn’t help but crack a barbed joke remarking “I cannot believe the media produced such beautiful children” — which the kids surely appreciated. He also observed as he handed out candy to the kids “You have no weight problems — that’s the good news right?” That same year Trump rudely snubbed a kid in an inflatable T. rex outfit.

But the highlight of Trump’s Halloween antics came in 2019. The president was again distributing candy this time to children of military families when a tyke in a Minions costume approached. The Minion was clearly carrying a candy bag as one typically does when soliciting treats in a costume in late October. Yet Trump opted for what appeared to be comedic reasons to place a Hershey’s bar on the Minion’s head grinning as he bounced it off the kid’s noggin a couple times first. First Lady Melania Trump standing next to the president followed suit.

As was inevitable the candy quickly slid right off prompting Trump to emit what appeared to be a genuine laugh a rare sight indeed. The Minion appeared confused remaining in place for a moment as if to say “What the hell was that?” before shuffling off the chocolate bars still on the ground. Trump did not appear to notice or care about the tragic situation unfolding in front of him but thankfully an adult scooped up the candy and gave it to its rightful owner.

Yet the Minion lingered poignantly a few feet from Trump orange candy bag in hand its sole eye seeming to glare daggers at the president. Perhaps it wanted something more — an acknowledgment of what had just transpired? An apology? Maybe just a hug? As Don Jr. could have predicted none were forthcoming. Eventually the Minion gave up and left the scene.

For my brother it means donning his store-bought werewolf cape and hunting for Skittles and the occasional king-sized Hershey’s bar from our neighbors. For high-schoolers it either means sketchy basement parties or handing out candy to other people’s little brothers amidst the homework grind.

For Stanford kids it means dancing on tombs at “Maus” the traditional Mausoleum party. But it also means the annual Halloween concert put on by the Stanford Symphony Orchestra and the Stanford Wind Symphony.

Imagine it now: musicians in cow onesies cellifish (marine violoncellos!) undergraduates and graduate students (as babies and senior citizens respectively) and “Squid Game” violinists all of these costumed musicians playing a combination of movie soundtracks and classical music. Who wouldn’t pay to see that?

Not to mention the oh-so-clever transition enacted by orchestral studies director and music associate professor Paul Phillips who serves as the conductor of the Stanford Symphony Orchestra and Stanford Philharmonic. Phillips emerged dressed as the Front Man character from “Squid Game” then shed his black cape and stoic black mask for a second costume: a feisty pirate complete with luscious dark locks a bandana and eyeliner (the commitment!).

This event was not only the first in-person Halloween concert since 2019 but the first indoor student concert from the music department since March 2020. Thus it’s no surprise that there was a full house — advanced tickets were sold out to the public days before and a long line of students arrived the day of attempting to get seats. The concert was held on Friday.

The performances did not disappoint — featuring theme music from classics like “Pirates of the Caribbean” “Jurassic Park” “West Side Story” and “Star Trek” the event was incredibly popular for families.

The program also included contemporary music for this pandemic era — a piece entitled “Seven O’Clock Shout” by Valerie Coleman illustrated a COVID-19 phenomenon when New Yorkers would open their apartment windows at 7 p.m. every day and shout across rooftops to check in on each other. The piece even included audience participation with avid hollering between percussion and horn solos.

Overall the energy in the hall was impeccable — a sanguine blend of pop culture references camaraderie and giddiness.

There were also aspects that fell a little short — the first set began 20 minutes late for instance and occasional silences when section costumes were introduced proved there was some disorganization though they were mostly forgiven as awkward comedy. This general aura of light chaos fit in perfectly but that was partially due to the informal nature of the performance — these mistakes would have been more glaring had it been a concert dress type of event. Despite these small hiccups the event was still a complete hit.

The ultimate showstopper was the costume contest. Audience members decked out as wizards witches princesses and comedic stuntman Super Dave Osborne clambered onstage where they were judged based on level of applause from the rest of the audience. In the end a Tyrannosaurus Rex and Ludwig van Beethoven shared the grand title. In celebration of their victory the winners were invited to guest-conduct John Philip Sousa’s “Washington Post March.”

Recently The Platinum Card® from American Express had some big changes that saw quite a few new benefits being added to the card in addition to an annual fee hike. One of those new changes was the addition of an annual $179 statement credit towards a CLEAR membership.

But now it seems American Express is extending the same offer to select Amex cardholders through Amex Offers.

What Is CLEAR?

If you’re not already familiar CLEAR uses your biometrics like your face iris or fingerprint to verify your personal identity making it possible for you to speed through both airport and sports venue security.

This means that at the airport you won’t need to wait in line for an ID check. In fact you won’t even need to remove your ID from your wallet. After verifying your identity at a CLEAR pod a CLEAR Ambassador will escort you through the dedicated CLEAR lanes to the front of the line of the TSA checkpoint.

Needless to say this can be a big time-saver when traveling through the airport even for those who already have TSA PreCheck as having a CLEAR membership will allow you to jump to the front the TSA PreCheck line as well.

Free CLEAR Membership Through Amex Offers

So if you don’t already have the Amex Platinum card which cards appear to be offering a CLEAR benefit through Amex Offers?

As of now it seems that targeted cardholders of either the American Express® Gold Card or the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card are able to enroll in this offer.

As an Amex Gold cardmember here is what the offer looks like on your account:

Those who enroll in the offer and use that enrolled card to pay for CLEAR will get 100% back as a 1-time statement credit. Keep in mind that the offer expires on October 30 2021 but your CLEAR membership is good for 1-year after activating so you might want to wait until you have some upcoming travel to use the offer to fully maximize your free year of membership.

Hot Tip: Not a cardholder of the cards mentioned but still interested in a free or discounted CLEAR membership? Check out the best credit cards and elite programs for the CLEAR expedited airport security program.

Final Thoughts

Although a CLEAR membership credit feels like a bit of a slight to Amex Platinum cardholders it is great news for any Amex Gold card or Hilton Aspire cardholder who doesn’t already have the Amex Platinum card. If that’s you then be sure to jump on this great offer before it expires at the end of October so that you can get an expedited security experience at select airports and stadiums!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL21hZ25ldGljbWVkaWF0di5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC9yZXNwZWN0ZWQtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWhvdGVsaWVyLW5pY29sYS1tYWRkZW4tZ3JlaWctaGFzLWJlZW4tbmFtZWQtdGhlLW5ldy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtdGhlLWNhcmliYmVhbi1ob3RlbC1hbmQtdG91cmlzbS1hc3NvY2lhdGlvbi1jaHRhL9IBsAFodHRwczovL21hZ25ldGljbWVkaWF0di5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC9yZXNwZWN0ZWQtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWhvdGVsaWVyLW5pY29sYS1tYWRkZW4tZ3JlaWctaGFzLWJlZW4tbmFtZWQtdGhlLW5ldy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtdGhlLWNhcmliYmVhbi1ob3RlbC1hbmQtdG91cmlzbS1hc3NvY2lhdGlvbi1jaHRhLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nicola Madden-Greig has been named the new president of the (CHTA),"Wilkie Arthur

Freelance Court Correspondent

In the early morning hours of Friday the August 3rd 2018 Judah Gail was at the Five Dollar Bar situated at Lamont’s (Chicken) parking lot in Providenciales; also at the bar were several other patrons including a woman who was in company of some friends. During the course of the night and before the fatal shooting there was an altercation between a person known as “Madmax” and one “Sparky” on the corner of the food court at the establishment’s parking lot.

Gunshots were fired and the patrons hurriedly dispersed whilst some ran into the bar and laid low.

The case for the Crown depended to a large extent on the evidence of JC who testified under the cloak of anonymity and the pseudonym Jessica Cooper.

JC testified that shortly after the gunshots and the verbal altercation between Madmax and Sparky a red Mustang entered the parking lot to the Five Dollar Bar. It was then about 2:00am. She further testified that Madmax alighted from the red Mustang raised his shirt revealing a gun. She said then he approached Judah and asked him whether he thought his gun was a trophy and Judah laughed.

At the time Judah was sitting on a vehicle close by she testified.

Madmax’s vehicle was a distance of approximately 2-3 feet in front of JC’s vehicle and she said that she was about 10-15 feet away from the shooting incident.

Madmax told Judah “I will kill yuh *ucking a$$ tonight” and shot him once in his chest.

He then fired two more shots into Judah’s chest according to the eyewitnesses.

Madmax then got into the red Mustang and sped away from the scene. Judah collapsed onto a vehicle belonging to one Thea Musgrove and succumbed to his injuries at the scene.

Again that was 2018.

Kendall “Madmax” Dean was convicted on March 2nd 2020 of that crime and later sentenced to 30 years to life imprisonment for the Judah Gail murder. But Dean would appeal his conviction.

On Wednesday May 5th 2021 after having carefully considered the written submissions and having had the benefit of oral submissions the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal quashed the conviction and directed that a verdict of an acquittal be entered.

We relived that 2018 bold in public shooting death of Judah Gail the anonymous witness testifying along with the conviction sentence and subsequent overturned by the court of appeal to show and remind ourselves that this present case of Swann’s shooting death bears striking similarities.

This court correspondent can now report one of the jurors said in the first attempt to select a 12 member jury for this new trial that she was a juror on his first murder trial. She was referring to the 2020 trial for the murder of Judah Gail that took place in August 2018.

As a result of what was said by that potential female juror in the presence of the rest of jury in the waiting pool already having been selected for the trial the selection process was aborted.

The following week another attempt at staffing an unbiased jury resumed.

Police confirmed and revealed that in this new shooting death of JOSHUA SWANN on the evening of Sunday August 8 2021 – exactly three months and three days after Madmax had won his appeal and been released – that a bold gun crime in clear view of members of the public with reportedly many witnesses was carried out by Kendall Dean; facing charges of murder.

A number of the other witnesses who gave police statements refused to testify in the trial held in the Grand Turk Supreme Court as police believed and was investigating how one of the eye witnesses that were present at Swann’s murder scene and was sent off to the UK with his girlfriend and their young child came back home.

He “Karo Outten” having left the UK and moved to the USA for a while decided to traveled from the US and returned home was killed on Wednesday June 7th 2023 at ZaZa location on Five Cays Road.

He traveled home without the permission and knowledge of those closest to him including his girlfriend or child; it blindsided witness protection as well.

The girlfriend was called in as a witness in the trial; she testified from the United Kingdom unabashedly stating that she was not returning to TCI after what happened to her partner mere days after landing in Providenciales.

Dean was charged with the murder of Joshua Swann; described as ‘his own friend’ over what police said was a ‘theft of funds dispute.’

Police explained that they believed Swann was shot for missing funds he did not steal according to statements they had collected.

The 12 member jury heard the evidence and on Monday April 22 returned a conviction for Kendall Dean in the 2021 killing that claimed the life of the young man.

Kendall Dean is facing 30 years in prison on the murder conviction.

Will the judge in this new murder matter his Lordship The Hon Mr Justice Davidson Kevin Baptiste imposed the mandatory minimum of 30 years to life imprisonment on Kendall Dean? or will Mr. Oliver Smith KC Dean’s attorney persuade the judge to sentence his client to less than the 30 years to life imprisonment according to our TCI laws if finds exceptional circumstances?

A sentence of 30 years to life imprisonment simply means Dean will have to serve no less than 30 years before he can apply to be considered for parole. If having exhausted all his appeal options and fails he would be at age 56 before his first parole application can be submitted for consideration and no guarantee it will be granted.

The “life sentence” means he can remain at His Majesty’s Prison until he dies.

Prosecuting the matter was SIPT Senior Public Prosecutor Mr. Quinn Hawkins and was assisted by Ms. Katherine “Kate” Duncan also from the SIPT trial. They were granted special noticeable police protection at their hotel rooms and everywhere while conducting the prosecution of this trial in Grand Turk and heavily armed tactical unit officers were positioned at the court for the duration of the trial

Home Depot



Lance Allen is the decorative holiday merchant at Home Depot.

He oversees all holiday decorations for Home Depot including some of the company's most viral products.

This is what his job is like as told to Insider's Heather Schlitz.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Lance Allen the decorative holiday merchant at Home Depot. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I absolutely love Halloween. I loved fall growing up – the haunted houses the hayrides the movies. Now I'm responsible for overseeing the design of products buying of materials getting inventory to stores marketing and creating how displays look for Home Depot's holiday decorations including this year's Halloween decorations.

I swear I have the best job. What's more fun than giant skeletons and animated characters? I love the creativity and brainstorming to come up with the items that will create excitement.

I sneak into stores to watch parents bring their children to walk through sets because it's priceless to see the excitement on their faces when Halloween and Christmas decorations are set up in stores for the first time.

I've got a 7-year-old son who loves looking at the Halloween decor. When I show him images of designs and he'll tell me they don't ""look scary enough"" or that I ""have to change the eyes to make them scarier."" We're working from home. so he gets a lot of sneak peeks.

The fact that we wanted something 12 feet high was scaring everybody

For the 12-foot skeleton we were walking around a trade show trying to pick out our favorite items. We saw an oversized torso and it was a really unique item drawing everyone back. It was really expensive. Our team kept coming back to it and we knew that we wanted to create a whole skeleton that's oversized but price it so that customers could afford it.

A behind-the-scenes look at Home Depot's 12-foot-tall skeletons.

The fact that we wanted something 12 feet high was scaring everybody. Everyone kept trying to talk us down and push for something 10 feet or shorter but we wanted it to be so large that it would be the height of two grown men standing on top of each other. We didn't see anyone else in the market selling something of this size.

The skeleton required a lot of engineering work. One of the worst parts was trying to get it into a small enough box so people could handle it. The biggest worry was making sure it could fit into a standard pallet.

I love seeing how creative people get with the 12-foot skeleton. You know it's a fun product when everyone's playing around with it. Someone took the skeleton on the beach someone was driving home the giant skeleton on this little Mini Cooper and I saw another picture of the skeleton set up on a fire escape in Chelsea.

You never know where inspiration will come from

I took my family on vacation in Maine and I had them walk through a few cemeteries with me looking for the best gravestones so we could create those items in design. Our tombstones were amazing this year and they really replicate what you'd see in a cemetery so people can create their own replicas at home.

Home Depot's two 12-feet-tall skeletons.

I also go to haunted houses for inspiration and I sometimes go to multiple haunted houses each weekend. I've walked so many haunted houses that it's hard to scare me anymore but we always bring someone who we know will get scared because then we know if an item will click with customers.

I love taking stuff out of classic movies that people never get tired of. For Halloween we watch ""Hocus Pocus"" and classic slasher things like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th."" I've watched them at least six times each.







The neighborhood looks forward to us putting decorations up each year

I've got the normal 12-foot skeleton and the pumpkin-head skeleton at my house. I have a whole hillside covered with lighted jack-o'-lanterns which look great at night and I've got giant inflatable ghosts and a graveyard. Bigger is better with the decoration scene at my house.

Allen's house is decked out in Home Depot decorations and jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween.

This time of year I've got lots of development work and reviewing changes to a product for next year photos from factories and engineering specs. I'm also working through marketing and calls with companies we use to manufacture our products. There's also financial reporting about how products are performing and we use those numbers to make decisions for next year.

We're almost done with all our holiday decorations for 2022 but I keep that under close wraps. My least favorite part of the job is holding back and not being able to tell everyone what's coming.

I'd love to tell you but we keep it secret to make it exciting. But nobody will be disappointed in 2022 – I promise you that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL3RoZXRyaWJ1bmUvd291bmRlZC1jb21iYXQtdmV0ZXJhbi1nZXRzLWJhY2t5YXJkLW1ha2VvdmVyLXRoYW5rcy10by1tb251bWVudC1ob21lLWRlcG90LWFuZC1kYXYvYXJ0aWNsZV9kYTBjN2M4ZS0zNDE5LTExZWMtODE1Yy1iN2I2ZWE0MGUyNzguaHRtbNIBqAFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL3RoZXRyaWJ1bmUvd291bmRlZC1jb21iYXQtdmV0ZXJhbi1nZXRzLWJhY2t5YXJkLW1ha2VvdmVyLXRoYW5rcy10by1tb251bWVudC1ob21lLWRlcG90LWFuZC1kYXYvYXJ0aWNsZV9kYTBjN2M4ZS0zNDE5LTExZWMtODE1Yy1iN2I2ZWE0MGUyNzguYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wounded combat veteran gets backyard makeover thanks to Monument Home Depot and DAV,Two bereaved Colorado Springs-area families will receive the gift of a fully paid mortgage thanks to the efforts of a national organization d…,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlcnNldGlja2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyYXZlcnNlLWNpdHktYS1xdWFydGVyLWNlbnR1cnktYWdvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traverse City A Quarter Century Ago | The Ticker,"The world was a very different place just 25 years ago. In the mid-90s the worldwide web was coming into common usage with the debut of eBay and email becoming a familiar everyday tool. Seinfeld ER and Friends were all the rage on TV and Bill Clinton was reelected President in 1996.

In Traverse City the ‘90s saw a host of developments changes and newsworthy events and The Ticker explores all in our third and final Sunday lookback.

Grand Traverse Mall and the Horizon Outlet Mall opened in 1992. The National Cherry Festival was named a Top Ten Event by USA Today in 1997 ‘98 and ‘99. And in the last year of the decade the Traverse Area District Library opened its doors welcoming readers to its new location on Woodmere.

It was a quarter century ago that the State Theatre closed its doors. The screen remained dark at the downtown fixture for over a decade. During that time it was purchased by Barry Cole and the State Theatre Group with plans to convert it into a performing arts complex. Seven years later the State Theatre Group and Interlochen Center for the Arts announced a partnership to renovate the theater. The building wound up in the hands of Rotary Charities which donated the theater to the Traverse City Film Festival in May 2007.

Big box stores arrived in Traverse City in 1996 with the opening of the Grand Traverse Crossings shopping center on South Airport Road across from Grand Traverse Mall. Today Home Depot Walmart and Staples remain there; Toys R Us Office Depot and Borders Books are gone.

In 1996 Mike and Denise Busley opened the first Grand Traverse Pie Company. The two were tired of their corporate lives in San Diego and after visiting meeting and working with the owner of Julian Pie Company in Julian California they returned to their home state. The first Grand Traverse Pie shop opened July 19 with six employees. It added other bakery items and a café in 2000. Today there are 15 Grand Traverse Pie shops scattered across Michigan and Indiana with more than 300 “pie people.”

It was also in 1996 that Rick and Lori Dubro purchased Papa J’s & Roosters Chicken in Grawn. They changed it from carry out and delivery to a full service sit-down restaurant. Today their Rico’s Cafe’ uses the same pizza recipe as the one Dubro and high school friend Tom Griffin used when they purchased their first restaurant a pizzeria in Roseville in 1978.

Another downtown landmark found new ownership when the Traverse City Rotary Club sold the Park Place to Regency Inns Management Inc. of Sioux Falls S.D. and Milestone Hotel Investments of Minneapolis Minnesota that year. Rotary had used funds from its Rotary Charities operations to buy the hotel at a bankruptcy court auction sale six years prior and had reopened in 1991 after a year-long top-to-bottom renovation. Regency Hotel Management still owns the Park Place today; its own multi-million dollar renovation completed in 2018 included a 16000-square-foot addition and the removal of the famed dome.

Centre Ice opened in 1997 and has been going strong ever since helped by the Detroit Red Wings choice to hold the team’s pre-season hockey training camp there starting that same year.

Fires became major stories in the mid-90s. In 1994 a fire broke out in a pizza shop in the Hickory Corners plaza on Fourteenth Street. Despite the efforts of the Traverse and Elmwood Township Fire Departments the wind-driven fire destroyed the entire building.

The biggest story – and largest fire – erupted when a tire-shredding machine at Carl's Retreading in Grawn ignited nearby scrap tires on Dec. 29 1996. The tires were piled as high as 30 feet high in some areas and the smoke was visible for miles as some 750000 tires burned for weeks reaching temperatures above 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. Nearby neighborhoods were evacuated.

Multiple fire departments responded and the National Guard was eventually called in as well. Initial efforts to put the fire out used Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) but when that proved ineffective the fire was sprayed down with water and the burning tires were buried. The effects linger today as the foam left behind a PFAS plume which impacted nearby wells. Some affected homes have been connected to the Blair Township water system.

In January 1996 the region stepped into the nascent world of craft beer when Jack Archiable opened Traverse Brewing Company in Williamsburg. It was the seventh licensed craft brewery in the state (there are now more than 300) and it produced the first beer brewed in northern Michigan since prohibition. Many of the area’s leading lights in the brewing industry worked there including Brewery Terra Firma founder John Niedermaier Joe Short of Short’s Brewing Company and Russell Springsteen who would go on to found Right Brain Brewery.

Not far behind Mackinaw Brewing Company the city’s first brewpub opened in 1997. North Peak Brewing Company soon followed.

The Buckhead resident’s life story runs from a small city outside Augusta to joining Forbes’ billionaires list in 2018.

The 47-year-old Chestnut who did not respond to an interview request through Mailchimp attended high school in tiny Hephzibah Georgia where he met his future wife Teresa. He has said that his mom had a home hair-salon business and his dad had a military job. He attended Georgia Tech while she went on to become a nurse at such Atlanta hospitals as Grady and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta’s Hughes Spalding.

As Chestnut told Georgia Trend last year the Mailchimp story began in 2000 when he and partner Dan Kurzius lost their jobs. They started a web design company and in 2001 a little email marketing sideline for their customers called Mailchimp.

Driven by low pricing and high demand Mailchimp grew explosively by serving the small-business market. It became an icon of Atlanta’s burgeoning startup scene and was a sponsor of Atlanta Tech Village a Buckhead incubator. Along the way Chestnut joined the list of Buckhead billionaires along with the likes of Spanx clothing founder Sara Blakely and Home Depot co-founders Arthur Blank and Bernie Marcus.

Today Mailchimp is headquartered in Ponce City Market in the Old Fourth Ward — with a new headquarters under construction just down the Atlanta BeltLine on Ralph McGill Boulevard — and says it employs over 1200 workers.

For two decades Mailchimp had remained self-owned and shunned outside investors. That is poised to change with the September announcement of the Intuit acquisition which could close by mid-2022. Intuit is a California-based software company known for making the accounting program QuickBooks the personal finance app Mint and the tax preparation service TurboTax which has generated controversy about steering customers eligible for free filing to paid versions.

Mailchimp has said its products will remain the same and it will remain headquartered in Atlanta. Communicating the deal to customers — via email naturally — Chestnut said that “our mission to empower the underdog will always be our north star.”

In Buckhead the Chestnuts keep a low profile.

Kansas News Service

GARDEN CITY — Drivers approaching this cattle city on K-156 highway watch as the scenery changes from a patchwork of southwest Kansas crop fields pastures and feedlots to a collage of suburban sprawl.

The Home Depot stands next to the Dick’s Sporting Goods which shares a parking lot with the Old Navy that just opened this summer.

Across the street one of the town’s two Burger Kings serves up Whoppers in the shadow of the only Target store for a three-hour drive in any direction.

One hundred miles west Russ Baldwin makes a left turn off Main Street into an empty parking lot in Lamar Colorado.

“Behold: the former Burger King” Baldwin said lifting his hand from the steering wheel. “Home of the ex-Whopper.”

Plywood boards cover the drive-thru window. Next door the old K-Mart sits vacant.

Within minutes he drives past the airport that lost its last commercial flight in the early 2000s. Then the factory that used to be the town’s largest employer — until it abruptly shut down 15 years ago.

“That was pretty much the perfect storm” Baldwin said. “You’re sitting there going ‘What’s next a locust invasion?’”

Arrival marks milestone for Garden City

Just a few decades ago the two outposts were basically Kansas and Colorado versions of each other. But in 1980 the world’s largest meatpacking plant opened on the outskirts of Garden City. Almost overnight it became the fastest-growing part of Kansas.

Thousands of new jobs. Billions of dollars in new industry. A boomtown in a region that has lost residents for generations.

The plant’s arrival marked a milestone for Garden City making it the epicenter of the High Plains beef industry. And the city’s decision to open its doors to the thousands of immigrant and refugee workers who would accompany the plant has — at least so far — helped it escape the fate of the many surrounding towns that still see an unending exodus.

What’s more the diverging trajectories of Garden City and Lamar over the past 40-some years offer a glimpse at the knife’s edge between prosperity and decline in rural America.

That’s because the town that Garden City beat out to win the meatpacking plant was Lamar.

Two towns came to a fork in the road

Garden City and Lamar share the same river the same highway the same railroad line and the same Dust Bowl past. And through the 1960s they were roughly the same size.

But the population of Finney County — home to Garden City — has doubled since 1970. It’s now over 38000.

The number of people living in Prowers County — home to Lamar — has slowly slipped under 12000.

Larry Jones has watched the transformation of western Kansas’ largest city from his farm and cattle company that sits just outside of town.

“If you’d been here 20 years ago and looked at it” he said “you wouldn't recognize the town.”

Next door to Jones’ milo field sits the giant boxy structure that resuscitated Garden City: Tyson Foods’ Finney County beef plant. Inside more than 3000 workers — most of them immigrants and refugees — butcher 6000 head of cattle every day.

So what made Garden City and Lamar the two finalists to win this sprawling slaughterhouse in the first place?

As often happens on the High Plains it comes back to water.

Meatpacking plants historically operated in urban centers such as Kansas City and Chicago. But in the 1960s packers began to build plants in the countryside — away from big city unions and closer to cattle and the grain that fattens them through the last few months of their lives.

Around that same time the number of water wells drilled into the Ogallala Aquifer underneath this region skyrocketed. Those wells plus new center pivot irrigation technology allowed farmers to grow more water-intensive crops in places that get hardly any rain.

It created an ecosystem. The aquifer waters the corn. The corn feeds the cows. The cows supply the meatpackers.

“The way to add value to grain is to put it in an animal” Don Stull said. ”And the way to add value to an animal is to slaughter it.”

Choosing to deal with problems of expansion

Stull has tracked the beef industry’s impact on Garden City for more than three decades as a University of Kansas professor and author. He calls it the first of rural America’s food-processing boomtowns — quickly transforming from what he described as a white agrarian community in 1980 to one of the most diverse places in Kansas.

Yet the city’s metamorphosis came with growing pains. Rapid expansion brought plenty of challenges that it’s still dealing with like strains on housing health care education and social services. And because many of the plant workers were and are immigrants and refugees the type of growth the city experienced also worried some white residents.

“But if you ask anybody” Stull said “they'd rather have the problems of growth than the problems of decline.”

That’s why local leaders pushed hard to land the plant four decades ago — offering a “better package” than Lamar Stull said — to help secure the town’s future economically. And so far it has.

The beef industry now pumps around $2 billion into the county’s economy each year. The city has parlayed its growth into becoming the region’s retail hub regularly drawing shoppers from more than 100 miles away — including many from Lamar.

So what would Garden City look like today if the plant had been built somewhere else?

“Well” Stull said “look at Lamar.”

The other side of the equation

Russ Baldwin moved to Lamar the same year the meatpacking plant opened in Garden City. He now runs the local weekly newspaper.

As he ends his driving tour of shuttered businesses he rolls to a stop in a parking lot on the east edge of town. Weeds grow high along the cracks in the pavement.

The four-story building on the other side of a chain-link fence used to house a German bus manufacturer. At its peak it had roughly 600 people on the payroll. In 2006 it laid off the last 300.

“There were no more paychecks. Things were not being bought at grocery stores” Baldwin said. “People were scrambling and there just wasn't another job.”

Between 2000 and 2020 Lamar’s county lost 17% of its population.

It’s a vicious cycle that’s repeated across rural America. Having fewer jobs and businesses makes it hard for towns to attract and retain residents. Having fewer residents makes it hard for towns to get and keep jobs and businesses.

Today Baldwin described Lamar as a mix of people who want to help turn things around for the town and those who still cling to the fading memory of what the town used to be.

“There’s an element in town that reveres the status quo and doesn’t really want to see too much change” he said. “But you can’t stop change I don’t care how hard you try.”

‘Hindsight’s always 20/20’

Stephanie Gonzales wants to change that outlook. She heads the regional economic development organization SECED that tries to tempt employers to move to town.

“We have wide-open spaces so lots of places to put a business” she said. “You can’t beat rural America.”

She grew up in Lamar in the 1980s. Her parents brothers uncles and cousins were among those laid off from the bus-making plant.

Fifteen years later she said Lamar now fights the perception that the town doesn’t have enough people to make it worthwhile for businesses to set up shop there.

Meanwhile residents often drive over an hour to shop in Garden City essentially dooming the few businesses left in Lamar.

“The growth that (Garden City has) experienced could have ... really benefited Lamar” Gonzales said “had there been maybe some different mentality at the time.”

That mentality was a fear of change. Some people in Lamar were worried about the influx of immigrant and refugee workers. She said that kept Lamar from pushing harder to try to get the plant.

“We should have welcomed the diverse numbers of people” she said. “that would have been employed in a facility like that.”

County Commissioner Ron Cook said Lamar has missed out on several opportunities over the years — in addition to the meatpacking plant — because of those fears. So the town has had to adjust.

“We’ve learned. We’re more open to diversity and changing things in the county” Cook said. “I wish they were possibly a little more open with that back in the day.”

Lamar has seen some modest successes. A couple of data and call centers have relocated to town recently. A new $500000 sports complex plans to open early next spring. Residents will soon decide if Lamar will join Colorado’s lucrative recreational marijuana market.

But Wendy Buxton-Andrade another county commissioner said the loss of the meatpacking plant continues to haunt Lamar.

“Forty years later hindsight’s always 20/20” Buxton-Andrade said. “It’s a shame. … We missed a huge opportunity.”

Much of economy tied to Tyson plant

Yet in the High Plains prosperity is no given — even for Garden City.

“If the Tyson plant were to close tomorrow” said Stull the KU professor “Garden City would be in a world of hurt.”

It won’t close tomorrow. But Stull said it’s just a matter of time before this boomtown goes bust.

The end will come when the water — it’s irrigating those crops that feed the cows that end up in the giant slaughterhouses — runs out. Some meatpacking plants have already moved out of the southern High Plains in search of more reliable water sources.

And eventually — likely just decades from now — the Ogallala Aquifer under southwest Kansas will go dry parching Garden City’s beef industry along with it.

“Unless something can be done to turn that trend around” Stull said “ultimately western Kansas will look like eastern Colorado.”

Honeywell Home T9 Smart Thermostat

Smart thermostat

The Honeywell Home T9 Smart Thermostat allows you to control the temperature remotely through the Honeywell app. Furthermore the room sensors optimize comfort by detecting humidity and making adjustments to rooms where more people gather.

Features include:

Wi-Fi connectivity (works with 2.4 and 5.0 GHz)

Smart home integration with systems like Amazon Alexa Google Assistant Ring Cortana and IFTTT

With geofencing it is able to detect when you are home or away and adjusts to enhance efficiency and comfort

Notifies you when temperatures set are too high or low and when it's time to change air filters

It provides home energy usage reports helping you find ways to lower consumption

Simple installation with instructions on the Honeywell App

Your utility might give you a rebate for installing it

Works with the Honeywell app to provide unique accessibility when you're in or far away from home

Hardware or software requirements

The thermostat offers guided assistance during installation. How it works is you turn your home's existing thermostat off at the fuse box. Next remove its cover. It might involve gently pulling at its base or removing screws. This thermostat uses C-wiring. If your thermostat does not have it there are other options you can do using this guide.

From here the Honeywell app shows you how to connect everything. However if you are unsure about installation you can reach out to a Honeywell specialist who'll be happy to help.

Moreover the thermostat allows you to control everything through your home's Wi-Fi connection. Your connection can either be 2.4 GHz or 5.0.

The Honeywell App provides simplicity

Once installed you'll be able to take advantage of all the thermostat's unique features. Start by becoming familiar with the Honeywell App. The app is free to download through Google Play or Apple App Store. After installing it the app walks you through the setup. Using your home's Wi-Fi connection it can detect the T9 in your home.

The home app uses geofencing. It is a nifty tool that notices when you come home or leave for prolonged periods. It is beneficial in that the thermostat can set the temperature higher when you're away then lower it as you arrive home. In turn you receive a healthy mix of efficiency and comfort. And you could reduce your energy bills by up to 10%.

The app also sends you notifications when it detects a room is too hot or cold. And if your home's air filters become dirty it even sends you a reminder to change them.

Smart sensors balance comfort and efficiency

Using the base T9 thermostat alone allows you to control the temperature of your whole house. In saying that it won't provide the highest level of comfort or efficiency. Some rooms become warmer due to more sunlight exposure higher occupancy or they tend to be more humid. It is where these sensors come in handy.

Best of all the Honeywell T9 Smart Thermostat offers scalability from one to 20 sensors. It makes it suitable for a wide variety of house sizes and floor levels.

Also once you install the sensors in the rooms you want you can control them through the Honeywell App or the thermostat's interface. To demonstrate if you are hosting a game night you can adjust the temperature in the living room to be cooler to remove the humidity and extra heat.

At the same time you can keep your bedroom kitchen and other areas of your home at a higher temperature. That way your home's air conditioning unit does not have to work as hard giving you more efficiency and a lower energy bill.

Compatible with smart home systems

This thermostat pairs with several home systems like Google Cortana and Amazon. However it does not support integration with the Apple HomeKit. For the ones it does integrate with it offers voice-command capabilities. It adds one more convenience element to optimizing comfort.





Potential security issues

Smart thermostats like the Honeywell Home T9 can be vulnerable to hacking. To mitigate risk refrain from using the same password for everything including your Wi-Fi access. That way it makes it more difficult for hackers to access a backdoor to your internet through hubs like thermostats.

Current pricing

The Honeywell Home T9 Smart Thermostat retails for $169.99. You can add one room sensor for $199.99. You can also buy the thermostat with a C-wire adapter for $199.99.

Customer support

Honeywell provides a support hub on its website where you can also access how-to videos and troubleshooting. If your problems are more extensive they even include a list of retailers nationwide carrying their products.

Bottom line

The Honeywell Home T9 Smart Thermostat is a wise addition to your home. And when you pair it with the room sensors you receive the pinnacle of comfort and efficiency. While the price might be high (the thermostat and one sensor retail for $200) it could be well worth it when factoring in the geofencing energy audits and possible energy savings you receive.

Honeywell Home T9 Smart Thermostat FAQ

How long does the warranty last? Honeywell offers a two-year warranty on its T9 Smart Thermostat.

How can it lower my energy bills? When paired with a room sensor it detects when people stay in one room or pass by to another. From there the thermostat makes adjustments for rooms occupying more people while keeping other rooms in your home at the same temperature. Because of this focused approach your home's HVAC will not have to work as hard (provided it is in peak operating condition) resulting in lower energy bills.

Apple earned US$83.36 billion with an annual growth of 29%. iPhone sales contributed US$38.87 billion growing 47% year-over-year. Mac and iPad revenue also grew and came in at US$9.18 billion and US$8.25 billion respectively representing a 1.6% and 21.4% annual growth.

Apple has failed to meet its Q4 revenue targets. In its final quarterly investor call for 2021 Apple reported US$83.36 billion in revenue a 29% growth. The projected revenue for the quarter was US$84.85 billion. Explaining the drop in revenue CEO Tim Cook told CNBC” We had a very strong performance despite larger than expected supply constraints which we estimate to be around $6 billion. The supply constraints were driven by the industry wide chip shortages that have been talked about a lot and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia.”

All of Apple’s products including software and services saw annual growth. iPhone revenue came in at US$38.87 billion a 47% year-over-year increase. Services revenue increased 24.6% to US$18.28 billion. Mac revenue ended up at US$9.18 billion a 1.6% annual growth. Coming in at US$8.25 billion iPad revenue also saw a 21.4% increase. Other products including the Apple Watch and AirPods brought in US$8.79 billion after experiencing 11.5% annual growth.

The lower-than-anticipated Q4 numbers have resulted in Apple shares dropping 4% on Friday morning resulting in Apple losing its position as the most valuable company in the world to Microsoft. Microsoft now enjoys a market value of US$2.46 trillion beating Apple’s valuation of US$2.43 trillion. Microsoft's lead over Apple follows a strong earnings report that saw its shares rise 0.9%. The Windows-maker saw its quarterly revenue grow by 22% despite the ongoing chip shortage all thanks to the stellar performance of the Office business and cloud services.

This is not the first time that Microsoft has overtaken Apple. The company saw its value rise above Apple's in July 2020. However Apple retook the lead in the following month. Something similar can happen if the supply chain constraints ease to let Apple meet iPhone 13's strong demand.

Chevy isn’t the only company striving to pull even better performance numbers from the already impressive C8 Stingray.

The talk of the past week of course has been the forthcoming 2023 Z06 that will deliver 670 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque with its revolutionary naturally aspirated flat-plane crank LT6 engine that impressively redlines at 8600 RPM.



However longtime tuner Lingenfelter is teasing enthusiasts with even better numbers out of a regular Stingray in a recent YouTube video.

Lingenfelter says it has been working for more than a year on its own improvements to the Stingray’s stock LT2 V8 that already pumps out 495 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque. Their new system will apparently be shown to the world at the upcoming SEMA Show that runs Tuesday through Friday in Las Vegas.



In the past year Lingenfelter has already unveiled several bolt-ons that squeeze more horses and torque out of the LT2 – with its Performance Design pTR carbon intake manifold good for 19 horsepower the 95mm throttle body for 25 horsepower more and the Extreme-S Exhaust for another 19 wheel-horsepower and 15 wheel-lb-ft of torque.

To get it done Lingenfelter apparently has joined with Magnuson Superchargers and is teasing a supercharged system that will raise output to 705 horsepower and 667 lb-ft of torque – numbers that beat the forthcoming factory Z06 considerably.

A Spanish company called Silence presented the S04 their first fully electric quadricycle which complements their range of S01 S02 and S03 e-scooters. The four-wheeler uses removable interchangeable batteries as the aforementioned two and three-wheelers making it a practical solution for zero-emission city driving.

The S04 has a compact footprint with a length of 2.33 m (91.7 inches) and a width of 1.56 m (61.4 inches) allowing easy maneuvering and parking on the busy roads of big cities. The design is pretty modern with aggressive LED headlights and black plastic cladding on the integrated fenders and bumpers.

Inside there are two seats and a pretty decent 310-liter (10.9 cubic feet) luggage space. Equipment includes electric windows air conditioning and ABS while keyless entry and start are possible through the user’s smartphone.

The S04 will be available in two variants with different power outputs and battery capacities. The first will be classified as an L6e light quadricycle with an 8 hp (6 kW / 8 PS) electric motor a limited top speed of 45 km/h (28 mph) and a 5.6 kWh battery. This segment allows the S04 to be driven with a moped’s license from the age of 15 in Spain.

The second variant will be classified as an L7e heavy quadricycle featuring a 19 hp (14 kW / 19 PS) electric motor which allows for a higher top speed of 90 km/h (56 miles). The dual battery with a total capacity of 11.2 kWh is good for a 149 km (92.6 miles) range according to WMTC standards (the homologation used in motorcycles).

In both versions the batteries are removable so they can be replaced by fully charged ones at one of Silence’s battery exchange stations under a monthly subscription of €20 ($23). The battery pack is also attached to a trolley so the owner of the S04 can charge it at home or at work. This feature that was also incorporated by the rival ACM City One will come in handy for European citizens who live in flats without a dedicated parking space.

The Silence S04 is designed developed and manufactured in Barcelona Spain. The company hasn’t revealed an official market launch date but the first units are rumored to hit the road in mid-2022 with pricing for the base variant to start from around €7500 ($8695). Rival models in this segment include the Mobilize EZ-1 the Citroën Ami and Opel Rocks-e siblings the retro Microlino 2.0 and the ACM City One among others.

Silence’s e-scooters are also selling under the SEAT MO urban mobility brand. As a matter of fact the SEAT MO eScooter 125 is a rebadged Silence S01 while the SEAT MO eKickScooter 65 is a Silence S02. This could mean that the upcoming production version of the SEAT Electric Minimo Concept from 2019 might be closely related to the Silence S04 although this is just speculation at this point.

You know the way the world is going because you're happy it's happening.

Out with the old ways of doing things -- going to work at an office for example -- and in with doing your own thing. All the time anywhere.

I sense McDonald's understands this.

It seems to have realized that people coming to work at its restaurants greeting you as they take your order at the drive-thru and then quickly cooking your food is an outmoded concept.

Instead how about machines doing it all faster than humans ever could?

Well here's a little announcement the global burger chain made last week. McDonald's is now getting together with a very very famous name in tech in order to make the drive-thru more robotic and therefore more crowd-pleasing.

You may remember that McDonald's was testing robot order-taking at its drive-thru in Chicago earlier this year.

A customer experience video showed how glorious it is to be greeted by one of Siri's many cousins. You could tell she was really um loving it.

This was just an experiment right? They couldn't possibly be serious. Could they?

Well now McDonald's seems ready to expand this test to further-flung parts of our great nation. Ray the old ways are just a load of Kroc these days.

Oh I almost forgot to mention the very famous tech name with which McDonald's will now partner.

It's IBM.

Yes the IBM at which a Steve Jobs emissary once threw a large hammer in a famous ad. The IBM that used to be called Big Blue and now seems to be Big Intimidator of Little Companies.

Well McDonald's has just sold IBM its McD Tech Labs -- the engineers that are formerly known as Apprente -- so that IBM can take on the robot-driven drive-thru dream.

As CNBC reported McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski is delighted with how the robot-ordering drive-thru tests have gone. They apparently benefited customers and the remaining staff who still come to work at McDonald's.

Kempczinski offered: ""In my mind IBM is the ideal partner for McDonald's given their expertise in building AI-powered customer care solutions and voice recognition."" He added that the work now required is ""beyond the scale of our core competencies.""

Did you ever think your burger would come courtesy of IBM's Watson and friends? Of course you did. You've dreamed about this moment. The robots will never get it wrong. The robots will always be quicker. And the robots will enhance your emotional relationship with the brand.

That's what AI does. It strives for perfection so that you can offer it uncontrolled love.

Who needs a personal relationship when you can get your Big Mac thirty seconds faster?

Ultimately of course McDonald's is making a wise business decision. If speed is what's required the robots will surely provide it. Even if many of them still don't always grasp such nuances as an accent. (Don't worry IBM is working on that.)

And it isn't just about speed. Just think of how much more personal data may be collected as the AI begins to learn who you are and what you really really like.

But please don't worry about that. The companies insist: ""IBM and McDonald's are both committed to adopting AI responsibly by embedding ethical principles into AI applications and processes to build systems based on trust and transparency.""

Having seen the AI ordering in action I'm still not sure how tolerant I'll be of its essential inhumanity.

But perhaps the people I feel most sorry for are the employees of McD Tech Labs. Now they'll be working for the IBM Cloud & Cognitive Software division.

NEW DELHI: Eduguy Career Predictive Test (ECPT) is now live after its grand global launch. Keeping in mind the prevailing pandemic and lockdown situation the launch was conducted on the virtual platform Dr. Suborno Bose the CEO of Eduguy launched the ECPT in the virtual presence of students teachers and principals of prestigious schools and institutions of the world. Conceptualised by Dr. Suborno Bose and his team and designed with the help of advanced technology and expertise at IBM the ECPT promises to change students' lives by helping them find positive direction based on their aptitude interest and skills ""Sometimes children write all sorts of exams and choose something where they have qualified without thinking whether it is suitable for them or not. We want to change that mindset"" said Dr. Bose. ""If someone's skills is towards accounting engineering data science or cyber security we want to give them suggestions and not force it upon them"" he added.""I think all of us have gone through that predicament what is the right career this would be an invaluable tool that would enable all these kids at least to get some guidance"" said Sandip Patel the MD of IBM India and South East Asia.ECPT is the world's most technologically advanced career prediction method designed by IBM the leaders in AI and Deep Learning . The test helps people identify their own skills aptitude and interests and therefore determine the right career option. Students can takes the test after Class VIII or can also choose to take it after Class XII. The ECPT is a 120-minute test that includes three sections on Personality Aptitude and Interest. Every test is independent and it is necessary to take all three tests together to get best results. The AI-driven application instantaneously shows results. ECPT is also effective for professionals considering a job change.Eduguy under Indismart Digital started operations earlier this year bringing to students many path breaking and unique initiatives. The ECPT was designed to help anxious and distressed students decide their career choices amidst uncertainty and tension about their future. Where students are unaware of the vast career options open for them Eduguy connects them to over 14000 career options that students can pursue depending on their aptitude and skill sets.Eduguy is a course and specific stream counselling venture for the students looking for careers and related admissions through analysis made by its exclusive tools which is powered by AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) from IBM.Students undertake a psychometric test and based on their answers artificial intelligence suggests various courses or professional lines that fit best for the students based on their personality traits the Attitude Aptitude and Aspirations the application suggests 3 top options of career choices as per Artificial Intelligence with a scientific explanation as to why the AI has suggested those career choices. This is being termed as the biggest Education disrupter in recent times."

The high-end graphics card in particular being the most interesting of the two since we also get a glimpse of its PCB in close to final form.

Intel ARC Alchemist Graphics Cards Pictured Include High-End & Entry-Level Xe-HPG GPU Designs

MLID had already shared the first PCB shots of the ARC Alchemist high-end graphics card back when it was still in the early engineering phase. Earlier this month he also shared new renders showcasing the high-end ARC Alchemist shroud design in detail. Now MLID has leaked out both the high-end and finalized design for the Intel ARC Alchemist high-end graphics card featuring up to 32 Xe Cores and also renders of the entry-level part with up to 8 Xe Cores.

Intel ARC Alchemist High-End Graphics Card PCB Pictures (Image Credits: MLID):

Starting with the design the high-end graphics card features a design similar to the one we saw in the renders but now it looks more polished with reflective silver colors and two 9-blade fans that feature the proper Intel logos. The PCB has seen a major change since the last time we saw it in its prototype stage. Since this is close to its final design the PCB color has been upgraded to black and the size itself has gotten shorter. The power connectors are no longer on the back but on the sides of the card and the high-end variant utilizes an 8+6 pin configuration for a maximum power draw of 300W. The second fan mostly blows air through the aluminum heatsink as it extends beyond the PCB. There should also be a backplate on the card but that has not been shown in these pictures.

The entry-level Intel ARC Alchemist graphics card reminds me of the Xe-LP SDV. The rendered design is said to be based on the real thing which MLID can't show right now. The card features a compact design with a dual-slot form factor and may feature a single 6-pin connector to boot. The card offers four display outputs (3 DP + 1 HDMI). MLID also states that AIBs are desperate for a low-end graphics card solution to tackle the likes of the GeForce GTX 16 series which are expensive and the supply issues have made pricing even worse. With an entry-level ARC Alchemist graphics card it might just have the potential to disrupt the low-end desktop GPU segment.

Intel Xe-HPG 512 EU ARC Alchemist Graphics Card

The top Alchemist 512 EU variant has just one configuration listed so far and that utilizes the full die with 4096 cores 256-bit bus interface and up to 16 GB GDDR6 memory featuring a 16 Gbps clock though 18 Gbps cannot be ruled out as per the rumor.

The Alchemist 512 EU chip is expected to measure at around 396mm2 which makes it bigger than the AMD RDNA 2 and NVIDIA Ampere offerings. The Alchemist -512 GPU will come in the BGA-2660 package which measures 37.5mm x 43mm. NVIDIA's Ampere GA104 measures 392mm2 which means that the flagship Alchemist chip is comparable in size while the Navi 22 GPU measures 336mm2 or around 60mm2 less. This isn't the final die size of the chip but it should be very close.

NVIDIA packs in tensor cores and much bigger RT/FP32 cores in its chips while AMD RDNA 2 chips pack a single ray accelerator unit per CU and Infinity Cache. Intel will also have dedicated hardware onboard its Alchemist GPUs for Raytracing & AI-assisted super-sampling tech.

The Xe-HPG Alchemist 512 EU chip is suggested to feature clocks of around 2.2 - 2.5 GHz though we don't know if these are the average clocks or the maximum boost clocks. Let's assume that it's the max clock speed and in that case the card would deliver up to 18.5 TFLOPs FP32 compute which is 40% more than the RX 6700 XT but 9% lower than the NVIDIA RTX 3070.

Also it is stated that Intel's initial TDP target was 225-250W but that's been upped to around 275W now. We can expect a 300W variant with dual 8-pin connectors too if Intel wants to push its clocks even further. In either case we can expect the final model to rock an 8+6 pin connector config The reference model is also going to look very much like the drone marketing shot Intel put out during the ARC branding reveal. That reference design was leaked a while back by MLID too. There're also talks about a custom lineup being worked upon by Intel's AIB partners.

Intel ARC ACM-G10 vs NVIDIA GA104 & AMD Navi 22 GPUs

Intel Xe-HPG 128 EU ARC Alchemist Graphics Card

Then lastly we have the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist 128 EU parts. The top config is once again a full-fat SKU with 1024 cores a 64-bit bus interface and up to 8 GB GDDR6 memory. The cut-down variant will come with 96 EUs or 768 cores and a 4 GB GDDR6 memory featured across a 64-bit bus interface. The chip will also feature a clock speed of around 2.2 - 2.5 GHz and have a sub 75W power consumption which means we will be looking at connector-less graphics cards for the entry-level segment.

Performance is expected to land between the GeForce GTX 1650 and GTX 1650 SUPER but with raytracing capabilities. One big advantage that Intel could have over AMD and Intel is that with these cards they might enter the sub-$250 US market which has been completely abandoned in the current generation of cards. The GeForce RTX 3050 series only got a laptop release so far with RTX 3060 serving the entry-level Ampere segment at $329 US while the RX 6600 is expected to be AMD's entry-level solution for around $300 US.

This GPU will be very similar to the DG1 GPU-based discrete SDV board however Alchemist will have a more improved architecture design and definitely more performance uplift over the first-gen Xe GPU architecture. This lineup is definitely going to be aimed at the entry-level desktop discrete market based on the specifications.

Based on the timeline the Xe-HPG Alchemist lineup will compete against NVIDIA's Ampere & AMD RDNA 2 GPUs since both companies aren't expected to launch their next-gen parts by the very end of 2022. NVIDIA and AMD are expected to release refreshes in early 2022 so that might give Intel's new lineup some competition but based on current performance expectations the refreshed may not bring drastic performance differences to the lineup. The Xe-HPG ARC GPUs will also be coming to the mobility platform too and will be featured in Alder Lake-P notebooks.

The Apple MacBook Air (M1) and MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1) released late last year are two of the best laptops ever made so there's a lot of anticipation around these two laptops in particular. Especially because we saw some awesome Black Friday MacBook deals on these two devices even though they were only a few weeks old by the time Black Friday and Cyber Monday rolled around.

The Intel-powered MacBook Air (2020) and MacBook Pro (13-inch 2020 – released earlier in 2020 before the Apple M1 chip was even announced – are still incredible though and these two devices in particular saw some of the best Black Friday laptop deals all year thanks to the demand for the new M1 devices driving demand for these two laptops down during the holiday season.

What about this year though? This year's Black Friday shopping rush is coming hot off the heels of the launch of the Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) and Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) both of which are powered by the new Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max chips.

We already know that this is undoubtedly going to drive demand away from all of last year's MacBook devices which should make them prime targets for awesome deals in the coming weeks and on Black Friday itself.

So if you don't need a MacBook Pro device as powerful as the latest models or if you're really looking to keep things in the 13-inch range then this Black Friday is going to be a great time to buy one of last year's devices. And ditto if you want the portability of the MacBook Air but don't want to wait until next year's anticipated MacBook Air (2022) refresh.

But you'll have an important choice to make: Apple M1 vs Intel which MacBook model from last year is going to be the better Black Friday deal?

What to expect from an Intel-powered MacBook this Black Friday

The ongoing supply chain crisis is well on its way to becoming an internet meme at this point but it is absolutely a very real problem that could have a huge impact on Black Friday inventories – especially for high-tech goods like laptops that are almost exclusively made in Asia.

Particularly a huge part of that crisis is at major ports in America and Europe where cargo ships are idling offshore waiting for the room to offload their hundreds of thousands of containers packed full of merchandise.

Until retailers' relatively-small warehouse inventory is cleared out the existing cargo on the docks at these ports can't be moved out which need to move fast to make room for the cargo sitting offshore.

This means that older inventory or lower-demand merchandise is going to be aggressively priced in order to move it out quickly. In the case of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13-inch laptops this absolutely means the Intel-powered models from last year.

Since these models are effectively two generations old (if you count the new MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch devices) then retailers absolutely must move existing inventory of these two MacBook models in particular to make room for the more in-demand M1-powered models and the latest M1 Pro and M1 Max-powered laptops which are expected to be huge profit drivers for tech retailers this year.

How do you move a low-demand MacBook though? That's the question and given the supply chain pressure the quickest and easiest way to do this is to aggressively price these two laptops lower and earlier than you might otherwise have considered.

We're already seeing early-2020 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13-inch laptops approaching the kinds of prices we saw last year during Black Friday and the early Black Friday deals haven't really kicked into high gear yet. In the next few weeks we're expecting the price on these devices to drop lower to make room for the more profitable M1 M1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook devices.

Will M1 MacBooks offer better Black Friday deals than last year?

One of the biggest surprises from Black Friday 2020 was some surprisingly good savings on the then-brand-new M1 MacBook Air MacBook Pro 13-inch laptops and the M1-powered Mac Mini.

We honestly weren't expecting the prices on those to see any cuts at all but we saw anywhere from $50 to $150 knocked off those devices on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Now that the M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro devices are a year old do we expect to see more of the same or should we see better pricing than last year's Black Friday sales?

It's a tough question actually. We do expect that last year's deals pretty much set a baseline precedent that will be hard for retailers to ignore this year. It's almost certain that we'll see the kinds of prices we saw last year at least.

The question really does come back to that supply chain crisis we talked about earlier. While the MacBook Air (M1) and MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1) might be a year old they're still the latest models in these two product lines.

For the MacBook Air the M1 MacBook Air is the best MacBook Air you can get right now so it's not as likely to need aggressively low pricing to maximize profits on its sales during Black Friday. Black Friday deals on the Air will likely be $50 better than the best pricing we saw last year which was about $100 off the $999 MSRP for the entry-level MacBook Air configuration.

The M1 MacBook Pro 13-inch is a bit more of an open question since yes it's the best 13-inch MacBook Pro out there but there's an even better 14-inch MacBook Pro out there now as well.

This could seriously cut into the demand for the 13-inch Pro model meaning it will probably need much better pricing in order to entice customers to buy that laptop rather than go for the 14-inch version.

We saw about $50 to $150 off the entry-level 13-inch model last year and up to $200 off the most-specced out configurations so we'd expect as much as $400 off the high-end configurations and the smallest discounts coming in at about $150 on the entry-level models and everything in between.

Which Black Friday MacBook deal should you look for?

Now the question comes down to the Apple M1 vs Intel MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models from 2020.

The Intel-powered MacBooks are likely to see the biggest price cuts overall and we're expecting to see them much sooner than Black Friday even. By Black Friday itself the pressure to move those devices out is pretty much irrelevant since it's too late for retailers to use that inventory space for the M1 versions of either device for a higher profit.

Ironically there might be even better pricing on the Intel-powered MacBooks from 2020 before Black Friday than on Black Friday itself. If you want the best price on a MacBook the Intel models are your best bet and you shouldn't hesitate on grabbing a great deal now rather than waiting until Black Friday since you might even get a better price on those right now.

If you want the latest and greatest MacBook Air with the M1 chip then obviously Black Friday is going to have some great prices. That said we're already seeing similar pricing now that we saw during last year's Black Friday. If you see a new MacBook Air with an M1chip for $100 off holding out to Black Friday might only save you about $50 to $100.

If that savings aren't enough to hold off on buying a new MacBook Air right now then you probably should go ahead and take advantage of the early Black Friday MacBook Air deals you can get right now.

For Black Friday MacBook Pro deals though there are some great deals out there now but there are likely to be some significantly better ones on Black Friday and Cyber Monday so it might really be worth holding off until then if you don't absolutely need to buy a new MacBook Pro 13-inch this very moment.

In any case we'll be sure to bring you the very best Black Friday MacBook deals we find both early sales and during Black Friday and Cyber Monday so make sure to stay tuned to TechRadar for the very latest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9JbnRlbC1Db3JlLWk5LTEyOTAwSy1zd2F0cy1SeXplbi05LXJpdmFscy1hbmQtaTktMTE5MDBLLWF3YXktd2l0aC1ibGF6aW5nLUNQVS1aLXNpbmdsZS10aHJlYWQtYmVuY2htYXJrcy41NzYzODcuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-12900K swats Ryzen 9 rivals and i9-11900K away with blazing CPU-Z single-thread benchmarks,"A couple of CPU-Z benchmarks have surfaced showing the Intel Core i9-12900K achieving astonishing single-thread results. The new Alder Lake hybrid processor smashed its way past anything by an AMD Ryzen 9 chip and also demolished the i9-11900K. However it seems more than likely that such single-thread supremacy comes at a high power cost.

4 Reviews

Expert data-miner APISAK has offered up two more benchmark results for the Intel Core i9-12900K and they reveal single-thread benchmark results that are nothing short of spectacular. It wasn’t that long ago that the Rocket Lake i9-11900K was ripping up the rulebook on the same benchmark but the Alder Lake chip has destroyed its predecessor’s current CPU-Z chart entry. The i9-12900K features in two separate tests where it achieves an 800+ score in both runs. Considering the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X Ryzen 9 5950X and the i9-11900K are all in the chart with scores below 700 it is an astonishing appearance by the high-end hybrid processor.

Of course there are examples of Ryzen 9 5900X and i9-11900K chips achieving higher results than those shown in the CPU-Z chart but this is how things look at the moment: The i9-12900K managed 813 points and 834 points. Using an average of 823.5 points this would leave the Alder Lake part with these incredible performance differences: +20.75% over the i9-11900K +27.08% over the Ryzen 9 5900X and +27.28% over the Ryzen 9 5950X. The multithread results are also strong with the 8C+8c/24T processor scoring 11244 points and 11719 points in the two benchmarks – much higher than any of the other chips in the select group of CPUs using 24 threads (Ryzen 9 5900X @9544 points).

Considering the US$589 price tag for the Intel Core i9-12900K there would be high expectations for its 8 P-cores and 8 E-cores to deliver the goods – at least in terms of synthetic benchmark performances. But as most people interested in processor development and the CPU market will know this Intel single-thread superiority always comes at a power cost. The Zen 3 chips from AMD have a 105 W TDP whereas the Alder Lake flagship part starts off at 125 W base and can reach all the way up to a hefty 241 W under turbo usage (330 W has even been recorded for an overclocked sample). The result here is still a feather in the cap for the i9-12900K with Alder Lake looking like a sturdy offering from Intel.

With the announcement of 12th Gen Core Alder Lake CPUs Intel said farewell to the traditional nomenclature describing processor power namely Thermal Design Power (TDP). This value typically referred to as PL1 (Power Limit 1) has now been renamed to Processor Base Power (PBP). Intel CPUs have been known to notoriously go beyond advertised TDP which was often caused by the extended duration (Tau) of PL2 (Power Limit 2) by motherboard vendors to the point where they become overclocking and marketing features.

Intel is now moving away from TDP nomenclature in favor of PBP and Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) previously referred to as PL2. Which is now being used by Intel in marketing slides including official performance metrics. With all that in mind reviewers will have to ensure to use the correct mode when comparing with competing solutions to avoid comparing CPUs in different power modes. This could skew the results in favor of more power-hungry CPUs.

Detailed performance metrics are still under an embargo which is why we can only find not-so-accurate official performance charts compiled before Microsoft and AMD released an L3 latency fix for Ryzen CPUs on Windows 11 operating system. Luckily for us Wofstame who is Lenovo China Gaming Desktop Product Planning Manager mistakenly posted a chart featuring a comparison of Alder Lake CPUs in PL1 and PL2 modes in Cinebench R20 multi-thread benchmark. This demonstrates how much more performance would Maximum Turbo Power mode give to each of the three new 12th Gen Core K-series CPUs.

Intel Core i9-12900K: PL2 – 10180  PL1 – 7492  PL2/PL1 – 136%

PL2 –  PL1 –  PL2/PL1 – Intel Core i7-12700K: PL2 – 8677  PL1 – 6689  PL2/PL1 – 130%

PL2 –  PL1 –  PL2/PL1 – Intel Core i5-12600K: PL2 – 6551  PL1 – 5953  PL2/PL1 – 110%

According to those results a flagship 16-core Core i9-12900K would see 36% higher performance in PL1=PL2 mode compared to stock settings whereas the Core i7-12700K would be 30% faster. Interestingly the 10-core i5-12600K would only see a 10% benefit when forcing MTP mode.

Intel Alder Lake-S CPUs are now to launch on November 4th. Retailers have already begun taking preorders and reviewers are finishing their tests which should go live at the same time as sales. This however has not prevented even the US biggest retailers from shipping the CPUs early to customers who are now forced to wait for their Z690 motherboard to arrive.

First of all you can deny they even happened.

“In worst Apple event ever the tech giant becomes a parody of itself.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Daniel.)

Congrats to Phil Schiller whose 2009 Macworld Expo is apparently no longer considered the worst. Mashable takes time to criticize Craig Federighi for not delivering any dad jokes but can’t be bothered to mention the new chips much other than to make fun of the names. Very informative.

The other way is to deny the chips are even really that fast.

“Apple M1 Max: Less Impressive Than It Looks” (Tip o’ the antlers to J.)

Well it looks quite impressive so… maybe?

The author pulls one of the Macalope’s favorite tricks which is to compare a currently shipping product from Apple to a future product from a competitor in this case Intel’s Alder Lake processors. This not-yet-shipping chip you see will be as fast as Intel says — twice as fast! — as… uh some previous Intel chip. What other proof do you need? Meanwhile the M1 Max is only as fast as the second-lowest score for it on Geekbench. This is going very well so far. For Intel.

One could argue that the comparison above is a laptop CPU against a desktop CPU…

Because that’s literally what you’ve done yes please continue.

…but Intel will bring this CPU also to the laptop space.

And Apple will never make a desktop version of the M1 Max uh-huh.

Although the more common configuration in laptops would be 6+8 cores the removal of two cores is unlikely to drop the performance below the M1 Pro/Max.

So for Alder Lake we’ll use claims that it’ll be twice as fast as some preceding Intel chip even though estimates for laptop and mobile versions are more modest. And for the M1 Max we’ll use this one Geekbench score that is at best an outlier. (Of the 31 results on Geekbench 29 are in the mid to upper-12000s (matching Macworld’s benchmarks) and two in the mid-11000. Guess which one he uses.) Also let’s let Intel use a desktop CPU and make Apple stick to a laptop CPU. Because Intel will also ship a version for laptops. Which will be slower but still faster than the M1 Max based on the magical Intel unicorn hypothesis. In summary advantage: Intel.

Finally there’s the power consumption issue.

…I regard Intel as best-positioned to compete against Apple silicon going forward since Intel could use its in-house manufacturing (if executed well) as a competitive advantage to close the gap in power efficiency…

Yes Apple’s ahead right now but once again some future product from Intel will surely beat Apple assuming everything goes perfectly for Intel and Apple takes long lunches and then naps through the afternoon.

Oh also this is surely unrelated but…

I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of INTC either through stock ownership options or other derivatives.

Okay well that was fun.

Let’s just look at Anandtech’s conclusion in its review of the M1 Max:

The combination of raw performance unique acceleration as well as sheer power efficiency is something that you just cannot find in any other platform right now likely making the new MacBook Pro’s [sic] not just the best laptops but outright the very best devices for the task.

Will it beat all future products from other vendors? Of course not. Does Apple’s chip business face certain challenges? Yes. But right now this is the laptop to beat."

This compares to earnings of $1.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.65%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $1.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30 delivering a surprise of -19.25%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

International Flavors which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $1.27 billion for the quarter ended September 2019 missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.61%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $907.55 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have lost about 9.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.43 on $1.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.19 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the bottom 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has warned that “humanity is waging war on nature” and described this and growing inequalities as the main obstacles to achieving the SDGs. In the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019 he emphasized how closely all the goals are interlinked and called on the act global community to act more coherently and decisively.

The case for this has only become stronger since then with even more research pointing to how the impacts of climate change and degraded ecosystems jeopardize food security and access to water. The global COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the link between human health and environmental health while reminding us of how crises always tend to disproportionately harm already vulnerable groups.

Yet at least until now governments have not managed to respond in an effective and integrated manner. One example is the trend in the Voluntary National Review reports that countries submit to describe how they work to achieve the SDGs. A 2019 independent assessment of the voluntary reviews showed that only one quarter of them even touched upon the linkages between different goals. It was especially discouraging to see a downward trend with fewer and fewer countries aiming for policy coherence.

This means that countries continue to try to solve problems one by one even though we know that this approach will not be effective. Decision-makers lose valuable time and waste limited resources by failing to consider the interlinkages that science has made increasingly clear.

Things may however be starting to change. More governments and corporations are setting ambitious goals to reduce their carbon emissions as well as their impact on the natural world. SIWI helps different actors understand how these processes must be aligned and how restoring the water cycle is crucial to a more resilient future.

There are many inspiring examples across the world of how farmers city planners water utilities energy producers and others have started working with nature instead of against it. In the process they find solutions that reduce carbon emissions prevent soil erosion recharge water resources and protect against extreme weather events.

SIWI encourages more sectors to become part of this journey and offers practical support. But obstacles exist such as lack of knowledge lack of financing or obsolete practices that must be overcome. SIWI raises this perspective in different international processes to help the world change track. With a focus on freshwater aspects we can identify solutions that address more than one problem simultaneously and create virtuous cycles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMjIvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2hvcnRhZ2VzLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supply Chain Shortages: Your Questions Answered,"Computer chips. Exercise equipment. Breakfast cereal. By now you’ve probably heard: The world has run short of a great many products.

In an era in which we’ve become accustomed to clicking and waiting for whatever we desire to arrive at our doors we have experienced the shock of not being able to buy toilet paper having to wait months for curtains and needing to compromise on the color of our new cars.

Of far greater importance we have suffered a pandemic without adequate protective gear. Doctors cannot obtain needed medicines. In Alaska people are struggling to find enough winter coats. Airplanes are delayed while crews wait for food deliveries.

Why is this happening?

The pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain — that’s the usually invisible pathway of manufacturing transportation and logistics that gets goods from where they are manufactured mined or grown to where they are going. At the end of the chain is another company or a consumer who has paid for the finished product. Scarcity has caused the prices of many things to go higher.",,,,,,

The Buckhead resident’s life story runs from a small city outside Augusta to joining Forbes’ billionaires list in 2018.

The 47-year-old Chestnut who did not respond to an interview request through Mailchimp attended high school in tiny Hephzibah Georgia where he met his future wife Teresa. He has said that his mom had a home hair-salon business and his dad had a military job. He attended Georgia Tech while she went on to become a nurse at such Atlanta hospitals as Grady and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta’s Hughes Spalding.

As Chestnut told Georgia Trend last year the Mailchimp story began in 2000 when he and partner Dan Kurzius lost their jobs. They started a web design company and in 2001 a little email marketing sideline for their customers called Mailchimp.

Driven by low pricing and high demand Mailchimp grew explosively by serving the small-business market. It became an icon of Atlanta’s burgeoning startup scene and was a sponsor of Atlanta Tech Village a Buckhead incubator. Along the way Chestnut joined the list of Buckhead billionaires along with the likes of Spanx clothing founder Sara Blakely and Home Depot co-founders Arthur Blank and Bernie Marcus.

Today Mailchimp is headquartered in Ponce City Market in the Old Fourth Ward — with a new headquarters under construction just down the Atlanta BeltLine on Ralph McGill Boulevard — and says it employs over 1200 workers.

For two decades Mailchimp had remained self-owned and shunned outside investors. That is poised to change with the September announcement of the Intuit acquisition which could close by mid-2022. Intuit is a California-based software company known for making the accounting program QuickBooks the personal finance app Mint and the tax preparation service TurboTax which has generated controversy about steering customers eligible for free filing to paid versions.

Mailchimp has said its products will remain the same and it will remain headquartered in Atlanta. Communicating the deal to customers — via email naturally — Chestnut said that “our mission to empower the underdog will always be our north star.”

In Buckhead the Chestnuts keep a low profile. But their Chestnut Family Foundation does statewide work in support arts programs for youths.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9zdW4tYmVsdC1leHBhbnNpb24tbWFyc2hhbGwtZm9sbG93cy1zb3V0aGVybi1taXNzLW9sZC1kb21pbmlvbi1pbi1qb2luaW5nLWxlYWd1ZS1mcm9tLWNvbmZlcmVuY2UtdXNhL9IBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9zdW4tYmVsdC1leHBhbnNpb24tbWFyc2hhbGwtZm9sbG93cy1zb3V0aGVybi1taXNzLW9sZC1kb21pbmlvbi1pbi1qb2luaW5nLWxlYWd1ZS1mcm9tLWNvbmZlcmVuY2UtdXNhL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sun Belt expansion: Marshall follows Southern Miss Old Dominion in joining league from Conference USA,"Marshall has become the third Conference USA institution to join the Sun Belt Conference the league announced on Saturday. Marshall has joined Southern Miss and Old Dominion as part of a C-USA exodus and the three institutions shifting to the Sun Belt join six others that previously announced departures from Conference USA to the American Athletic Conference.

The Thundering Herd previously noted that they would not make a decision on realignment until hiring a new university president. Former Intuit CEO Brad Smith was announced as Marshall's 38th president on Thursday clearing the way for the school to make a decision.

""Marshall is well positioned for an exciting future in the Sun Belt Conference"" President-Elect Smith said in a statement. ""Our brand our athletic programs and our incredible fans earned this opportunity. This is a strong move forward for our university our athletes and our fans.""

Marshall has been a member of Conference USA since 2005 winning three division championships and the 2014 conference crown since joining the league. The Thundering Herd hired former Alabama associate head coach Charles Huff to lead the program in 2021. He is 4-3 in his first season.

Additionally sources tell CBS Sports that FCS power James Madison expects to join the Sun Belt after the Dukes' board approved a plan to explore FBS football. The decision requires state approval but is not expected to be an issue. Adding James Madison -- which was also targeted by Conference USA -- gives Old Dominion and Marshall a natural travel partner.

The addition of four schools would give the Sun Belt 14 football-playing institutions.

Old Dominion and Southern Miss publicly announced their decisions to leave for the Sun Belt Conference earlier this week. The schools will make the move no later than July 1 2023.

""While C-USA has proven to be an excellent home for ODU Athletics during our transition from FCS to FBS and we thank the C-USA membership and leadership for such an outstanding partnership the chance to enhance the overall athletic experience for the student-athletes fans and alumni of ODU in the SBC with regional rivalries represents the perfect opportunity for the continued growth and evolution of ODU athletic programs in our pursuit of national prominence"" Old Dominion athletic director Wood Selig said in a statement.

Old Dominion joined Conference USA as it transitioned to the FBS level during the 2014 football season. The program played football for a brief period in the 1930s but ultimately folded before restarting a football team at the FCS level in 2009. Bobby Wilder led the program from inception until 2019 posting a 77-56 record between FCS and FBS including a 10-win season in 2016.

The program has struggled since the breakout season however posting an 11-32 record since 2017. Former Penn State offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne took over the program in 2020 but ODU opted not to play football during the pandemic season. A move to the Sun Belt -- along with the potential rise of James Madison from the FCS ranks -- gives the Monarchs significantly more regional partners in the Carolinas and Georgia.

""We are thrilled to welcome Old Dominion University to the Sun Belt. ODU brings a host of strengths to our conference. They are competitive across all of their sports have a strong brand and are supported by a great fan base"" Sun Belt commissioner Keith Gill said in a statement.

Southern Miss announced it would join the Sun Belt Conference on Tuesday setting off a second wave of departures from Conference USA.

""Today is a great day for Southern Miss. I want to thank Commissioner [Keith] Gill and the Board of Directors within the Sun Belt for their faith in our institution and our ability to add value to the conference"" said Southern Mississippi athletic director Jeremy McClain. ""We are excited about adding our rich tradition of success and passionate fan base to a conference that values those attributes and look forward to working together to continue to elevate the Sun Belt on the national stage.""

Southern Miss has been a member of Conference USA since the creation of the league in 1995. The Eagles were once a nationally-relevant power under head coach Jeff Bower posting a 21-2 record in conference play from 1996 to 1999. The program has five Conference USA football championships under its belt with the last one coming in 2011.

It is interesting that the Sun Belt chose to add despite the fact that it hasn't been poached by other conference in the latest realignment wave. This round of realignment started in July when the SEC announced that it is adding Texas and Oklahoma out of the Big 12. The Big 12 responded by poaching UCF Cincinnati and Houston out of the AAC as well as independent BYU. The AAC then added six programs out of Conference USA -- Charlotte Florida Atlantic North Texas Rice UAB and UTSA.

The future of Conference USA is now severely in doubt. Dodd reported that Conference USA could be looking toward FBS independents like Liberty UConn and UMass or FCS programs that may be looking to jump to the FBS level.

""To say that [Conference USA] is not wounded would be to deny [reality]"" a source close to the discussions told Dodd.",,,,,,,,,

(GME) filed a SEC disclosure after Friday’s close noting the departure of Chief Operating Officer Jenna Owens after just eight months on the job. Owens a former Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) executive was hired in March as part of GME’s highly-publicized ‘digital transformation’. However the company has offered few details about the initiative since that time and her departure may be viewed as a setback encouraging shareholders to jump ship.

Investors have lost patience with Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) after 2020’s strong run-up contributing to a 14% year-to-date loss. Driver shortages escalating ride-share fees government catfights and heavy food delivery competition may have taken a toll in the third quarter raising odds for an aggressive ‘sell-the-news’ reaction after Thursday’s post-close report when UBER is expected to post a 16-cent per-share loss.

Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied out of a deep basing pattern at 16 cents in August topping out at 35 cents a few weeks later. It posted a higher low in September and bounced once again nearly completing a 100% retracement into the prior peak on Thursday. The coin has been pulling back since that time but strong support around 25 cents should ease selling pressure setting up a potential buying thrust that may complete a cup and handle breakout pattern with an upside target just above 50 cents.

Watch Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) on Wednesday because the passage of President Biden’s massive infrastructure bill may depend on Tuesday’s hotly-contested gubernatorial election in Virginia. The sector has been trading in tandem with acrimonious negotiations for several months now rallying 31% in the last 19 trading days. A Republican victory may be viewed as a mandate against big government spending potentially shifting moderate Democratic votes to the ‘no’ column.

Ford Motor Co. (F) joined the EV bandwagon this year announcing a series of initiatives to compete with better positioned rivals Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and General Motors Co. (GM). The automaker beat Q3 expectations and raised 2021 guidance last week adding to an uptick that’s posted an impressive 94% 2021 year-to-date return. However the stock is now approaching resistance going back to 2011 raising odds for a reversal and decline that could last for weeks or months.

The vehicle landed and the pilot stepped out of the craft inviting the two officers to travel the sky with him.

Fiction? Not according to Brian Irby archival assistant at the Arkansas History Commission.

In fact Irby told The Sentinel-Record this story was reported as something that actually happened and was published in the Daily Arkansas Gazette on May 9 1897.

""This was before we had airplanes. So this is something certainly different. Never seen before"" Irby said.

According to Irby's article in Encyclopedia of Arkansas it was a ""rainy evening of May 7 Constable John J. Sumpter and Deputy Sheriff John McLemore were riding horseback outside the city limits. As they were riding they saw a bright light in the sky that quickly disappeared. Puzzled but not too alarmed the two kept on their journey. Suddenly they saw the light again this time much closer to the ground. The two lawmen rode on to investigate.""

According to the account the men gave to The Hot Springs Sentinel ""they rode until their horses refused to go any farther. They dismounted and drew their weapons. They described seeing a cigar-shaped vessel sixty feet long. Walking around the ship were several men all shining lights while another filled a sack with water. Sumpter and McLemore asked the men what they were doing. A bearded man holding a lantern came near the policemen and told them that they were traveling through the country on an airship. The presumed pilot of the airship asked if the two lawmen would like to ride in the ship 'saying that he could take us where it was not raining. We told him we believed we preferred to get wet.' The pilot said their eventual destination was Nashville Tennessee. The lawmen let the airship go on its way.""

Irby said at the time no one used the term UFO or unidentified flying object and the flying vehicle was not attributed to aliens but rather some new invention perhaps by Thomas Edison.

In fact a description of the same flying machine was seen throughout the country starting in 1896 in California and continuing west. The phenomenon was referred to as the ""great airship mystery."" To make things more strange a similar flying vehicle was reportedly invented by a local Royal resident perhaps inspired by such sightings.

According to the Arkansas Traveler ""The Untold Story of the Hot Springs Airship"" by Larry Rhodes published in The Record 2000 by the Garland County Historical Society said ""Joel T. Rice postmaster of Royal Arkansas (1906) and his sons Royal and J.A. Rice had been interested in some form of lighter-than-air flight as early as 1896. A letter from Joel Rice's patent attorney dated October 26 1897 had advised him that the U.S. Patent Office will not allow patents on flying machines. His attorney's advice notwithstanding Joel Rice received his patent on his airship design on October 29 1909.

""By this time a full-scale dirigible had been already constructed and ready for its trials. Dubbed the Arkansas Traveler the prototype airship was between fifty and seventy-five feet in length. The undercarriage or 'car' was a large steel framework suspended from a cigar-shaped balloon filled with highly explosive homemade hydrogen gas"" the article said.

So on the eve of All Hallow's Eve the question remains are UFOs part of the Spa City's history? The truth may yet be out there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS9maWxtL25ld3MvZ2VvcmdlLWJ1dGxlci1kZWFkLXB1bXBpbmctaXJvbi1kaXJlY3Rvci1kb2N1bWVudGFyeS0xMjM1MTAxMTQxL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS9maWxtL25ld3MvZ2VvcmdlLWJ1dGxlci1kZWFkLXB1bXBpbmctaXJvbi1kaXJlY3Rvci1kb2N1bWVudGFyeS0xMjM1MTAxMTQxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George Butler ‘Pumping Iron’ Director Dies at 78,"George Tyssen Butler a documentary filmmaker best known for co-directing the 1977 feature “Pumping Iron” died on Oct. 21 of pneumonia at his home in New Hampshire. He was 78 years old.

Butler’s death was confirmed to Variety by his longtime companion Caroline Alexander.

Butler was born in England in 1943 and grew up in Somalia and Jamaica. He graduated from the Groton School in Massachusetts before earning a bachelor’s degree in English at the University of North Carolina and a master’s in creative writing from Hollins College. Butler became involved in the world of bodybuilding in the early 1970s by photographing competitions for Life magazine and The Village Voice.

Collaborating with author Charles Gaines the pair penned a book about the culture of bodybuilding. The success of “Pumping Iron: The Art and Sport of Bodybuilding” led to the making of the documentary “Pumping Iron” for which Butler and Gaines wrote the script. Butler also co-directed the film with Robert Fiore.

Centering on the 1975 Mr. Olympia competition “Pumping Iron” was a landmark look into the world of bodybuilding and launched the film career of Arnold Schwarzenegger helping make the five-time Mr. Universe winner a household name. “The Incredible Hulk” star Lou Ferrigno is also a subject in the documentary. Butler helmed “Pumping Iron II: The Women” a follow-up focusing on female bodybuilding in 1985.

Popular on Variety

“‘Pumping Iron’ the book and the movie drew the general public in to our strange little niche sport and brought fitness – and this Austrian with an unpronounceable name and a funny accent – to the masses” Schwarzenegger wrote in a statement on Twitter. “I was saddened to hear of George’s passing. He was such a talent he had a fantastic eye and he was a force for the sport of bodybuilding and the fitness crusade.”

Rest in peace to my friend George Butler. Read my full statement below. pic.twitter.com/TcMnsYTqSB — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) October 22 2021

Butler also established his own film company White Mountain Films in 1972 and produced many documentaries over the years focusing on a variety of subjects. He directed the 2004 documentary “Going Upriver” focusing on his friend and then-presidential candidate John Kerry. Most recently he served as producer and director of “Tiger Tiger” an IMAX documentary that follows the late big-cat conservationist Alan Rabinowitz set to be released next year. Butler worked on the film with his friend and collaborator Frank Marshall.

In addition to filmmaking Butler was a lifelong photographer whose subjects included inner city Detroit Jamaica and personalities such as Kerry and Schwarzenegger. He was also a dedicated conservationist and woodsman directing and producing ecologically-minded docs such as “The Lord God Bird” and “In the Blood.”

Butler is survived by Alexander his two sons his six grandchildren and his brother Richard.",,,,,,

(NASDAQ:JKHY) Just Reported Third-Quarter Earnings: Have Analysts Changed Their Mind On The Stock?,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. ( ) shareholders because the company has just released its latest third-quarter results and the shares gained 3.1% to US$169. Jack Henry & Associates reported in line with analyst predictions delivering revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models following these results.

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a notable 8.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 11% to US$5.75. In the lead-up to this report the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$181 suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. There's another way to think about price targets though and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Jack Henry & Associates with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$200 and the most bearish at US$170 per share. Still with such a tight range of estimates it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.

These estimates are interesting but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare both to the Jack Henry & Associates' past performance and to peers in the same . We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Jack Henry & Associates'historical trends as the 6.6% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 is roughly in line with the 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 3.7% annually. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.

With that in mind we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Jack Henry & Associates. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Jack Henry & Associates analysts - going out to 2026 and you can

Although it wasn’t love at first sight Kufrin […]

The California native 29 teased girlfriend Becca Kufrin via Instagram on Sunday October 31 after she shared footage of the couple’s Halloween costume.

The former Bachelorette 31 shared a clip via her social media page of the pair transitioning their everyday clothes into their couples’ costumes captioning it “Olé #happyhalloween #matador #bullfight.”

Jacobs who was dressed as a bull to his love’s matador replied to her post “Charging through all my red flags like” which seemingly referenced her previous callout about his alleged relationship dealbreakers.

The drama initially started back in June when Katie Thurston warned the Bachelor in Paradise season 7 cast not to date her former suitor who was accused of going on her season to become the next lead.

“I am nervous for any woman who interacts with Thomas honestly. He’s a smooth talker” the Washington native 30 said on the “Viall Files” podcast at the time. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he recycles some lines with me on some of these women. … Good luck to them. If he’s on Paradise I don’t care who he’s with I’m going to be like ‘Watch out girl.’”

Months later the former publicist shared a snap with Jacobs on the BiP beach in September before a social media user commented “This guy has ‘red flags’ written all over him.”

The Minnesota native replied “Red is my favorite color.”

The Giants drafted the 6-foot-6 259-pound Johnson in Round 4 No. 107 overall. Can Johnson develop into a more productive NFL player than he was as a college player?

“It’s really exciting for me because I think I have a super high ceiling. I think I haven’t even scratched the surface of what I’m capable of. I’m really looking forward to proving every day that I’m out here” Johnson said Saturday after the second of two rookie mini-camp practices.

“I think I have tremendous room to improve. I think I can grow a lot more than where I’m at right now. I think that’s why I’m so excited. I’m coming in here with a learning mindset. I want to develop respect from my teammates and my coaches. I think that’s going to help me continue to grow and improve. But I’m super excited to get to work and get going here because I think I have a potential to be a really special player here.”

The Giants certainly hope so. They traded for veteran Darren Waller a year ago hoping he could be a difference-making tight end. After one mediocre season in which leg injuries limited his availability Waller might retire.

That likely is part of the reason the Giants drafted Johnson.

“I think the big thing for me is consistency. Being consistent” Johnson said. “I’ll flash a lot of really good things on tape but it’s putting all that stuff together every single snap that’s going to help me reach my potential.

“Consistency comes from repetition doing it a lot and then being very detail oriented. Being very honest with yourself when you’re watching film and then having a coach that’s going to hold you to that standard every single day and not let the little stuff slide. I think that’s a big part of having consistent technique.”

Johnson understands that tight end is not a simple position to play.

“Tight end is a lot even at the college level. You’re just asked to do so much and that’s why I think it’s a great position” Johnson said. “Everything you’re asked to do it’s very unique. It’s not just a one-tool guy. The best tight ends are able to do everything. I think that’s really cool for a guy like me that I feel like I have the potential to do all the things that you can ask a tight end to do and be a guy that you can’t take off the field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaW1zb24uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC81LzEzL2JyZWFjaGVkLWxvY2stcHJvdGVzdC1oYXJ2YXJkLXBvbGljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police Say Harvard Affiliates Likely Cut Johnson Gate Lock During Saturday Protest | News,"Harvard affiliates used bolt cutters to cut a lock securing Johnston Gate in an attempt to allow roughly 150 protesters access to Harvard Yard for a Saturday afternoon protest the Harvard University Police Department said Sunday.

The incident occurred as Harvard affiliates Cambridge residents and activists from other Boston-area universities gathered on Saturday at the Science Center Plaza to protest the Israeli offensive into Rafah and condemn Harvard placing student protesters on involuntary leaves of absence.

According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano the protest was attended by “persons not affiliated and affiliated with the University.”

“Officers believe the lock was intentionally cut by someone within the Yard to permit access to the Yard by approximately 150 protestors” Catalano wrote in an email to The Crimson.

HUPD officers responding to a report of a cut lock found an abandoned bag containing bolt cutters inside the Yard on Saturday around 7 p.m. according to Catalano. Johnston Gate has been locked since late April as University leadership indefinitely closed the Yard to the public amid the ongoing pro-Palestinian encampment.

“There was no breach of the Yard” Catalano wrote in a follow-up email. “Officers immediately responded to the gate to secure it.”

Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine the student group that organized the encampment did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in a statement that “safety and security of the Harvard community remains the University’s top priority as we continue to manage the ongoing disruption resulting from the encampment.”

“The intentional step by what appears to have been someone inside Harvard Yard to cut a lock on the Johnston Gate during a protest is extremely concerning” Swain wrote.

While interim Harvard President Alan M. Garber ’76 previously said the University has a “very high bar” before it will resort to police action against the encampment the breach of a bolt lock during a large-scale protest outside Yard likely does not fall too far short of Garber’s threshold.

Interim Harvard President Alan M. Garber sits in a February interview in his office at Massachusetts Hall. Garber said he would not rule out police response to student protest but that it would need a high bar. By Marina Qu

HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay said in an April interview that while the University administration cannot simply request that the department arrest any individuals arrests may occur in the case of “significant property damage or physical violence at any level.”

The protest and the attempt to cut the lock comes amid rising tensions between protesters and administrators who have also taken disciplinary action against more than 60 students for participating in the encampment and placed more than 20 students on involuntary leave of absences.

Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine the group organizing the encampment said Friday they had rejected an offer from Garber to end the encampment and avoid being placed on involuntary leave. Hours later administrators sent letters to at least 20 students informing them they had been placed on leave and barring them from campus.

The encampment remained in the Yard as of Sunday evening despite a requirement that most undergraduates move off campus by midday Sunday. It remains unclear how administrators intend to deal with the encampment just days ahead of the University’s Commencement ceremonies.

During the Saturday protest Harvard Divinity School student Noa Sepharia said she would continue protesting despite being placed on leave.

“Hey Garber I’m still here — and I’m not going anywhere until Harvard divests from genocide” Sepharia said.

Swain wrote in the statement that there have been increasing reports from “frontline staff” of harassment by encampment participants.

“This behavior includes reports of staff being yelled at and encircled by protesters as they do their work as well as being confronted followed and subjected to audio and video recording” Swain wrote. “These reports are not only from staff carrying out ID checks and other work to enforce policies but also from staff while going about routine duties.”

Meanwhile the administrators have also attempted to film members of the encampment after they started to refuse regular ID checks. Dean of Student Services Michael Burke used his mobile phone to film protesters who used keffiyehs surgical masks and sunglasses to hide their identities.

The cut lock is the most recent instance of a breach of security into Harvard Yard. Since the start of the encampment the University’s security and facilities staff have reported multiple instances of attempts to breach gate locks and pry open the Yard’s gates according to Swain.

Last week police observed two College students passing supplies over a gate to the Yard to unidentified individuals whom they believed climbed over the wall.

In a separate incident verbal trespassing warnings were issued last Tuesday to four individuals who climbed over the 1870th gate according to HUPD police logs.

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL21heW9yLWpvaG5zb24tZmlyc3QteWVhci1pbi1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mayor Johnson on the record: The full Tribune Q&A as he approaches 1 year in office,"Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson sat down Monday for a wide-ranging interview with City Hall reporters Alice Yin and Jake Sheridan. Here is the full transcript of the interview lightly edited for clarity:

Q: I’ll start with something simple. What is your administration’s top accomplishment that you are most proud of in the past year? And what area do you think you could improve the most on?

A: Yeah so first of all thank you for taking time. We have the largest bond deal in the history of the city of Chicago $1.25 billion bond deal. We’re gonna build homes and create real economic development for people. It’s unprecedented investment. That’s what I promised I would do when I became mayor and we’ve done that.

A quarter of a billion dollars to address the unhoused crisis in this city; $100 million for violence prevention. We’re going to open up two mental health clinics this year. This is the result of course from two administrations ago shutting down mental health clinics. We abolished the subminimum wage in the city of Chicago. Black and brown women 100000 workers are going to get a raise. We have the most substantive paid time off in any major city in this country 1.3 million workers have additional days that they will be able to take off as a result of our work.

We hired 20% more young people for summer jobs. We added an additional $76 million on top of that. So we’re in a position to hire 28000 young people for summer jobs. First time in the history of Chicago where you have a community safety deputy mayor. It’s a big deal particularly when it comes to how we address community safety in this city.

So between the bond deal unprecedented quarter of a billion dollars for the unhoused $100 million for violence prevention of course abolishing subminimum wage of course creating paid time off for workers opening up mental health clinics the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago and we’ve done that within the first year of our administration. So I’m very proud that we’ve been able to accomplish everything that I promised that I would do when I ran for office. We’ve accomplished those.

Q: What do you see as the area that most needs improvement within your administration?

A: Well I mean look we’ve had 40 years of gross neglect and disinvestment within the city of Chicago right? And we’re talking about real severe disinvestment. I’m not sure if either one of you were here during the time in which schools were closed. It’s a very profound lasting impact that it has had on the people of Chicago. And when mental health clinics are shuttered that creates a lot of frustration that leaves a gaping hole right? And so part of my responsibility of course is to address the age-old systems of failure and to build a better stronger safer Chicago and that is something that I’m committed to doing. That’s what the people of Chicago elected me to do.

Q: If you could go back to May 15 2023 knowing what you know now about how the migrant crisis would unfold what would you do differently?

A: Well again thank you for acknowledging the fact that I inherited this crisis. When I was sworn in there were people who were sleeping on floors in police districts. They were sleeping on floors in airports right? You had no structure no order at the border and the governor of Texas was committed to creating chaos.

What we have done though as a result of that there are no more people sleeping on floors in police districts. We’ve cleared out the airports. We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million through our work of renegotiating contracts that I inherited.

Having reflected over the last year I wish that Congress would actually do its part and pass substantive immigration reform policies and alleviate this responsibility that has been placed on the backs of municipal government which it is not designed to do. And so that is an area that in retrospect had those types of investments been made — whether it’s the city of Chicago or Denver or New York or anywhere else in this country that Gov. Abbott has attacked and targeted — we could be in a much more — we could be in a better position as a country if the federal government would have acted.

Q: As a candidate you once said “Too often the politics of Chicago it forces communities to fight over one pie. My philosophy is: Let’s just make more pies.” As a mayor you have consistently said that Chicago was out of money for migrants while other governments as you just alluded to aren’t helping enough. Was your outlook back then perhaps too optimistic?

A: Again the $1.25 billion bond deal this is again the largest investment that we have experienced as a city. That’s 20 times the amount of dollars that we have made for the migrant mission within the latest investment. What it displays is that you actually can do both and I mean it’s a clear example of doing both. As far as my general optimism about the city of Chicago here’s the most important thing to remember: I came into office with a clear agenda to invest in people — a $1.25 billion bond deal a quarter of a billion dollars into the unhoused $100 million for violence prevention. You know we have established a brand-new office dedicated to those who are returning residents from jails and incarceration. It’s never happened before.

These investments could have been made two administrations ago it could have been three administrations ago. They didn’t do it. I did. And that’s why I’m optimistic in this moment because everything that I said that we need to do as a city together we are doing that. We’re investing in people. And we’re addressing age-old systems that have failed the people of Chicago for too long.

Q: We hear that (Deputy Mayor of Community Safety) Garien Gatewood and a violence interrupter were on the scene Saturday attempting to de-escalate a clash between CPD and (the School of the Art Institute of Chicago) protesters. Did CPD ignore the wishes of the fifth floor when they moved on the protesters anyway?

A: The most important thing here for everyone to remember is that I’m a strong advocate for the First Amendment and particularly protests. I’ve been a part of demonstrations multiple demonstrations. What we also need to make sure that happens is that we keep people safe and that’s the most important thing here.

And so the work to de-escalate is work that is ongoing. The work to keep people safe that’s the most important element here. And we’ve done both of those things. We’re keeping people safe. We’re protecting people’s First Amendment right. And when things get to be more intense we’re pushing for greater de-escalation.

Q: Was the final response the outcome — which led to dozens of arrests — was that necessary?

A: Well in some instances — and I’ve been a part of these demonstrations — in some instances arrests are part of the objective. I’ll say it like that. I’ve taken arrest before. It’s not unprecedented for demonstrators to take arrest. The most important thing though here is that the First Amendment? Protected. Keeping people safe it’s the primary goal and we’ve done both of those.

Q: Let’s talk about the pace of your personnel appointments. For example the ZBA (Zoning Board of Appeals) vacancy that you could have filled upon taking office ultimately cost your administration the approval of a homeless shelter in Uptown. Do you regret not acting sooner in that case and others?

A: Our appointments are working well. We have the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago; 60% of my administration are women. We have more brown folks represented in my administration more Black folks represented in my administration and we’re very proud of that. Whether it’s (Public Health Commissioner) Dr. Olusimbo “Simbo” Ige her leadership (Planning) Commissioner (Ciere) Boatright (Housing Commissioner Lissette) Castañeda the first chief homelessness officer in the history of the city of Chicago (Sendy Soto).

All of our appointments really speak to the values of our administration building better stronger safer communities. And we’re doing it in an equitable just way. And so we’re going to continue to make sure that we get it right and I’m very proud of the administration that I put together.

Q: Speaking of identity: During a Lunar New Year celebration you raised some eyebrows when you said the 11th Ward is one that “has been known for its racism.” I bring this up because some of your critics worry this language is alienating. Are their concerns valid? Or is your description of the 11th Ward fair and necessary?

A: Well I think that the entire city of Chicago certainly no one is going to deny the fact that we’ve had deep segregation in this city. And the fact that for the first time in the history of Chicago you have an Asian American representing the 11th Ward that shows that there’s tremendous progress that’s being made.

And so we have to address the harsh reality in this city that we are hypersegregated that there has been racism expressed in this city whether it be through school closures whether it be the shuttering of mental health clinics whether it be cutting off transportation stops and lines through various communities redlining the push-out of people gentrifying communities. You know these are real issues that we’ve had to face over the course of decades now.

And it’s incumbent upon all of us in this city to address racism that exists around the city while also making sure that we’re building capacity with a variety of voices and perspectives and experiences that can ultimately help build a more unified city. And that’s what we’re doing.

Q: The day after you won in April you told our colleague that you’ve never called 911 before which is a sentiment that other South and West siders have shared with me from time to time. But after ShotSpotter goes away 911 calls will presumably be the main alert system for first responders. Do you envision residents will have to adapt to calling 911 more to fill that gap?

A: Well let me just say where violence has been most pervasive particularly on the West and South sides of the city of Chicago these communities call 911 more than any other group and that’s well-documented. The challenge that we have in this city is that we have not had administrations that were committed to investing in people. I’m committed.

Look community safety is a top priority for me and it’s on the minds of all Chicagoans. Homicides are down in the city. Shootings are down in the city. The 35 most violent beats in the city of Chicago where over 50% of the violent crime occurs in those neighborhoods. Homicides are down 35% shootings are down 31%. The work that we have to continue to do to build a better stronger safer Chicago has to be very clear about how we invest in people.

If 911 is our response to community safety then we already have a failed strategy. That is not my strategy. I’m not committed to failing. I’m committed to investing in people and that’s what I’m doing.

Q: Mayor you’re a champion of the progressive movement here in Chicago. What has shifted in the mood and morale of the movement while you’ve been in office?

A: Well there’s a lot to be excited about. You know again paid time off. We’re talking about 1.38 million people. That’s part of the progressive agenda. We abolished the subminimum wage. It has its vestiges of course in slavery. So Black and brown women we’re talking about 100000 workers who are primarily the workforce of restaurants in particular they’re all going to get raises.

Treatment Not Trauma that policy had been lingering in the city of Chicago for years. We got it done within the first year of my administration. You know again this $1.25 billion bond deal right? We’re talking about $625 million dollars to build homes another $625 million for economic development and resources workforce development as well.

I mean this is a part of the progressive agenda that has been stagnant for now an entire generation. We’ve been able to move with expediency. This is an exciting time for the city of Chicago as we build a better stronger safer city through the lens of progressive politics through the lens of working people. And that we’re very proud of.

Q: That same movement was delivered a pretty big setback when Bring Chicago Home lost and its opponents sought to tie the referendum vote to you. Do you think that association hurt the referendum? And do you think you could have done more to back Bring Chicago Home and get it over the finish line?

A: Well we know there were some legal restraints that I had. I was not able to campaign for it. But let’s be very clear: We dedicated a quarter of a billion dollars to homelessness. We have for the first time in the history of Chicago a homelessness officer. Again this bonds deal was designed to build homes and we’re doing that. We’ve already built 100 affordable housing units since I’ve been in office.

There are another 700 that are in the pipeline as we speak. Look the same forces — and thank you because your publication actually is the source of it — the same forces that worked to stop (Cook County Board President) President John Stroger from moving this same agenda those same forces were in full effect to push back against the will of the people.

The bottom line is this it’s the most important thing: We have to deal with the homelessness crisis in this city and that’s what I’m doing. And so individuals or anyone of interests that are not committed to addressing the homelessness crisis perhaps they have to dig a little bit deeper and understand why they’re actually opposing that because the people of Chicago want us to address homelessness. So in other words their attack was against the people of Chicago.

Q: You have a reputation of being a pretty affable guy but also one common criticism of your administration has been struggles with relationships with some other governments City Council maybe the governor as well. How do you respond to that criticism? Do you think there’s room for improvement there?

A: Well look at what we’ve accomplished. Look at what we’ve accomplished together. Working with City Hall. Again the most substantive paid time-off ordinance in the country abolishing subminimum wage passing Treatment Not Trauma. We’re moving on the execution of plowing the sidewalks. We’re building affordable housing. We have a bond deal.

Working with the state and the county we put together an operation to address this migrant mission. We’ve done that together. Everything that I said that we needed to do that we needed to do it together we’ve accomplished that. And so my relationship with City Council with other executives I’m very proud of the work that we’ve accomplished and what we’ve done together.

Q: You campaigned on a platform of racial justice and unity. But on the floor of the City Council many aldermen especially Black aldermen describe a Chicago and City Council as more and more racially divided. Do you agree with that narrative?

A: Yeah well look 40 years of disinvestment. Whether it’s North Lawndale Englewood Roseland Austin Garfield Park every single crisis that we are dealing with right now I inherited it. There’s not one crisis right now that I caused. Not one.

And I’ve been on the front line fighting for education fighting for mental health services fighting to create more job opportunities for people and we’re doing that. Again we’re talking about the largest investment from a bond deal in the history of Chicago a $1.25 billion bond 100 affordable housing units that have already been built 700 right now in the pipeline.

This new Office for Reentry returning residents will now have a place where an entire department coordinates across city departments and sister agencies; $10 million in home repairs right now for families particularly on the West and South sides of the city of Chicago. And so we are addressing what we inherited. Forty years of neglect and within one year we have made hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and now the largest bond deal in the history of Chicago to address the neglect.

That’s what I was purposed to do: Build homes create economic opportunities for Black Chicago. There are more Black folks in my administration than in the history of this city. And no one else lost because of it. And 60% of my administration made up of women. I’m very proud of the work that we’ve done together.

Q: There’s no doubt that you’ve had a lot of big bold ideas in the agenda that you campaigned on. Those ideas also cost a lot of money. Out of all the other revenue ideas that you floated — a head tax financial transactions jet fuel hotels — which one do you think has the most realistic path to passing in this term?

A: Well the key is what do we ultimately want to do right? Do we want to build more homes that are affordable? Do we want to really create more pathways for our young people? Do we want to make sure that our public education system is fully supported? That’s the real question.

And the other question that we have to answer is: What happens if we don’t invest in those key areas? And so my approach is put the ideas on the table. You give people an opportunity to debate them to discuss them. And then we come to consensus together. Building a better stronger safer Chicago is going to require investments bottom line. I’ve made that very clear.

With the quarter-billion dollars into the unhoused the $1.25 billion bond deal the $100 million for violence prevention. Everyone says that they want to address these issues in our city the segregation the disinvestment. Turns out if you believe in something you’re willing to pay for it.

Q: But out of that process you just laid out what stage are you at in terms of deciding what to prioritize in that revenue package?

A: Those conversations are ongoing. You both know that we have a subcommittee dedicated to revenue. I created that for that very purpose. Look my responsibility in this moment is to bring people together and I’ve done it. I’ve done it consistently. And that’s why this subcommittee exists so that we can have these substantive conversations about what it’s going to take to right the wrongs that we inherited.

We’re talking about 40 years of gross neglect in the city of Chicago. I really want to just drive that point home — 40 years of neglect. It has caused tremendous harm to people. Do you know what that’s like to wake up and you’re not sure if your school is going to exist? Or if it’s fully funded? Do you know what it’s like to wake up and you’re unhoused?

I mean these are severe issues that the people of Chicago are facing and that’s why I’m dedicated to opening up mental health centers that’s why I’ve been pushing so hard for this investment around the unhoused. It’s why this $1.25 billion bond deal is a start in that right direction. And we’ve accomplished all of this in less than a year. Keep that in mind.

It has not even been a year yet. And everything that I said that I would do bring people together to build a better stronger safer Chicago every single platform point we’ve addressed it. And then to your question around our revenue sources there’s an entire committee dedicated to building an infrastructure of revenue that doesn’t place the burden on everyday people.

Q: Have you vetted or looked at potential replacements for CTA President Dorval Carter?

A: Well as you know discussing personnel issues I actually find that to be irresponsible and I’ve said that repeatedly. And so what I’m committed to doing right now is making sure that our ridership continues to go up which it has. We have hired more people which we’ve done that I’ve made a commitment to doing that. Our better streets for buses it’s the first initiative of its kind to build a better street signal sidewalk infrastructure. These are all investments that I have put forward in order to build a CTA that we can be proud of. And again as far as personnel matters I don’t discuss those publicly.

Q: Why?

A: Because it’s not responsible. Should your employer discuss individuals’ employment status out loud about who they’re going to fire and keep?

Q: In fairness though these are also employees not just of yours but of the city right? The CTA president also serves Chicagoans and they have a lot of questions about him and all of the appointments that you make.

A: Having questions about how we build a transportation system that ultimately meets the needs and demands of the people of Chicago those questions are welcome. Determining who I get to fire and hire I find that to be irresponsible and I won’t discuss personnel matters publicly.

Q: Out of all the current CTU demands — 9% raises housing assistance dual-language expansion sports and fine arts at each school more sustainable community schools abortion and gender-affirming care coverage and more — what do you already know that you could say yes to?

A: Well look my vision for public education has been made very clear. I want every single child to have what my children have right? We’re talking about manageable class sizes arts libraries librarians access to the trades. You know that’s what a public education system should entail.

Now I’m a firm believer in sustainable community schools and primarily because it gives you know real ownership of the school community over the actual school. And where there are areas where there’s alignment with my vision and what is being negotiated in the contract we’ll lean into that. And where there are areas that are disjointed we’ll have to work through it. We’ll just have to work through it.

The public education system in this city is another area where there’s been gross neglect. And my job in this moment is to lay out a vision that working families want in their school system. Now who better to help lay out that vision than someone who actually relies upon the school system? I’m the first mayor in the history of Chicago to send their children to the public schools in Chicago. I have a real vested interest in ensuring that every single family can feel proud of their school and that their school is fully supported and resourced.

Now what we also have to recognize is that the state of Illinois conservatively owes us the people of Chicago $1 billion. One billion dollars. And so I’m going to be working with our partners in Springfield to ensure that the people of Chicago get what they deserve.

Q: How does your lived experience as a CPS parent inform some of your education decisions and positions? Can you name a specific policy where you thought about your kids and made your decision?

A: Yeah just access to the arts. Access to a library and a librarian. When I taught in middle school the level of research that I asked my middle schoolers to engage in was pretty substantial. It was. I wanted them to really dig deeper into their lessons. Not to have any library or a librarian I could not imagine teaching at the time in which I taught and not have the ability to take my children to the library.

And that’s something as simple and as fundamental as a librarian I just want to emphasize this because sometimes I think we brush past that really fast. Just think about your own personal journeys: What if you did not have a library or librarian to reference as you developed your skill set to become the professionals that you are today? Children in Chicago are being denied a library and a librarian.

The second thing is class sizes. When the school was closed when I taught we inherited an entire school. Our class sizes ballooned. When you are a middle school teacher there are 35 38 children in your classroom and you literally have desks stuffed in corners it is almost — it is impossible to have full engagement with 35 38 children in your classrooms. Impossible. We managed it but it’s impossible. That’s the second thing.

The third thing is this: The number of children who experience trauma every single day because they were unhoused their parents are unemployed or underemployed and when that trauma shows up in your classroom I can tell you they’re not always thinking about the causes of the American Revolution or comma splices or the author’s main point. They’re thinking about food. They’re thinking about sleep. Those are the three areas that I can tell you emphatically as a public school teacher if you don’t address those dynamics you can’t say that you’re really in for the public good.

Q: If I can zoom in on a specific moment in your migrant crisis response. You know the Brighton Park base camp plan generated some of the biggest pushback you’ve seen against your administration. Looking back do you think that set you back with building trust on that issue? And is there a lesson to be learned from that?

A: Well again the chaos at the border has still not gone addressed. Part of the challenge in this moment is the frustration that the people of Chicago have we’re not giving enough attention to where that frustration is really based out of. You have a governor of Texas who was out of control.

We had 15000 migrants in shelters at its height. There are 8000 now. We’ve saved the taxpayers $200 million. Do you know not a bus has arrived in the city of Chicago since the end of December? Not one bus. Why? Because we put forth a structure that I promised that I would do to create a real operation that’s centered around people’s humanity.

Look I’ve said from the very beginning this mission is unsustainable for a local municipality. Because local government is not designed to address an international migrant crisis. We are being woefully neglected by the federal government and primarily because you have a former president who is controlling the Republican Party.

And so what I’ve done is created an infrastructure that is operationalized that is centered around people’s dignity and humanity under severe circumstances in which we don’t have control of what’s happening at the border. We continue to work hard to save taxpayer dollars while still making investments. All of the investments that I’ve already laid out I’m sure you probably can repeat them.

Q: If I could walk down memory lane one of the first things I remember you telling me right after George Floyd’s murder is “I wanted to destroy every bit of a system that would permit such a heinous crime.” Obviously as mayor now you oversee a large police department you have a security detail and you’ve had to stand behind the CPD seal at pressers. Has it been strange to grapple with this adjustment so soon after living through the rawness of 2020 and being a Black man?

A: Well the system that we are referring to is quite frankly it’s a system of oppression. And that manifests across the board. I just talked to you very candidly about how the education system has also been an oppressive system right? We know that from the Civil Rights Movement the movement really began to take form around the fight for public transportation.

Policing is no different than any other system that has been mired by an oppressive ideology. And it is still my desire to dismantle the oppressive structures that prevent us from experiencing justice.

Look law enforcement has a responsibility to serve people and to protect. But it is not the responsibility alone of law enforcement to address some of these other critical issues. We continue to rely upon the police system for everything and that’s a problem.

You know as far as grappling with the contradictions that exist within our society that’s something that we all work through whether you’re a woman a woman of color a Black man. Advocating for better structures that have historically left marginalized people behind that is the optimism that perhaps you speak of. If our people Black and brown people women would have given up on these systems you and I wouldn’t be here. And so we continue to push these systems to respond to the needs of people.

Look out for Jordaine Johnson!!!

Johnson who missed the entire outdoor season last spring with a broken toe left lots of smoke at Schools Stadium on Saturday when he produced one of the greatest and electrifying sprint triples in state history at the Super Essex Conference Championships in Newark.

Johnson a junior at East Orange Campus started off his day by running a meet record 10.53 in the trials of the American Division 100-meter dash No. 5 in the state this season. He followed that up by winning the 100 dash final in 10.70.

Johnson returned to the track 15 minutes later to finish first in the 400 in 47.91 No. 2 in the state this season. Later in the day Johnson completed the sprint trifecta with his best performance of them all when he blazed his way to a meet and Essex County record 21.04 which is No. 8 in NJ history for all conditions (there was no wind gauge).

How rare and remarkable is Johnson's triple!!!?

I can only find three other sprinters in state history who ran under 10.55 under 21.10 and under 48.00 in their high school careers!!!

Olympic gold medalist Dennis Mitchell a 1984 graduate of Edgewood ran 10.47 21.06 and 46.02. The late Mario Heslop of Franklin (Class of 2019) went 10.33 20.74 and 46.73 and Shamali Whittle of Hamilton North (Class of 2022) had high school PR's of 10.48 20.55 and 47.82.

That's some fast company that Johnson joined!!

And Johnson might be the first to ever go under 10.55 under 21.10 and sub 48 on the same day!! Heslop and Whittle accomplished their times on different days. Still checking on Mitchell.

Here's some more info on Johnson's 21.04 in the 200.

Johnson's 21.04 broke the Essex County automatic time record for all conditions of 21.22 that Maxwell Booker of Essex Catholic ran when he finished second to Danny Johnson of Rahway (21.03) at the 2000 Meet of Champions at Frank Jost Field in South Plainfield. The times by Booker and Johnson were wind-aided as they were run with a tailwind of 2.3 meters per second.

In case you're wondering the state record in the 200 for all-conditions is a wind-aided 20.51 (2.8 meters per second) by Antonio Tarantino of Paul VI in the trials of the 2018 New Balance Nationals Championships at North Carolina A&T in Greensboro N.C. The wind-legal state record is 20.75 that Shamali Whittle ran in the trials of the 200 at the 2021 Outdoor National Championships at Hayward Field in Oregon.

New offshore wind port and factory projects will be able to bid for £160m of Government funding announced by Boris Johnson.

The money which will come out of the £1.4bn ‘Global Britain’ investment fund announced at the Budget will go towards the development of port infrastructure capable of mass-producing floating offshore wind turbines and installing them at sea.

Wales’ coast was namechecked by Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng as holding the potential for more sites.

“The deep waters off the coasts of Scotland and Wales – which have particularly strong winds – have been earmarked as potential options for floating projects” he said.

He added that the new investment would put the UK in a leading position to capture the full economic benefit of this fast-growing industry.

“This investment will help to attract further private sector backing to boost our industrial heartlands” he said.

“It will create and support thousands of good quality jobs ensuring they remain at the forefront of the next generation of clean energy as we build back greener.”

The UK Government is aiming to create a gigawatt of energy through floating offshore wind by 2030 as part of efforts to decarbonise energy production.

The announcement came as Boris Johnson attended the G20 meeting in Rome which he will use to press world leaders to take further action on climate change during next week’s COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.

The announcement comes after the UK Government were urged in the House of Commons to devolve control of the Crown Estate which controls much of Wales’ offshore waters.

“Devolving powers over the Crown Estate would bring half a billion pounds worth of offshore wind and tidal stream potential under Welsh control – assets currently controlled by Westminster. Scotland meanwhile already has these powers” MP Liz Saville Roberts said.

The late David Tang managed to pull that off however and did so with aplomb. At the time of his death in 2017 The New York Times noted that Tang “was reputed to have the best address book in London” and noted his friendships with the likes of Kate Moss and Russell Crowe.



But living in a larger-than-life manner can also have its downsides. And now some questions have emerged about Tang’s own finances and whether — towards the end of his life — he was using company money to pay for personal business.



At Air Mail Harry Mount pondered Tang’s life in light of a new volume of memoirs by Algy Cluff for whom Tang worked in the 1980s. In Cluff’s book titled Off the Cluff he mentioned that Tang had “a disarming but ultimately destructive obsession to be not only a celebrity but also to be the peer of the grandest in the land.” Among the accounts of Tang’s behavior cited in Cluff’s memoir? Tang tipping a waiter $124000.



Cluff also contends that Tang “had been plundering the assets of various companies without the knowledge of the shareholders in order to fund his mythomaniacal life.” It’s a bold declaration and one that adds another dimension to what we know about Tang’s life and times.

The increasing focus on environmental social and governance (“ESG”) considerations at public companies including this year’s highly publicized proxy contest at Exxon Mobil Corporation (“Exxon”) has demonstrated the growing importance of understanding ESG and the implications it can have for investors and companies. Among the many ESG developments bubbling to the forefront of the markets in recent years is the desire of investors to see companies address social justice concerns. In particular shareholders have begun to request that companies conduct racial equity audits (“Racial Equity Audits”) which generally seek an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. We anticipate greater interest in Racial Equity Audits and similar initiatives in the upcoming proxy season and accordingly believe companies will be pushed to critically and objectively examine their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion to identify areas in need of improvement.

A. Overview of the ESG Landscape Today

ESG considerations can be broken down into three categories. First—environmental criteria which considers a company’s actions as a steward of the environment such as what steps a company is taking to address the depletion of the planet’s resources pollution and greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of climate change. Second—social criteria which considers how a company engages with all of its stakeholders (including employees customers and suppliers) rather than just shareholders including the treatment and diversity of its employees on the frontline management and boardroom levels the effects of a company on the surrounding community and whether a company is working with suppliers who share similar socially desirable values. Third—corporate governance which considers how a company governs itself and holds itself accountable taking into account the structure and diversity of a company’s board of directors the separation between management and the board of directors executive compensation equal and fair pay amongst employees and the extent to which a company or its management or board of directors are undertaking lobbying efforts making political and charitable donations or engaging in corruption or bribery.

With the increasing prominence of ESG awareness the market has also seen the rise of ESG-specific funds as a new form of investment vehicle. These funds have explicit mandates to make ESG-focused investments from mutual funds whose portfolio companies must score a high grade on ESG metrics to investment firms dedicated to ESG impact investing. In the U.S. market there are now over 600 ESG funds and exchange-traded funds for investors to choose from with approximately $161 billion in assets under management (“AUM”) which is more than double the AUM of ESG funds in 2010. According to research from Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) “ESG Funds were among the largest winners in 2020 taking in a record $60 billion in net flows nearly triple their 2019 total.”

In the meantime on November 9 2020 the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced the issuance of new final rules that expanded human capital management disclosure requirements applicable to SEC reporting companies. Since then SEC leadership has signaled that more comprehensive ESG-related disclosure could be mandated in the near future with SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee issuing statements earlier this year “directing the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings” and inviting input from “investors registrants and other market participants on climate change disclosure.” Former Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance John Coates also stated earlier in the year that the “SEC should help lead the creation of an effective ESG disclosure system so companies can provide investors with information they need in a cost-effective manner.” Based on these statements we believe there is a strong likelihood that the current SEC-mandated human capital management disclosures will soon be expanded to require additional disclosures covering environmental and other social initiatives and metrics further supporting a view that ESG awareness stewardship and reporting at public companies are here to stay.

As the ESG movement gains momentum and as the new wave of investors who factor ESG concerns into their investment decisions gain a larger share of the market companies are being advised to revisit their current policies and practices under the ESG lens. Companies that dismiss these concerns or lag behind their peers in addressing ESG matters may find themselves in the crosshairs of investors and proxy advisory firms or even state legislatures and federal agencies. On the other hand it has been found that companies that affirmatively adopt meaningful approaches to these issues may not only help progress environmental and societal goals but may also potentially see improved financial performance.

B. How ESG Ties Into Shareholder Activism

ESG considerations are becoming increasingly relevant to shareholder activists. This is because issues relating to climate change and the environment racial justice and diversity human capital and governance may influence companies at large and shareholder investment flows. Governance has long been a key focus of shareholder activists as corporate governance best practices including accountability of a company’s board of directors to its shareholders robust disclosure on executive compensation and independence of a board of directors from management have been found to have a readily apparent correlation with increased returns to shareholders. Recently however activists have begun to realize that social and environmental issues can also impact their investments in both negative and positive ways.

ISS and others have published a number of reports that have found that addressing social and environmental concerns correlates with companies either currently experiencing or having the potential to experience increased growth and profitability. As discussed in more detail below a company’s performance on ESG factors such as investment into renewable energy promotion of employee health and safety and contributions to the local community are pressing issues that can either benefit or adversely affect a company’s perception in the public eye operational execution and bottom line. Enhanced performance in these areas can lead to less scrutiny from environmental regulators increased customer loyalty more productive employees reduced employee turnover more lucrative business partnerships and increased profitability.

Improved ESG criteria is not a new area for activist investors. Shareholder activists have advocated for increased diversity in corporate boardrooms for a number of years. Concurrently with shareholder activists nominating an increasing number of diverse director candidates the voting policies of many institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc. (“BlackRock”) have been updated to reflect a desire to enhance boardroom diversity as have the voting guidelines of many prominent proxy advisory firms such as ISS. State governments have also codified ESG initiatives into law—California leading the charge with the passage of Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 which require a certain percentage of directors on the boards of public companies headquartered in the state be composed of females and individuals from underrepresented communities. Most shareholder activists are cognizant of the stance of institutional investors and proxy advisory firms on ESG issues and have increasingly incorporated ESG factors into their proxy campaigns.

C. Recent Push for Racial Equity Audits

Amongst the various ESG developments gaining traction in the markets is the recent push by shareholders for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits which generally consist of an objective investigation into a company’s practices policies and histories to determine such company’s impact on social issues and areas for improvement. In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020 and the subsequent civil rights movement and unrest many companies announced a number of initiatives and measures to address social justice issues including committing financial resources and reviewing their own policies and practices. However many advocates believe that without objective means to identify areas of improvement and monitor companies’ progress these commitments may be illusory and confirmation that these companies have in fact met their commitments could be difficult. Accordingly the 2021 proxy season saw an influx of shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (“Rule 14a-8”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits.

Just like its environmental and corporate governance counterparts addressing social concerns can be equally important to companies and investors alike as this can translate into among other things value additive results. For example following a racially-tinged incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks in 2018 where two African-American men who were waiting for a business meeting to begin were arrested the company performed a Racial Equity Audit which found that among other things racial sensitivity and the elimination of implicit biases are correlated to Starbuck’s core business plan of “creating an inclusive and equitable working environment as well as a welcoming ‘third place’ between home and work for customers.” In addition the W.K. Kellogg Foundation has found that “[b]y 2050 our country stands to realize an $8 trillion gain in GDP by closing the U.S. racial equity gap.”

II: Background and Overview

A. What Are Racial Equity Audits?

A Racial Equity Audit is at its core an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. Not only are Racial Equity Audits designed to help inform investors about their current and future investments from a social and financial perspective but are also intended to help companies craft their policies and practices to achieve their social justice goals.

According to certain proponents the point of a Racial Equity Audit is not necessarily to critique a company’s current platforms and efforts. Rather as argued by Trillium Asset Management (“Trillium”) a strong proponent of such audits the point of an audit is to embrace the notion that “if management is truly committed to make racial justice a critical element of its operations then in practice it can and should treat it like any other operations issue and audit it as such.” These proponents further argue that Racial Equity Audits should not be viewed as the end of a process for companies and/or shareholders looking to make a change; instead they can be a “stepping stone” to assist companies in developing and identifying a strategic plan to advance their goals.

B. What Impact Can a Racial Equity Audit Have on a Company’s Social Equity Policies and Practices?

The impact a Racial Equity Audit may have on a company may be felt in many ways. Racial Equity Audits can focus on various aspects of a company’s business including the treatment of customers at a company’s physical locations the diversity of senior management the targeting of products and even political contributions. Following an audit some companies have used the findings to develop a strategic plan to capitalize on opportunities to address racial equity moving forward. For example following the voluntary Racial Equity Audit conducted by Starbucks after the 2018 incident discussed above the company began requiring implicit bias training for employees setting public corporate diversity goals and implementing a number of other social initiatives. The public announcement of the Racial Equity Audit and related diversity equity and inclusion efforts appeared to not only rehabilitate Starbucks’ public image after the incident but helped the company become the “most popular restaurant stock on the S&P 500 with actively managed funds that are dedicated to ESG investing” according to RBC Capital Markets.

Racial Equity Audits may also find that a company’s existing policies and practices are not sufficient to address or may be perpetuating systemic social issues. For example in the supporting statement submitted by the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) to its Racial Equity Audit proposal included in the proxy statement for The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (“Goldman”) 2021 annual meeting of shareholders SEIU detailed Goldman’s alleged contributions to systemic racism. Specifically SEIU stated that “Goldman underwrites municipal bonds whose proceeds pay police brutality settlements.” Similarly Trillium on behalf of Christopher and Anne Ellinger submitted a Racial Equity Audit proposal that was included in Johnson & Johnson’s proxy statement for its 2021 annual meeting of shareholders in which Trillium expressed concerns with claims that the company continues to market its talc-based baby powder to “Black and Brown women after its talc supplier included the WHO’s ‘possibly carcinogenic’ label on shipments.” Proponents of Racial Equity Audits argue that a reassessment of internal policies and practices via such audits can identify the right levers to pull to begin to shrink these racial divides.

C. What Is the Democracy Case For Racial Equity Audits?

Civil rights advocates and proponents of social justice have long touted the moral and ethical considerations of closing the racial divide in America. Recently investors and companies have also begun to appreciate that positive financial returns are often associated with investing in initiatives working towards racial equality. Beyond the moral case and business case for conducting Racial Equity Audits and fighting systemic racism in general is the “democracy case” espoused by social justice advocates and that corporations can at times act more swiftly and have a more profound effect on current social issues than the government; therefore these advocates argue that corporations have a responsibility to address issues affecting our democracy. Racial Equity Audits can be designed to help identify if and where these issues exist within a company so that management can address them most effectively.

D. How Racial Equity Audits May Boost Financial Returns and Growth

Some studies have shown that “promoting racial justice can increase profitability and competitive advantage.” A study by McKinsey & Company found that implementing or improving racial justice policies can positively affect a company’s bottom line. As illustrated in the study companies with the highest degrees of ethnic/cultural diversity were 33% more likely to outperform their less diverse peers and companies with the most ethnically/culturally diverse boards of directors are 43% more likely to experience higher profits than their less diverse peers. A study by a Citigroup Inc. (“Citi”) global economist found that addressing racial disparities can have even broader macro benefits. According to this study “closing racial gaps would have generated an additional $16 trillion in economic output since [the year] 2000” and “by closing the various gaps between Blacks and Whites the U.S. could stand to gain an additional $5 trillion in economic activity over the next five years.” Racial Equity Audits could therefore prove to be a critical tool for companies looking to capture some of these unrealized gains.

E. How Investment Managers Especially Pension Fund Trustees Pushing to Address Racism May Be Consistent With Their Fiduciary Duties to Maximize Returns for Investors

A fiduciary’s duty is to act in the best interest of their beneficiaries and traditionally translates to acting to obtain the highest return on investment but it can be equally important that fiduciaries seek to minimize risk. Accordingly it has been argued that working to ensure that systemic risk in the marketplace is proactively addressed via for example a Racial Equity Audit is consistent with a fiduciary’s duties. Advocates of Racial Equity Audits believe that they are essentially intended to be implemented in furtherance of risk management and risk tolerance criteria that fiduciaries may choose to measure in order to protect their investments.

In addition there has also been a rise in ESG-specific funds as well as a growing number of ESG-specific products at mutual funds and other financial institutions. Beyond fund managers’ typical fiduciary duties to minimize risk and achieve positive returns these fiduciaries are explicitly mandated with making investments into companies that “aim to have a sustainable and societal impact in the world” based on ESG criteria or that “meet stringent environmental social and governance standards.” As the usefulness of Racial Equity Audits as a tool for ESG-conscious shareholders to measure a company’s adherence to ESG prerogatives becomes more mainstream it would be no surprise to see support for these audits grow.

F. How Professionals in the Area Believe Audits Should Be Conducted and the Importance of Independent Third Party Reviews

No two companies are identical. Every company has a different mix of products operations and services; therefore according to practitioners in the area it is important for participants in a Racial Equity Audit to identify the scope of the audit and benchmarks prior to conducting the audit. New York State Comptroller Thomas F. DiNapoli a staunch advocate of Racial Equity Audits has stated that such an audit should ascertain at least three things:

First whether a company’s policies practices and products are equitable and nondiscriminatory for employees customers and the communities in which they operate. Second whether any changes to existing programs or new measures or initiatives would help a company become more equitable and inclusive. And lastly whether a company has sufficient mechanisms in place to monitor effectiveness.

Practitioners also stress the importance of auditors using the right methodology including both quantitative and qualitative methods and for such auditors to review not only information provided by the company but to gather its own information. Accordingly auditors are encouraged to solicit information directly through surveys and interviews and to review historical records and a company’s performance against its peers.

Practitioners also believe that the audit process can be important for companies as a way to build trust with their stakeholders. To that end they believe companies should clearly disclose and explain the processes and personnel roles within a Racial Equity Audit and undertake to publicly share the results of the audit. Practitioners also stress the importance of identifying and engaging the “process owners” (e.g. the Chief Executive Officer Chief Legal Officer or Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer) as the persons who will actually drive the implementation of recommended initiatives. Advocates believe it is critical that the audit be conducted by an independent third party in order to ensure integrity and credibility throughout the process. Comptroller DiNapoli has observed that discrimination can be “deep-seated” within a company and “internal self-reviews have the potential to reinforce current structural impediments and biases” which is why he believes it is necessary for audits to be an independent assessment.

G. Which Companies Have Already Conducted Racial Equity Audits How Were They Conducted and What Were the Results?

Some companies have independently engaged in Racial Equity Audits or similar internal reviews usually in response to external pressures. As discussed earlier Starbucks undertook a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”) also conducted its own version of a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. The audit was led by Laura W. Murphy a civil rights advocate with help from a civil rights law firm. The Facebook audit began “at the behest and encouragement of the civil rights community and some members of Congress proceeded with Facebook’s cooperation and [was] intended to help the company identify prioritize and implement sustained and comprehensive improvements to the way it impacts civil rights.” The audit process included interviewing over 100 civil rights organizations several hundred more advocates as well as members of Congress. The aspects of Facebook that the audit focused on were informed by the aforementioned interviews which led to a holistic review of the entire company and not just a single aspect such as employment practices. The audit produced three reports which ultimately described how Facebook utilized the audit process “to listen plan and deliver on various consequential changes that will help advance the civil rights of its users” in a number of categories and also recommended implementation of specific action items including to (1) “continue to onboard expertise” (2) “build out the civil rights leader’s team” (3) “expand civil rights product review processes” (4) “require civil rights perspectives in escalation of key content decisions” and (5) “prioritize civil rights.” The thoroughness of the audit and the response and subsequent actions taken by the company have led to the Facebook audit being heralded by many as a big success.

H. Pushback to Racial Equity Audits

A number of other high-profile companies and financial institutions have been approached either by shareholders or civil rights advocates about conducting Racial Equity Audits. However not all companies have been as eager and willing to comply with these requests. As discussed further below several financial institutions including Citi JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman have resisted shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits stating that they would either fold such measures into their existing human rights assessments or that they didn’t believe it was the appropriate time for such an endeavor.

III: Rule 14a-8 Proposals—The Initial Stages of Advocacy

A. Shareholder Proposals

Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 shareholders may submit proposals to be included in a company’s proxy materials for its annual or special meetings of shareholders. Under Rule 14a-8 a company is required to include a shareholder proposal and related supporting statement in its proxy statement and list the shareholder proposal on its proxy card to be voted on with the company’s proposals if: (a) the shareholder satisfies specified eligibility and procedural requirements; and (b) the proposal is not excludable under Rule 14a-8(i). If the company determines that it is not in the best interests of the company to include a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal in its proxy materials it can (i) seek no-action relief from the SEC staff (the “Staff”) that if granted would allow the company to exclude the proposal without the threat of Staff recommendation of an enforcement action based on a procedural deficiency or a substantive exclusion under Rule 14a-8; (ii) take legal action in court to exclude the proposal; and/or (iii) negotiate with the proponent to withdraw the proposal. Shareholder proposals come from a variety of proponents including individual investors labor unions public pension funds shareholder activists and institutional investors and such proposals often focus on the environment corporate governance executive compensation and social issues. According to Forbes Magazine the past proxy season “set new records with at least 467 shareholder resolutions on environmental social and governance (ESG) issues.”

The Sustainable Investments Institute reports that 28 shareholder proposals dealing with racial justice had been included in proxy statements filed with the SEC as of April 27 2021. Certain of these racial justice proposals submitted by shareholders included proposals calling for Racial Equity Audits. For example the SOC Investment Group formerly known as the CtW Investment Group (“CtW”) a group that works with pension funds sponsored by unions affiliated with Change to Win a federation of unions representing nearly 5.5 million members submitted the following proposal to Bank of America Corporation for inclusion in its proxy statement:

RESOLVED that shareholders of Bank of America Corporation (“BofA”) urge the Board of Directors to oversee a racial equity audit analyzing BofA’s adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil rights organizations employees and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed. A report on the audit prepared at reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary information should be publicly disclosed on BofA’s website.

Similar Racial Equity Audit proposals were submitted by shareholders at several public companies during the 2021 proxy season with substantially the same resolution clause copied above but with different issues highlighted. In general Racial Equity Audit proposals ask the board of directors of a company to oversee such audits analyzing the company’s “business models—from policies to products and services—to determine whether they cause reinforce or perpetuate discrimination.”

B. Why Proponents Submit Racial Equity Audit Proposals

According to public policy analysts racial violence and the COVID-19 pandemic sparked an increase in Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals focused on racial justice. Several of the supporting statements for Racial Equity Audit proposals stated that:

High-profile police killings of black people—most recently George Floyd—have galvanized the movement for racial justice. That movement together with the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused the attention of the media the public and policy makers on systemic racism racialized violence and inequities in employment health care and the criminal justice system.

Proponents contend that Racial Equity Audits would help public companies “identify prioritize remedy and avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color” and would help a company’s board of directors assess such company’s “behavior through a racial equity lens in order to obtain a complete picture of how it contributes to and could help dismantle systemic racism.”

The chart below lists the proponents who submitted Racial Equity Audit proposals to public companies pursuant to Rule 14a-8 during the 2021 proxy season and the number of proposals they submitted:

C. Public Company Resistance to Racial Equity Audit Proposals

Boards of directors of public companies are “[i]ncreasingly . . . called upon to navigate the challenges presented by climate change racial injustice economic inequality and numerous other issues that are fundamental to the success and sustainability of companies financial markets and our economy.” After the May 2020 killing of George Floyd 66% of S&P 500 companies posted statements on their websites or social media accounts 36% made financial contributions to racial justice organizations and 14% stated in their communications that “Black Lives Matter.” While it has been observed that these companies were “quick to issue statements supporting Black Lives Matter and promis[ed] to do more to be responsive to non-white consumers employees and communities” most companies on the receiving end of a Rule 14a-8 proposal to implement a Racial Equity Audit have actively resisted such proposal by seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal from their 2021 proxy statements negotiating with proponents to withdraw their proposals and when the company had been unsuccessful with the foregoing recommending that shareholders vote against the proposals. In doing so these companies have argued that they have already taken measures to address racial justice such as “investing in Black entrepreneurs expanding credit and working to boost diversity within their ranks.”

Companies Sought No-Action Relief . Companies that sought to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals from their 2021 proxy statements by requesting no-action relief from the SEC argued that the exclusions set forth in sections (i)(3) (i)(7) or (i)(10) of Rule 14a-8 applied.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(10) a company is permitted to exclude a shareholder proposal if the company has already substantially implemented the proposal. The Staff has stated that “substantial” implementation under the rule does not require the company to have implemented the proposal in full or exactly as proposed by the shareholder. To demonstrate that they had substantially implemented the audit proposals companies argued they had (i) made pledges and commitments towards racial justice initiatives and made such information publicly available; (ii) issued ESG and/or diversity focused reports; (iii) issued press releases and public disclosures addressing racial inequality; (iv) implemented initiatives to advance racial equity; or (v) financially committed to racial justice initiatives and causes.

Rule 14a-8(i)(7) allows exclusion of proposals related to a company’s ordinary business operations. SEC interpretations of this rule provide that proposals that concern ordinary business matters but focus on significant social policy issues would not be excludable because “the proposals would transcend the day-to-day business matters.” In seeking to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals companies argued that these audits concerned day-to-day aspects of their ordinary business operations including: (i) “product sales and advertising;” (ii) “customer relationships;” (iii) the “nature of the company’s public relations messaging and communications with its shareholders and other constituents;” (iv) “workforce management;” (v) “relationships with suppliers;” (vi) “community impacts;” or (vii) “decisions regarding the products and services [the company] offers.” Furthermore these companies contended that the proposals did not focus on a significant policy issue that transcended their ordinary business.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(3) a shareholder proposal may be excluded from a company’s proxy materials if the proposal or the supporting statement accompanying the proposal is contrary to any of the federal proxy rules including Rule 14a-9 which prohibits a company from disclosing materially false or misleading statements in its proxy materials. The Staff has recognized that exclusion is permitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) if “the resolution contained in the proposal is so inherently vague or indefinite that neither the stockholders voting on the proposal nor the company in implementing the proposal (if adopted) would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty exactly what actions or measures the proposal requires.” Johnson & Johnson the only company to invoke Rule 14a-8(i)(3) during the 2021 proxy season to attempt to exclude a Racial Equity Audit proposal argued that the proposal was impermissibly vague and indefinite because “neither Johnson & Johnson nor shareholders would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty what actions or measures the proposal requires.”

The SEC considered the arguments described above to exclude the shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits and in each case the SEC did not concur with the company that the shareholder proposal should be excluded. Below is a chart listing the shareholder proposals submitted at various companies during the 2021 proxy season the proponent the regulatory basis to exclude the proposal invoked by the company and the SEC’s response to the company’s request for exclusion.

Companies Negotiated with Shareholders to Withdraw the Racial Equity Audit Proposal . BlackRock the world’s largest asset management firm and CoreCivic Inc. (“CoreCivic”) an operator of private prisons have agreed to conduct independent Racial Equity Audits after receiving shareholder proposals for such audits resulting in the proponents withdrawing their proposals. In the financial industry BlackRock’s decision distinguishes it from other financial institutions that have asked shareholders to vote against similar audit proposals and/or have sought no-action relief from the SEC.

Companies Recommended Voting Against Racial Equity Audit Proposals . Most companies who may have been unsuccessful in seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal or in negotiating a resolution with a shareholder to withdraw the proposal have recommended that shareholders vote against the proposals. These companies have asserted that they disagree with the “approach” of Racial Equity Audit proposals but are “aligned with [their] stated goal of addressing racial inequity in the financial sector.”

For example the board of directors of Citi recommended a vote against the Racial Equity Audit proposal included in its 2021 proxy statement noting that “[a]s recently as September 2020 Citi released a 104 page report on the economic cost of Black inequality in the United States titled Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps” and said its efforts on these issues are available to the public. Wells Fargo Co. (“Wells Fargo”) said it is conducting a “human rights impact assessment” and that it will update its Human Rights Statement to better align with the expectations of companies under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Wells Fargo also said it is making efforts toward “expanding [its] diversity and inclusion commitments with a focus on hiring promotions and turnover with increased accountability across all of those areas and [is] taking specific actions in support of these commitments.” The board of directors of Goldman recommended that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on a Racial Equity Audit saying it has taken additional steps toward racial equity in the past year including assessing its “shortcomings” and committing to hiring more analysts from “historically Black colleges and universities while maintaining [its] existing programs focused on other diverse populations.” Goldman also pointed out that it is “[b]uilding upon more than $200 million of grants in minority communities and to minority-owned businesses over the past two decades” and “in 2020 [Goldman] created the Fund for Racial Equity to support the vital work of leading nonprofits that are addressing racial injustice structural inequity and economic disparity which has committed $10 million from GS Gives in addition to matching employee contributions to recipient organizations.”

D. Proxy Advisors’ Positions on Racial Equity Audits

The two leading proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis & Co. LLC (“Glass Lewis”) have generally taken opposing views on Racial Equity Audits. According to Bloomberg Glass Lewis “has broadly said conducting the audits would help companies reduce risks of high-profile controversies that may result in customer and employee attrition regulatory inquiries and significant fines” and that “‘[g]iven broad societal changes it is particularly important for consumer-facing companies’ which depend on their customers’ trust and loyalty ‘to address issues of racial equity.’” On the other hand according to Bloomberg ISS has stated that “racial audits aren’t warranted because companies are taking ‘sufficient meaningful actions’ to address racial inequities such as expanding opportunities for people and communities of color as well as improving the diversity and inclusion of its workforces.” The following chart sets forth the recommendations ISS and Glass Lewis made with respect to each Racial Equity Audit proposal in the 2021 proxy season:

E. Amazon’S Response to a Racial Equity Audit Proposal—A Case Study

During the 2021 proxy season Amazon.com Inc. (“Amazon”) faced a shareholder proposal requesting the company to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. The proposal was submitted by Comptroller DiNapoli as trustee of New York State’s Common Retirement Fund for public employees which owns shares in Amazon. Comptroller DiNapoli was joined by other Amazon shareholders in requesting Amazon’s board of directors to commission a Racial Equity Audit that would analyze two main issues: (1) Amazon’s “impacts on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” and (2) the “impacts of those issues on Amazon’s business.” In response Amazon sent a letter to the SEC seeking to exclude the proposal from its 2021 proxy materials. Amazon argued that regardless of the proposal being “framed in the form of a request for a report” this did not change the fact that the “subject matter of the proposed report is within [Amazon’s] ordinary business” and thus excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

Amazon argued the proposal’s call to review its impact “on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” is a “broad survey on the impact of the Company’s policies practices products and services on societal issues” which implicates “routine business issues” such as “the products and services that the Company offers to its customers the Company’s business practices and operations the Company’s strategic decisions and the Company’s choice of technologies.” Similarly according to Amazon such an audit would “necessarily implicate[] a multitude of ordinary business matters relating to the Company’s day-to-day operations” which Amazon argued included decisions relating to among other things its charitable donations hiring decisions diversity and recruitment initiatives customer relations advertising public relations and communications with its shareholders and the kinds of products it sold. Despite the laundry list of examples Amazon cited in its No-Action Letter the SEC did not concur that the proposal was excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

In a webinar hosted by CtW Comptroller DiNapoli explained the importance of racial equity at Amazon and why shareholders should vote in favor of the proposal and argued that “racial inequity is harming the United States economy.” DiNapoli argued that “the pattern and magnitude of issues repeatedly facing the company demonstrate a need for a more in-depth review . . . Concerns related to workforce diversity treatment of minority workers environmental justice in communities of color surveillance and civil rights are just some of the controversies that have troubled Amazon.” For example current and former Amazon employees have accused the company of allowing racism to permeate its operations. The company’s environmental impact has also been called out for allegedly disproportionately affecting minority communities. Comptroller DiNapoli expressed concern with Amazon’s alleged lack of transparency stating that while the company has put policies in place to address this issue it “has not reported to investors the effectiveness or the process for completing its ongoing policy review.” In 2020 Amazon conducted its first human rights assessment which it referenced to support its position that there was no need to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. However Comptroller DiNapoli noted “a human rights assessment is not the same as an independent racial equity audit and shareholders should be weary of equating the two.”

On May 26 2021 Amazon shareholders rejected eleven shareholder proposals at the annual meeting. Among these the proposal for a Racial Equity Audit garnered the most support with 44% of the votes cast on this proposal voting in favor. Comptroller DiNapoli described the vote as “an immense success for a first-time proposal . . . [i]f CEO Jeff Bezos’ shares (70616270 shares 14%) were to be removed from those voting ‘against’ it the proposal received majority support.”

IV: The Focus of Racial Equity Audits on the Financial Industry

Financial institutions and asset management firms have become the focus of Racial Equity Audit shareholder proposals. According to CtW this focus is based on the belief that:

the finance industry has played a critical role in perpetuating unequal wealth distribution to communities of color. Whether it be modern day ‘redlining’ techniques related to mortgage loans to excessive checking account fees to most recently Payday [sic] Protection Program distribution communities of color have faced decades of discrimination as a result of the financial industry’s policies and practices.

While the financial institutions that have received Racial Equity Audit proposals have recently made philanthropic and strategic investments along with other commitments to racial equity CtW has stated that “the only way to effectively address racial injustice and economic inequality is careful study of how the industry’s products and services have contributed to this imbalance” which includes analyzing mortgage issuances the number of bank branches in minority neighborhoods or “banking deserts” and whether charitable contributions are “fully aligned with . . . public statements.”

A. An Outlier in the Financial Industry—BlackRock Agrees to a Racial Equity Audit

BlackRock’s response to the Racial Equity Audit proposal that SEIU submitted for inclusion in its proxy statement was an outlier among the other financial and asset management firms that faced similar proposals. Like the other companies that received shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season SEIU’s proposal urged BlackRock to “assess its behavior through a racial equity lens to identify how it contributes to systemic racism” including where its stated values are misaligned with the impact of its actions. The resolution included in SEIU’s proposal also noted that:

A 2020 report on proxy voting found that BlackRock did not use its clout as a significant owner to advance racial justice. BlackRock opposed nearly all shareholder proposals directly addressing racial justice issues including two proposals at Amazon seeking disclosure regarding hate-promoting products and effects of its facial recognition technology on people of color.

According to SEIU BlackRock “decided that the SEIU proposal is too important to wait until they are voted on at their shareholder meetings” and announced its plans to voluntarily conduct an independent racial audit of its operations. As a result the shareholder proposal was withdrawn and SEIU announced that it was currently working with BlackRock to bring about “needed change within the company and the financial services industry.” Commentators anticipate that BlackRock’s commitment to a Racial Equity Audit “could sway other financial services companies to follow in its footsteps.”

V: Developments for Future Proxy Seasons

A. Racial Audits May Be Here to Stay

ESG initiatives including Racial Equity Audits are likely to continue to gain momentum during the coming proxy seasons. As ESG issues garner more media attention and as younger generations move into the investing space these issues and related disclosures may become increasingly important to consumers investors and other stakeholders. Racial Equity Audits could emerge as a critical tool for companies to evaluate their current social impact and provide an objective method for investors to monitor their investments and potentially identify new companies that could benefit from increased social and economic engagement.

While we witnessed an increase in shareholder proposals related to Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season all such proposals were either withdrawn or defeated. However as Racial Equity Audits become more commonplace and enter the cultural norm these proposals may begin to resonate with more stakeholders and be approved by shareholders as early as the next proxy season.

B. Proactive Companies May Try to Cut These Initiatives Off at the Pass

In light of the anticipated increase in the number of Racial Equity Audit proposals in the coming proxy seasons we may see a corresponding rise in the number of companies that follow BlackRock’s lead and voluntarily conduct their own Racial Equity Audits. Proponents of Racial Equity Audits warn that such audits should be conducted in a robust manner by fully independent third parties and that the subject companies take action to address deficiencies shortcomings and concerns uncovered by the audits. Otherwise these proponents posit a lackluster or hastily conducted Racial Equity Audit or failure to take meaningful action in response to an audit may actually have the opposite effect for the implementing institution—instead of insulating the company from potential proposals demanding Racial Equity Audits faulty or perfunctory audits may instead create a target on the institution’s back for ESG activists in the following years.

C. Proxy Advisory Firms Likely to Weigh In

No major proxy advisory firm has issued official voting guidance on the implementation of Racial Equity Audits—and the two largest advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have been split on their support for shareholder proposals requesting such audits. However in the coming years we believe this is an area in which the proxy advisory firms may issue official voting guidance. On July 28 2021 ISS launched its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey which included requests for feedback on Racial Equity Audits. ISS will use the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey as a “key component of ISS’ annual policy development process to assess potential policy changes across regions and markets for 2022 and beyond.” While ISS has largely appeared hesitant to support Racial Equity Audits in the circumstances presented in the 2021 proxy season the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey could change its future guidance and recommendations on such audits. As the area develops (and if more companies voluntarily implement these audits) Racial Equity Audits could become viewed as good corporate governance particularly if top proxy advisory firms issue official guidance supporting the implementation of such audits.

The proxy advisory firms’ level of guidance may take varying forms—at the low end proxy advisory firms may increase a company’s ESG or corporate governance “score” for having in the past or recently conducted a Racial Equity Audit. At the higher end proxy advisory firms may offer official guidelines on what they believe are minimum actions a company should take with respect to Racial Equity Audits in order to receive the advisor’s support. For example such guidelines may provide for a minimum frequency of Racial Equity Audits and indicate parameters on what attributes an audit must possess to be considered sufficient. In this case failure to have a Racial Equity Audit policy or refusal to implement such a policy after shareholders have approved a proposal to implement one may become a criteria an advisory firm would consider in making a recommendation for or against the re-election of a company’s chairperson of the governance committee and/or the re-election of other directors at the company’s annual meeting.

Clear guidance from proxy advisory firms would also be beneficial to companies considering implementing Racial Equity Audit policies by offering indications on what parameters constitute “best practices” and how frequently these audits should occur. By offering such guidance companies may find it easier to voluntarily implement Racial Equity Audit policies.

D. Potential Legislative or Regulatory Mandates

Even with an increase in the number of shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits it is possible that companies may not adopt them as quickly or as widely as the public and/or certain legislative bodies would prefer. If this occurs legislators and/or regulatory authorities may at some point in the future step in to close the gap between investor demand and practical implementation. We saw this occur in California with Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 discussed in further detail above. As the general public’s views evolve on ESG issues public pressure for certain actions—in this case increased diversity in public boardrooms—often influence not just shareholder advocacy but legislative action. The California legislature recognized the public desire to move towards greater diversity on public boards and codified set requirements. In this way legislatures and/or regulatory authorities have the ability to serve as the catalyst for change and wider-reaching adoption by forcing companies that might have been unlikely or slow to act on their own to adopt such policies.

Indeed the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion is currently reviewing legislation that would require banks to conduct Racial Equity Audits every two years in an effort to promote diversity and equity. The proposed Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act would require such audits by independent third parties of the subject companies’ “policies and practices pertaining to civil rights equity diversity and inclusion.” The initial debates on the draft legislation also considered adding to the draft bill penalties for non-compliance including fines of up to $20000 a day for failure to engage in such audits. The draft legislation would also require banks to investigate what ties they may have to slavery and disclose steps such institution would take to reconcile profits it may have received from slavery. The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Joyce Beatty and co-sponsored by Reps. Nikema Williams and Jesus G. Garcia and is currently under committee review.

Other external forces that may prompt public companies to adopt Racial Equity Audit policies are the SEC and the securities exchanges. Currently neither the SEC nor the major U.S. securities exchanges mandate publicly traded companies to make disclosures regarding Racial Equity Audit initiatives. However on August 6 2021 the SEC approved new listing rules proposed by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) requiring each Nasdaq-listed company to disclose certain information about the diversity of its board of directors and generally include a minimum number of members of its board of directors who are Diverse (as defined within the new listing rules). Accordingly as Racial Equity Audits become an increasingly important area for investors it is possible that the SEC and the major exchanges may eventually require companies to make further diversity equity and inclusion disclosures which may include the existence and frequency of a company’s Racial Equity Audits.

Legislative or regulatory requirements are not without their own risks and compliance with any such minimum standards would not be fool proof to insulate a company from potential ESG proposals and proxy campaigns. Racial Equity Audits and similar equity and inclusion initiatives that are not robust or designed with the aid of independent third party consultants may risk being perceived as mere “window dressing” and invite criticism from shareholders.

E. Companies Should Stay Informed in This Area

Given current trends in ESG public companies should stay informed on Racial Equity Audits and their adoption crafting and implementation. Further companies wishing to stay ahead of the curve may start by critically and objectively looking at their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion and identifying areas in need of improvement. If a company lags behind in this quickly developing area we believe shareholders may become more willing to launch shareholder campaigns focused on ESG issues including demanding objective results through Racial Equity Audits.

The $1.8-million road will be gravel and used only in times of emergency.

Residents in Juniper Ridge and Rose Hill aren’t the only ones getting a new emergency exit in the wake of this year's wildfire season with plans now in the works for an additional road connecting Pineview and Aberdeen.

The projects have been bundled together by city staff with a combined estimated price tag of nearly $20 million.

Emergency egress became a hot topic in Kamloops in the wake of the Kamloops East fire on Canada Day which burned perilously close to homes in Valleyview and Juniper Ridge. Traffic became backed up in Juniper and it took hours for some residents to get down the hill to safety in Valleyview.

No one was injured in the fire and no homes were destroyed but tactical evacuations were conducted and the close call prompted promised action from the city. Five days after the fire City of Kamloops CAO David Trawin committed to fast-tracking plans for a new paved road in and out of Juniper.

In a document going before city council on Tuesday city staff describe the “bundled emergency egress project” as a means to “improve public safety during natural hazard events such as wildfires.”

The document outlines four aspects to the project — a new permanent road linking Juniper and Rose Hill improvements to Rose Hill Road improvements to the Rose Hill Road-Valleyview Drive intersection and a new emergency “secondary access route” linking Pineview with Aberdeen.

The biggest chunk of the $19.6-million estimated cost will be the improvements to Rose Hill Road which is described by city staff in the document as being “well short of today’s road design guidelines.” Improvements to the road are expected to cost $15.3 million.

The paved road connecting Juniper with Rose Hill will cost the city an estimated $2.5 million while the gravel emergency road linking Pineview with Aberdeen will come with a $1.8-million price tag.

In addition to providing emergency egress from Juniper Rose Hill Aberdeen and Pineview the roads could also act as fire breaks in the event of an interface fire.

Pineview was placed on evacuation alert on Aug. 15 due to the Tremont Creek wildfire which was 13 kilometres west of city limits at the time. The alert was rescinded two days later.

City council will be asked on Tuesday to apply for grant funding to cover some of the costs associated with the project.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though the historic Milleridge Inn in Jericho is not designated as an official landmark its origins on Long Island can be traced back to before the time of the Revolutionary War when the 11-acre property was used as a stopover for farmers merchants and other weary travelers along what is now Jericho Turnpike.

“The original property dates back to 1672…the history of the place says Milleridge has had presidents eating there settlers British and Hessian soldiers and even an underground bootlegging operation during the prohibition era” says Butch Yamali president of the Freeport-based Dover Group.

Yamali purchased the Milleridge in 2016 from Kimco Realty effectively saving the centuries-old property from becoming either a hotel retirement community or another commercial entity.

“We’ve got everything back online we updated the menu…we wanted to maintain the Milleridge history” says Yamali.

The sprawling Milleridge complex is an impressive property able to accommodate about 1000 diners. It also features a catering hall cafe pub bakery flower shop and general store.

No stranger to the hospitality business Yamali founded his Dover Group in 1976 from just a couple of ice cream trucks. Today the company owns and operates several local businesses and restaurants including Peter’s Clam Bar in Island Park and the Coral House in Baldwin.

“I’ve made it a practice to take over once-great places that have lost their luster where owners have either aged out or lost interest in upkeep” says Yamali.

Yamali says he is a self-taught chef who didn’t go to culinary school but has worked in many of his father’s restaurant kitchens since the age of 14. “I did lots of roasting and curing meats in the places I worked at” he says noting that his father owned the gourmet meats shop Pastrami King in Queens when Butch was growing up.

“I’m now 59 I’ve been doing this stuff for the past 45 years working in nearly every position you can imagine.”

Ironically Yamali says he doesn’t really like cooking and that is where executive chef Chris Seidl comes in.

Seidl who grew up in Syosset also didn’t go to culinary school. He began cooking at a small cafe in Utica while attending Mohawk Valley Community College. “I took a liking to the kitchen and that was it” he recalls.

Seidl has been with Yamali for the past 13 years starting off at the Maliblue Oyster Bar in Lido Beach. He now oversees most aspects of cooking menu planning and other logistics for all of Dover’s properties.



Seidl says the Milleridge is something special. “What is unique about the Milleridge is that everything we make is from scratch from the fresh-baked popovers and cinnamon bread to turkeys we roast and sauerbraten that is brined for at least two weeks…it’s a traditional homestyle cooking restaurant” says Seidl.

Milleridge specialties include chicken Milleridge Yankee pot roast sauerbraten fresh-roasted turkey with all the trimmings chicken pot pie salads and burgers. “We sell thousands of meals every week” says Yamali explaining that anywhere from 1200 to 1500 people per day can be fed when the restaurant is very busy.

In 2015 Restaurant Business Magazine ranked the Milleridge as one of America’s top 100 restaurants with about $14 million in annual sales.

Yamali says by the end of 2017 sales had nearly doubled and continued to rise into 2018.

But then Covid-19 came along and put a severe crimp in business.

“We want to get things back to where we were” Yamaha says adding that a confluence of staff shortages and high-priced goods has continued to hamper business.

But things are looking up.

Yamali says that now all the complex’s structures are now up to code with just a few more things that still need work.

However he says labor shortages have continued to plague the venue along with many other restaurants on Long Island.

Yamali has cut back hours to try and help matters. The restaurant is now open only five days per week from Wednesday to Sunday to help address persistent labor shortages and still allow staff to take much-needed days off.

He says that as staffing issues ease he’ll add staff and extend the hours.

“Some of my staff never returned after the closures in 2020 some got real estate licenses still other staffers are leaving the restaurant business altogether and still others have moved out of state completely for lower costs of living” Yamali says.

In addition he points to food prices that have doubled in many cases. “Filet mignon used to be about $10 pound now it’s nearly $20. But I can’t raise my prices because that might mean losing business.”

He adds that while most things are picking up larger parties are still lagging. “People don’t want grandma to come out of the house yet” he says adding that catered events are still slow such as weddings and bridal showers.

“When it’s busy there’s nothing like it. But when it’s quiet you want to cry because it’s such a big place.”



He says however that Thanksgiving orders and reservations are brisk and that’s a “good sign.”

Diners can also look forward to a traditional favorite the Milleridge Christmas Village which will feature an elaborate array of music decorations and holiday festivities.

Based on extensive research and nearly 100 interviews the report examines California’s economic footprint in Israel Israel’s economic presence in California key technologies where that activity is focused and future opportunities for collaboration.

Built on shared values and aligned interests the relationship between California’s Silicon Valley and Israel’s Silicon Wadi is reflected in growing venture investment large-scale acquisitions of Israeli companies successful Israeli-founded unicorns and public companies in Silicon Valley and extensive corporate and binational R&D.

“Drawn by the search for engineering talent Silicon Valley companies began their migration to Israel in the mid-1970s a movement that has continued to the point where today California R&D centers are pervasive” the report states. “Silicon Valley’s footprint can be seen most deeply in its concentrated investment in software and IT services.

More highlights of the report:

• From January 2003 to February 2021 California companies made 147 foreign direct investment projects in Israel. Software and IT services was the leading field followed by semiconductors financial services and communications.

• 103 California companies invested a total of $22.4 billion in Israeli companies between 2003 and 2021.

• California-based companies are responsible for 20 percent of all acquisitions of Israeli companies globally and for 42% of all acquisitions by US-based companies.

• Out of 402 multinational companies with an innovation presence in Israel 96 are California headquartered and 80 of those are from the Bay Area.

• California hosts 140 Israeli-owned firms that support 6248 jobs amounting to $615 million in wages.

• California is home to 22 Israeli-founded technology unicorns the most of any US state.

• Three of the five largest Israeli acquisitions in history and seven of the top 15 acquisitions were made by California companies including Mobileye and Moovit by Intel Mellanox by NVIDIA and Waze by Google.

Silicon Valley-headquartered firms such as Applied Materials KLA Corporation IBM Oracle Cisco Salesforce and Intel exemplify the role that Israel plays in the global R&D and business strategy of multinational companies.

“Intel with 14000 employees is both Israel’s largest technology company and its largest private employer” the report states.

Looking toward the future the report pinpoints promising fields for future cooperation as biotech data science and security particularly advanced cryptographic systems such as postquantum cryptography.

“Embedding intelligence at the edges of computing — through intelligent vehicles and highway systems for example — is creating new security vulnerabilities. With more intelligence in the grid there is a growing question of how to secure it and with the world at an inflection point between data-enabled connectivity and systemic vulnerability a rich opportunity exists for collaboration with Israel in fields such as AI and cybersecurity” the report predicts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNDQ4NTMyL2tsYXJuYS1tYXJrZXQtdG8tc2VlLXN0cm9uZy1ncm93dGgtbW9tZW50dW0ta2xhcm5hLWFmdGVycGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Klarna Market to See Strong Growth Momentum | Klarna Afterpay,"Klarna Market to See Strong Growth Momentum | Klarna Afterpay

A global pandemic led to interrupted Zoom calls. But who could have known? Many preferred clocking in feet from the breakfast table. With mask/vax mandates and a big save on commuting expenses social media has dubbed the mass exodus to better jobs the “Great Resignation.”

No doubt there’s anxiety. Working at home is safer amid a global pandemic and scary new variants. It’s also isolating and lonely. Workers may perform better without water cooler distractions but may also doubt themselves and feel job uncertainty because of a lack of contact with decision-makers.

Source: Mary Pahlke/Pixabay

Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton likely began their book Anxiety At Work before lockdown. They stated that 34 percent of workers reported anxiety at least once in any month in 2018. Eighteen percent reported a diagnosed anxiety disorder.

According to a 2019 study published in the Harvard Business Review more than half of millennials and 75 percent of Gen Z reportedly quit a job for mental health reasons.2

It’s old-school to believe that these employees need to calm down. As well the notion that anxious employees perform in subpar fashion or are less valuable is nonsense. Quite the opposite: They work harder. Mensa members reportedly suffer from anxiety disorders at twice the national average.

So what’s a manager or employee to do? The best leaders create the benefits of a healthy work environment free of passive-aggressive drama (gossip sniping setups and sabotage). Our own book Overcoming Passive-Aggression includes a quiz to determine one’s performance style. Yes whether you are direct and adaptable shy away from confrontation or are indirect matters greatly.3

The healthcare field is rife with exhaustion and it turns out passive-aggressive behavior. Sixty percent of new nurses leave their job within six months of hire due to bullying; 20 percent leave the field within three years.4 These are pre-pandemic statistics leaving us to assume even worse numbers now.

If the global pandemic of 2020 had “one heartening result” Shirley Weinstein at Kraft Heinz told Gostick and Elton “it was the realization to managers at all levels that anxiety is a real business issue.”

Here’s a template for tackling anxiety in the workforce:

Pay Attention and Listen. At Kraft Heinz they call this “empathy and care.” Managers learn to understand that workers struggle with work/life balance burnout anxiety decreased energy and depression. They recognize the inability to concentrate hypersensitivity restlessness over-checking reassurance-seeking and frequent somatic complaints as signs of anxiety.

Though many companies offer employee assistance programs some employees are still reluctant to ask for help. As Murphy and Oberlin point out in Overcoming Passive Aggression “ego and entitlement wall off good ideas” that employees often have; thus managers should honor their employees’ experience and involve them as well.

Source: Loriann Oberlin MS

Meet uncertainty head-on. Learn six steps to combat this in Anxiety at Work. It’s okay not to have all answers. Ensure everyone knows work expectations. Keep the focus on what can be controlled.

Provide more training for email etiquette anti-bullying and social behavior. Procrastinators are stressed. Perfectionists have way too much anxiety that can become obsessive as they hold themselves and those around them to unattainable standards. Poor email often shows a lack of communication skills.

Encourage time off and help make it happen. The 2021 “Great Resignation” where employees have asserted what they want and left positions to obtain just that has complicated this but time away is vital to a healthy workplace.

Managers should set an example taking time to relax and encourage their workers to use vacation say Gostick and Elton. “More than 70 percent of employees report increased productivity when they take short breaks during the day to exercise socialize or just grab a breath of fresh air” they said.

Not all anxiety is equal. Nor is it all mental health-related or the result of a tense environment. Sometimes it’s because life is difficult and relatively unjust given individual journeys no more true than for minority groups and LGBTQ. Wise leaders recognize stigma-related prejudice chronic stress of being discriminated against or hyper-vigilance fearing it. Good managers correct situations before they spiral into more significant concerns.

Know that anxiety can be hidden and debilitating. Imposter syndrome occurs when even successful employees or performers feel that the world is just waiting to uncover weaknesses. It’s happened to Steve Martin and Lady Gaga. Worrying about one’s limitations without support or proper coping mechanisms and without accurate diagnosis and treatment forces the anxious person’s brain into an even more negative place.5 So too the adverse health consequences mount such that there’s an entire chapter outlining them in Overcoming Passive-Aggression.

Rein in attitude and express gratitude. No one needs the former due to its stress-inducing consequences. Gratitude on the other hand helps to reduce cortisol (stress hormone) levels. We also know that when we pay attention to good or exemplary behavior we’ll see more of it. Yes recognize what’s right and you will often see people work to achieve that and be far less anxious.

These are often difficult decisions about how to wisely spend taxpayer dollars and where that money would make the most difference.

Directing investment to neglected parts of Dallas south of Interstate 30 must be a priority but the council also has to weigh opportunities to encourage the construction of affordable housing stock in the city’s more affluent northern half.

Advertisement

We agree with Council Member Paul Ridley of District 14: If any council district needs to incentivize workforce housing it is his district spanning Uptown Old East Dallas and part of downtown — an area that is one of the most prosperous in Dallas and one of its hottest real estate markets.

Advertisement

That is why we are glad that the City Council ultimately approved a $2 million tax break for Kroger and its development partner to build a mixed-use property near downtown that will include 75 affordable apartments in a 375-unit complex. These 75 apartments will be reserved for residents making 60% or less of the area median income. For a single person that’s about $37300 and for a family of four $53400.

The tax break was nearly derailed by a controversy over the money going to large grocer Kroger and the supermarket that will anchor the project. This prompted complaints from residents and council members that the city was giving away money to a business and a neighborhood that don’t need the assistance.

Advertisement

But that was a distraction. This proposal is about funding affordable rentals. The real dilemma here had to do with a restrictive covenant on the property which requires that if housing is built on the land that a fifth of units be affordable at 60% of the area median income or less. Council Member Cara Mendelsohn argued that Kroger is asking for a handout to do what it is required to do anyway.

However as other council members pointed out the land is zoned for multiple uses so an apartment complex should not be viewed as fait accompli. And as Ridley underscored developers usually need public incentives to build affordable housing because that housing stock is not profitable for them. A restrictive covenant won’t pay for the units to be built.

Council members who objected to the incentive raised legitimate issues but we think the council majority made the best decision with the facts on hand. The $2 million tax abatement over 10 years will deliver 75 apartments dedicated in perpetuity to low-income workers and their families. That comes out to about $28000 per unit.

Advertisement

That is not a cash subsidy but tax revenue that the city is foregoing in the next decade to guarantee affordable housing. We think that’s a good deal.

Advertisement

It’s also worth noting that Ridley cut the tax break in half from the $4 million that city staff had recommended making it a better deal for the city.

Ultimately the council’s decision rested on reasonable speculation that affordable apartments might not be built in an increasingly expensive neighborhood without a city incentive. Dallas leaders committed in recent years to increase workforce housing and to focus on getting those homes built in neighborhoods near jobs stores and good schools. A deal like this one is the cost of delivering on that commitment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbnR1Y2t5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0YXRlL2tlbnR1Y2t5L2FydGljbGUyNTU0MjgyMDYuaHRtbNIBQmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtlbnR1Y2t5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0YXRlL2tlbnR1Y2t5L2FydGljbGUyNTU0MjgyMDYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Lexington high school just won its 22nd state marching band championship,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kentucky.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Cheyna Matthews could not stop laughing when recalling the funniest story with any of her teammates spending time interacting with her children Josiah and Lionel. Her most recent memory involves a shopping trip to the grocery store Kroger two women named Katie and a pacifier.

“The amount of work it takes to get two kids in the car and go to Kroger… for someone who doesn’t have kids it’s the easiest thing in the world but as someone who has to get two babies out of the car it’s not that simple!” Matthews said.

So she turned to her teammates for help. Matthews explained that Racing Louisville FC’s housing setup has all the players in one area for apartments — if not one building then teammates are in an apartment complex right next door. Matthews put a message in the team’s group chat asking for any volunteers to help look after her two kids while she went on a quick run to the grocery store.

“I thought you know this is my first time asking my teammates to help with the kids” Matthews said. “It’s one thing to say ‘Let me know if you need any help’ but it’s another thing to actually ask. Within 10 seconds Katie McClure responded and said she’ll do it. But if you know anything about Katie McClure it’s that she’s always with Katie Lund.

Around the state

In a battle of state powers Boyle County (9-1) made a statement with a 34-7 victory at Frederick Douglass (9-1) on Friday.

Rebels quarterback Jagger Gillis threw two touchdowns passes and ran for two scores in the victory.

“We’re not surprised” Gillis told the Lexington Herald Leader. “We know what we’re all about.”

Broncos wide receiver Dane Key who committed to the University of Kentucky earlier this week had five receptions for 54 yards in the loss.

As scientific research continues to connect pesticide exposures to harmful human health effects a new report ranked the efforts of 17 major U.S. food manufacturers to reduce pesticides in agriculture. The report was conducted by As You Sow and found General Mills Lamb Weston Del Monte and PepsiCo to score the highest when it came their actions to reduce the growing risk of pesticide use.

The report Pesticides in the Pantry: Transparency & Risk in Food Supply Chains ranked 17 major U.S. food manufacturers “based on their performance on 28 indicators designed to measure how effectively companies are reducing pesticide risk and improving agricultural resiliency.” Out of 27 possible points General Mills (16 points) Lamb Weston (15) Del Monte (14) and PepsiCo (14) scored the highest while Post and B&G Foods scored the lowest (0 points each) followed by J.M. Smucker (1 point).

“Investors expect companies to be planning for the future and preparing for the effects of climate change” Danielle Fugere As You Sow’s president and a contributor to the report said. “For food companies climate resilience requires investing in agricultural systems that restore ecosystems and soil health and dramatically reduce the use of toxic chemicals.”

While there are “new initiatives that aim to transition land to regenerative farming practices that are better for the environment farmers and consumers” this report confirms that “these efforts could be thwarted by continued use of pesticides as companies for the most part continue to ignore this important component of risk and resiliency.”

The harmful health effects of pesticide exposure includes cancer cardiovascular disease birth and developmental defects liver and kidney disease and obesity according to scientific research. And pesticide-based agriculture is harmful to the environment as studies demonstrate it causes loss of critical pollinator species reduced biodiversity and toxins in waterways.

Several companies made new commitments to reduce pesticide risk according to the report which is an improvement compared to 2019. But “problematically companies continue to avoid addressing and accounting for pesticide use as a meaningful component of promoting agricultural resiliency” according to the report. Therefore As You Sow offers “alternative solutions to support farmers in transitioning away from chemical-dependent farming systems” such as certified organic farming integrated pest management and regenerative agriculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hoy conocemos como libros bestseller (traducido a “mejor vendidos” en español) a los que batieron récords de ventas durante el 2021

Tiempo de lectura: 3 minutos

La invención de la imprenta de la mano del alemán Johannes Gutenberg significó un cambio a nivel histórico cultural e intelectual y una evolución de la Edad Media a la Edad Moderna y el Renacimiento. Desde su creación a la actualidad se han publicado 150 millones de libros impresos de diferentes géneros en todo el mundo.

Las razones del éxito son un enigma sin dudas. Pero está muy claro que es el público quien tiene el poder real de decidir de forma indirecta qué obras entran en este ranking de popularidad y cuáles no.

Hoy conocemos como libros bestseller (traducido a “mejor vendidos” en español) a los que batieron récords de ventas. Estos son algunos de ellos:

1 – La Biblia

Un libro que ha trascendido las épocas y las tecnologías con ediciones continuas es La Biblia. Se estima que este histórico y canónico libro del cristianismo y el judaísmo que transmite la palabra de Dios ostenta el récord Guinness del libro más vendido y distribuido de la historia con más de 5 mil millones de copias.

2 – El Quijote de La Mancha

Escrita por el español Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra con cerca de 500 millones de copias. La mayoría de historiadores coinciden en que es el libro no religioso más vendido y leído del mundo. Las cifras que no paran de subir con el paso del tiempo se traducen con la publicación de más de 690 ediciones en diferentes idiomas.

3 – Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal

Es el primer libro de la serie Harry Potter de la escritora inglesa J. K. Rowling ha vendido más de 120 millones de copias. La serie de siete libros fue traducida a 80 idiomas por ende no es solo uno de los libros mas vendidos sino también uno de los mas traducidos del mundo.

4 – El Principito

Es considerada como la obra mas importante y conocida del escritor francés Antoine de Saint-Exupéry cuenta con 140 millones de libros vendidos. Esta novela corta y poética ilustrada con imágenes hechas con acuarelas por el propio escritor enternece los corazones de los lectores de cualquier edad. A pesar de que es considerado un libro infantil por la forma en la que se encuentra escrito también tiene una trama filosófica con observaciones profundas sobre la vida y la naturaleza humana.

5 – El Secreto

Este bestseller publicado por Rhonda Byrne fue traducido a más de 50 idiomas y se ha convertido en el libro más vendido de estos últimos años. Pasa de generación en generación debido al alto nivel de autoayuda que sus páginas ofrecen tratando temas como la ley de atracción.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZWx2YWluZm9ybWFjaW9uLmVzL2h1ZWx2YS9XYXItUm9vbS1EaXNjdXJzb3MtcGFyZWNlbi1pbXByb3Zpc2Fkb3MtdmlkZW9fMF8xNjI0MzM5NzAxLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5odWVsdmFpbmZvcm1hY2lvbi5lcy9odWVsdmEvV2FyLVJvb20tRGlzY3Vyc29zLXBhcmVjZW4taW1wcm92aXNhZG9zLXZpZGVvXzBfMTYyNDMzOTcwMS5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discursos leídos que parecen improvisados,"John F. Kennedy está considerado como la primera estrella de la televisión. Tan natural era en sus intervenciones que pareciera que improvisaba. De haber pronunciado un discurso hoy en tiempos del teleprompter nadie pensaría que el presidente estuviera leyendo el texto. Para adquirir esa naturalidad sólo hay un secreto: el ensayo.

Grandes oradores han pronunciado sus discursos leyendo. Lo que marca la diferencia es que hacen de ello un arte. Otros presidentes de EEUU como Ronald Reagan Bill Clinton y Barack Obama o curtidos disertadores como Adolf Hitler Joseph Goebbels y Fidel Castro han mostrado una extraordinaria capacidad en la tribuna. Y lo hacían con tanta naturalidad porque ensayaban previamente hasta lograr transmitir y conectar con el público como los actores en un escenario.

Leer como si se estuviera hablando. Esa es la clave de bóveda para que un discurso alcance la excelencia. Y tal maestría se adquiere con el ensayo y la práctica. El entrenamiento puede realizar en soledad o con audiencia; grabado con una cámara o frente al espejo. Lo importante es ensayar y cuanto más mejor hasta para los oradores más experimentados. Generalmente tras extraordinarias intervenciones suele haber detrás intensas horas de trabajo mientras que por regla general quienes se consideran sobradamente preparados son aquellos que más suelen necesitar del aprendizaje y la dedicación previa antes de ponerse delante de un micrófono.

La lectura de un discurso se asemeja a una puesta en escena por parte de un actor y como si de una obra de teatro se tratara debe transmitir emociones y evocar sensaciones a través de los gestos los movimientos corporales las inflexiones de voz o las pausas. Existen diferentes métodos para trabajar esa escenificación. Uno de los mejores oradores de todos los tiempos Winston Churchill formuló la teoría de las 3P de la oratoria según recoge el libro Consultoría Política: pose pronunciación y pausa.

Para el político británico variar la pose significaba mejorar la exposición con el lenguaje no verbal logrando que el cuerpo sea una extensión de la voz y enriqueciendo el repertorio de gestos. Se trata en definitiva de saber moverse en el atril utilizando magistralmente las manos los pasos y los giros de la mirada transmitiendo ánimo y energía.

El propósito de variar la pronunciación es poner emoción en la exposición. Para ello el orador se ayuda de la entonación el énfasis en determinadas palabras la vocalización y las inflexiones de voz. Para matar el aburrimiento de la audiencia conviene variar el ritmo y el volumen alzando la voz y acelerando y desacelerando para imprimir ritmo y musicalidad a las palabras.

No olvidar la pausa es esencial en los discursos algo difícil por el miedo que los oradores sienten al silencio. Los segundos en vacío les parecen una eternidad y sin embargo son necesarios para que la audiencia pueda asimilar el mensaje. Es además una fórmula extraordinariamente útil de generar expectación atraer la atención enfatizar las palabras y buscar el aplauso.

Esta forma de puesta en escena del discurso puede suponer una garantía de éxito siempre que se cumplan dos premisas: un mensaje persuasivo y un trabajo previo. El ensayo no tiene por objetivo aprenderse un texto de memoria algo que ocurrirá de manera natural. La interiorización del discurso propiciado por la práctica es lo que permite el manejo del lenguaje no verbal las inflexiones de la voz y el dominio de las pausas. Además se estará mucho más preparado para afrontar cualquier tipo de imprevisto.

Persuadir y convencer

De igual manera nada de esto tendrá sentido si lo que el orador está contándole a su público no está a la altura. En cuanto a los aspectos formales y en tanto que es un texto para ser pronunciado en voz alta debe ser sencillo de leer con palabras fáciles de pronunciar y con frases claras y decodificables sin ningún tipo de esfuerzo intelectual.

Porque el objetivo de todo buen discurso no es quedar bien ante la audiencia ni pronunciar unas bellas palabras que entretengan al público. Un discurso ha de ser comprensible creíble y memorable para posteriormente persuadir y convencer. Y ello se consigue penetrando en el corazón pero también el cerebro de las personas.

Para el experto en discursos y liderazgo Yago de Marta convencer es “contarle una historia a una persona mejor de la que le estaban contando. No consiste en bonitas frases sino en que cada frase sea una imagen”.

Actualmente muchos de los discursos políticos contienen un alto voltaje emocional en contra de la opinión de muchos expertos que alertan del peligro de centrarse en la importancia de las emociones. “Emocionar por emocionar sólo lleva a que te pegues contra un muro” opina Yago de Marta. A su juicio el objetivo debe ser “que te entiendan te crean y te recuerden. Si eso es así el mensaje entra en el cerebro y se va a quedar allí”.

En otras palaras el fin de un discurso no es que el público se emocione sino que sea capaz de ver y sentir lo mismo que el orador. La obra Consultoría Política abunda sobre este aspecto: “el orador debe centrarse en la definición de las imágenes y en su profundidad y no en intentar emocionar. Si ven lo que quiere que vean se emocionarán pero ése es un objetivo secundario”.

Para lograr un discurso memorable que sea creíble y que convenza De Marta ofrece siete consejos para hablar en público: 1. Visualiza a tu público; 2. Cuida las palabras que utilices; 3. Distribuye muy bien tus tiempos; 4. Domina los silencios; 5. Conoce bien tu discurso; 6. Cuida tu postura; 7. Muestra seguridad.

Junto a todo ello no debemos perder de vista que la atención es un bien escaso y que a partir de los 15 minutos de exposición es probable que ya el púbico no esté atendiendo al orador. Así que como ya escribiera Baltasar Gracián en su obra literaria Oráculo manual y arte de prudencia (1647) “lo bueno si breve dos veces bueno; y aun lo malo si poco no tan malo”.

Las especies fluctúan entre los 50 y 130 centímetros de altura las que crecían bajo un sistema indoor dispuesto por el ahora imputado.

Fue tras recepcionar una denuncia anónima que la policía civil en coordinación con el Ministerio Público efectuaron diversas diligencias que permitieron georreferenciar el cultivo y cosecha de la droga vegetal al interior de dicha comuna de la región de Valparaíso.

El procedimiento se registró al interior de un fundo donde se encontraban las matas en proceso de crecimiento.

La PDI realizó la entrada y registro voluntario del inmueble donde incautaron las plantas cuyas medidas fluctúan entre los 50 y 130 centímetros de altura; cuatro en proceso de secado y 73 gramos procesada además de elementos propios para la dosificación y siete focos led utilizados para una plantación con sistema indoor.

Quien entregó detalles de este procedimiento fue el subprefecto Marco León jefe Bicrim San Felipe.

El autor de títulos como Campos de fresas o El asesinato del profesor de matemáticas presentará su última novela La conjura d’Herat (Univers) mañana a las 17.00 en el patio de La Misericòrdia dentro la Setmana del Llibre en Català de Palma.

Campos de fresas Las chicas de alambre... Son clásicos que se siguen leyendo hoy en día.

—Sí más que bestsellers hago longsellers. ¡Hoy en día que un libro dure más de dos años ya es un auténtico milagro! Me siento querido cuando los maestros me ven en algún sitio se emocionan y me dan las gracias por escribir. En 2022 hará 50 años que publico.

Muchas de esas novelas son lecturas obligatorias de instituto. ¿Qué le parece?

—Fatal. Cuando era niño odiaba a Cervantes. Ahora sé que muchos niños deben de odiarme a mí. Pero la verdad es que los profesores me dicen que no recuerdan que ningún niño les haya tirado un libro mío por la cabeza o se hayan quejado. Nunca he escrito un libro pensando en que lo leerán en la escuela porque en ese caso sería un libro dirigido. No escribo para jóvenes escribo de jóvenes.

En 2004 creó la Fundació Jordi Sierra i Fabra para empujar a los jóvenes hacia la lectura y escritura ¿un empuje que usted no tuvo?

—De niño lo pasé fatal. No era un buen estudiante era tartamudo y mi padre me prohibió escribir que era mi sueño. En la escuela me decían que era un inútil. Una vez me hice mayor vi que había muchos niños que querían escribir y no les dejaban o no confiaban en ellos mismos por eso creé un premio literario para menores de 18 años. Era mi manera de decirles ‘creo en vosotros escribid’. También tenemos la Fundación Taller de Letras Jordi Sierra i Fabra para Latinoamérica y la revista online gratuita La Página Escrita. Intento ayudar a los demás. Gandhi decía que la peor violencia es la indiferencia. Si hay gente en este mundo tan materialista egoísta y corrupto que puede hacer algo y no lo hace somos cómplices de que esté peor.

¿Cree que han cambiado las historias o los lectores?

—Cuando publiqué Campos de fresas no había móviles ni internet pero todavía se lee. Los sentimientos no cambian puede que sí lo haga el entorno cotidiano pero las personas nos enamoramos igual. Eso sí en los últimos cinco años por culpa de los móviles los jóvenes comprenden menos. Dar un móvil a un niño de 12 años es como darle un arma de destrucción masiva; es un agujero negro que le chupa toda la energía. Se lee más que nunca es verdad pero eso no quiere decir que se aproveche más que nunca. Además se ha perdido por completo la cultura del esfuerzo.

La educación sí ha mejorado hoy en día a un profesor no se le ocurriría llamar inútil a un niño.

—El problema que tienen hoy los profesores son las AMPAs. Un profesor tiene que conseguir que los alumnos piensen y si para ello tienen que leer un libro en concreto los padres lo tienen que respetar. No puede ser que a una madre que no le guste ese libro porque trata de gays lesbianas sexo o lo que sea vaya a quejarse al profesor. Así los institutos escogen libros chorras para no meterse en líos. Hoy en día los jóvenes ven películas y series que no deberían porno en internet pero luego los padres se quejan cuando en un libro se habla de sexo. En el libro a diferencia de lo que vea en internet se explicará y razonará; no será algo frío y explícito. Pero es el libro el que se censura y se vigila que es lo más bestia que se puede imaginar socialmente.

Lleva más de 500 libros publicados una cifre que sigue creciendo.

—No sé hacer otra cosa es lo que más me gusta del mundo y no puedo parar de escribir. Tengo pendientes de publicar unos cuarenta libros y sé que muchos de ellos no verán nunca la luz porque o no gustan o no interesan a las editoriales. Y no pasada nada. Por otra parte vivimos en un país raro en el que un tío que ha publicado 500 libros y que ha vendido catorce millones de ejemplares es que hace churros. La gente que me critica es la que no me ha leído. Hay once libros pendientes de salir el año que viene y para 2023 ya hay cinco que están hechos.

Viene a Palma a presentar La conjura d’Herat segunda entrega de la serie protagonizada por la periodista Magda Ventura.

—Tenía la serie de Miquel Mascarell un expolicía republicano ambientada en los años 40 y 50. Los lectores me decían que echaban en falta una novela policíaca mía ambientada en la actualidad. Así que pensé en crear un personaje totalmente opuesto a Mascarell una mujer de hoy en día y periodista de investigación. Hablé con la editorial y propuse hacer una trilogía. La tercera parte La connexió maltesa saldrá en 2022. De Mascarell se publicará en abril Uns quants dies de febrer.

¿Cuál es su libro preferido?

—El manantial de Ayn Rand que me cambió la vida cuando tenía 17 años. Me hizo descubrir quién soy y que quería ser como el protagonista :nunca nadie ha tocado mis libros antes muerto que alterar lo que hago soy artista. La película protagonizada por Gary Cooper por cierto capta muy bien la esencia del libro.

Fue uno de los grandes expertos en música en los 60 y 70 y escribió importantes biografías. ¿Le gustaría retomar aquellos proyectos?

—Dejé la música hace años para escribir novelas. Lo último que escribí fue cuando Bob Dylan ganó el Nobel de Literatura un libro cortito para que los jóvenes le conocieran. Me gustaría haber escrito por ejemplo la biografía de Freddy Mercury a quien tuve el privilegio de conocer. Igualmente muchas de mis novelas tienen un importante ambiente musical. Cuando murió Avici por ejemplo escribí DJ una novela a la que tengo un gran cariño."

These stubs hold a special place in the attendee’s heart. That ticket opens up a memory that each person can relive from when they were there. However as the world shifts to a fully online community these small mementos are beginning to be forgotten art. Now as it seems that every venue is transitioning to digital tickets the importance of a physical ticket has almost vanished. But Live Nation is trying to fix that. With the new Swedish House Mafia tour taking place next year Live Nation has revealed its new digital collectible ticket stubs in the form of an NFT.

Fans will now have the opportunity to collect digital ticket stubs called Live Stubs that resemble the unique section row and seat of the ticket purchased. The Live Stubs NFT will now allow artists to do much more with the people who collect the tickets rather than what was originally just a piece of paper. Artists will now be able to interact with ticket holders before and after shows and give rewards.

“Our Live Stubs product brings back the nostalgia of collecting ticket stubs while also giving artists a new tool to deepen that relationship with their fans and we can’t wait to see what the creativity of this community dreams up as it grows.” – Michael Rapino President and CEO Live Nation Entertainment.

The first group that will use this feature will be the Swedish superstar trio Swedish House Mafia. As their ticket begin to go on sale for their 2022 tour Paradise Again fans will get to experience the Live Stubs NFT when they purchase a ticket to one of the group’s shows.

Taylor Rains/Insider



I saw a concert for the first time since the pandemic and the large crowds proved live entertainment is back.

Live entertainment was hit hard by the pandemic with companies reporting billions in losses in 2020.

COVID precautions have helped concerts and theater recover breathing life into live shows.

Live entertainment has officially returned since the start of the pandemic and people are eager to see performers on stage once again.

In March 2020 live events like concerts musicals festivals and plays all closed their doors in the wake of COVID-19. Companies like AEG Presents and Live Nation Entertainment which owns promotion entity Live Nation and ticketing giant Ticketmaster were some of the hardest hit by the pandemic. In 2020 Live Nation reported only $1.86 billion in revenue totaling an 84% loss compared to its $11.55 billion 2019 income according to its annual earnings report.

While ticket sales are low ticket retention is high. According to Live Nation 83% of fans have held onto their tickets for postponed shows while 63% have kept festival passes. Going forward Live Nation has empowered artists and performers to require attendees to be fully vaccinated or provide proof of a negative COVID test to enter rescheduled shows.

In August 2020 only 6% of Americans felt comfortable going to a concert in the US according to Statista but now that vaccines have proven effective many people are excited to get back into the music scene including me.

In September I attended the Foo Fighters' 26th-anniversary concert tour in Bridgeport Connecticut and they put on a phenomenal show. Seeing a band live again for the first time since 2019 was thrilling and even though standing should-to-shoulder with hundreds of people initially made me feel uncomfortable I trusted the vaccine to keep me safe.

While the show was outdoors fans had to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test to enter the arena. This was the only part of the event that made me remember COVID existed other than that it was like I was back in pre-pandemic times – there was no plexiglass few to no masks and no social distancing as fans stood together in the mosh pit belting the lyrics to Everlong with the legendary Dave Grohl.

No barriers at the bar and employees were not required to wear masks

On June 20 the Foo Fighters performed the first full-capacity concert in NYC since the pandemic signaling a return to some sort of normalcy in Manhattan. The band played at Madison Square Garden and attendees were required to show proof of vaccination to enter the show according to the New York Times allowing fans to rock n' roll without social distancing or masks.

Before live music's return artists had to get creative when connecting with fans during quarantine. For example technology company Redpill VR developed a platform that puts live music in virtual reality while David Guetta put on ""United at Home"" concerts from New York and Miami that were live-streamed without a physical audience. Digital theater also made its debut with the Los Angeles-based Blank Theater's virtual production of ""Hard to Love.""

The Foo Fighters maximum capacity concert is a sign of life for live entertainment proving that these events can be done safely with COVID precautions. Broadway which initially said it was only shutting down shows through April 2020 reopened for masked vaccinated performances recently. Meanwhile comedian John Mulaney's ""From Scratch"" tour sold out Boston's Wilbur Theater in a record-setting one hour in August according to Boston.com.

While live events are back there is still hesitation from some individuals to attend. CNBC reported Broadway's ticket sales are slow to recover with box-office hits Wicked and The Lion King failing to sell out on their opening week. However according to Market Watch low sales could mean cheaper tickets as well as make it easier to snag a coveted Hamilton seat.

I hear a lot about MetraPark not just my work but in the community. And one of the things I hear most is “Why does Missoula get all the good concerts?” Looking back a few decades I suppose I might have wondered the same thing and maybe that’s why my wife and I started the Magic City Blues festival all those years ago. I’ve learned a lot since then (to put it very lightly) — not just about what it takes to book artists but about how the entire live music industry works.

To start the acts choose us we don’t choose them. And in this industry it all starts with the artist. But most people don’t know there is a plethora of parts pieces and circumstances that have to fall into perfect place for a show to actually happen.

So here it is: Concerts 101 by yours truly. I’ll start with the players: the booking agents the promoters and the landlords (that’s us).

The job of the booking agent is to represent the artist. Their goal is to book the tour and sell the show to the local talent buyers find the venue and negotiate the price. Imagine nailing down all the details — given the fact that shows at MetraPark are usually booked well over a year in advance.

Promoters fund the tour and buy the shows. Seems straightforward but it’s a delicate balance. Their goal is to have a sold-out show but make sure that no one is left without a ticket. They also need to make sure the artist gets paid well but that they themselves are also profitable.

We help them scale shows appropriately based on what we know works in our region (Kesha versus Manheim Steamroller) and historical data.

And it’s not just spectators who come to MetraPark (and/or Billings) to see shows artists also bring huge entourages. For one recent memorable concert Luke Combs rolled in with his band crew and technicians in six buses and 14 semi-trucks worth of equipment.

Teams of technical experts turn the performances into the experiences that the audience has paid to see. MetraPark helps source the local hands. They help unload the trucks install the rigging trussing and grids so that they can hang the screens PA speakers and lights. Our team of event coordinators also facilitate catering and act as mini project managers lining up the additional needed labor through the local stagehand union Rimrock Stagehands.

As ""landlords"" we work closely with the other ""players"" — sometimes for years in advance to see ‘holds’ turn into real events. Promoters reach out to us and reserve certain dates for when their ‘artist’ is going on tour and could potentially be in the region. It’s not uncommon to have two or three holds on a certain night or weekend.

It’s important to remember these concerts or shows can’t be scheduled during MontanaFair graduations the NILE Stock Show Wrangler Team Roping or other important community and cultural events that take place.

Once a show is confirmed (‘holds’ go to first come first served) we make sure the venue is ready to host the event. We plan and facilitate security and concessions. We also assist in event promotion and ticket sales.

When it comes to concerts specifically we don’t profit from ticket sales. We only make what we are able to negotiate with the promoters and concessions. As far as concessions sometimes we make money and sometimes we break even once we cover operational costs. But it’s not really the point — we’re in it for the long term which is to bring great concerts and performers to Billings.

How? We court national promoters like Live Nation AEG and Pepper Entertainment as well as local promoters like the Pub Station. They are our life blood and without them there are no shows.

I hope I’ve shed a little light on the whole industry surrounding live entertainment. We rent out our facilities provide the labor the insight assistance where needed and hopefully an experience that allows the promoter to make a dime and artists to give their best possible performances. Because that means they’ll come back and ideally encourage other shows to come here too. That’s the game right? The more shows we get the bigger the variety and the better it is to live in this community.

The live music entertainment industry is a huge economic generator for us and Billings really is the arts and entertainment center of the state. The real beauty though is the show itself — the unforgettable intimate lovely symphony that is great live music big shows big sets — and all of these people coming together to share these experiences.

Then the lights come on. The strong workers the stage decks the miles of cable the planning and frustration that sees all these pieces finally fall into place… it all goes away. And that’s just how it should be.

Artists have to art after all.

“The President made clear his desire to have constructive relations with Turkey and to find an effective way to manage our disagreements” a senior Biden administration told reporters.

The official said topics of discussion included Afghanistan Syria Libya the South Caucuses climate human rights as well as Turkey’s request to purchase U.S. F-16 fighter jets.

On the subject of the jets Biden was “very clear that there was a process underway that we had to go through” the official said.

In 2019 during former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration the Pentagon kicked Turkey out of the F-35 program because of its purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems. Now Ankara wants to buy 40 F-16 fighter jets made by U.S. company Lockheed Martin and nearly 80 modernization kits for its air force’s existing warplanes.

U.S. lawmakers have urged the Biden administration not to sell F-16s to Turkey saying Ankara has “behaved like an adversary.""

“This meeting is important for President Biden to send some messages to Turkey about what is and is not acceptable behavior from a NATO ally” said Rachel Ellehuus deputy director of the Europe Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She said Biden will convey his expectations for Turkey as a partner in a range of issues including security challenges following U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan its role in the Black Sea region and performance in NATO.

Bilateral relations between the two NATO allies have also been strained over human rights. As president Biden has pledged to restore human rights and democracy as pillars of U.S. foreign policy. In August of last year before taking office then-Democratic presidential candidate Biden advocated for a new U.S. approach to the “autocrat” Erdogan. Ankara slammed the comment as “interventionist.”

Since then the two leaders have taken a more pragmatic approach to maintaining a relationship. Biden is keen to avoid another escalating flashpoint in the region following the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan while Erdogan is embattled politically at home.

“The Turkish economy is faltering he [Erdogan] is actually losing in popularity” Ellehuus said. “Whether he'll admit it or not I think he needs to be perceived as having at least a cooperative relationship with President Biden.”

This is the second in-person discussion between the leaders under the Biden presidency following a June meeting in Brussels on the sidelines of the NATO summit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZGMudXJiYW50dXJmLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9ibG9nLzQ4LW1pbGxpb24tYS1wb3J0aW9uLW9mLW10LXZlcm5vbi1zZWxscy1iZWNvbWVzLXByaWNpZXN0LWhvbWUtdG8tc2VsbC1pbi1kYy8xODg5NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$48 Million: A Portion of Mt.

The new owner may be Georgia businessman Wayne Johnson who said that he had a letter of intent to buy the property about a month ago. The home located at 7979 East Boulevard Drive was owned by Robert Stevens and Michelle Stevens. Stevens is the former CEO of Lockheed Martin.

The listing includes a 16000 square-foot main house as well 400 feet of water frontage a three-bedroom guest house a fully reconstituted carriage house with four parking spaces and a studio apartment a waterfront dock and reproduction of English colonial boxwood and rose gardens.

River View dethrones the former McLean estate of AOL co-founder Jim Kimsey as the priciest home sale in the region. That home sold for $45 million last January.

The simple explanation for this is that most of the time the one taking the photo is on the ground while the aircraft in its natural element. But from time to time we do get to see what hides on top and in some cases the view is just as impressive as the one from below.

What you’re looking at in the main pic of this piece (click photo to enlarge) is a C-5 Galaxy flying out of the same place these winged beast usually call home the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. An Airman 1st Class flying in an undisclosed plane nearby at a slightly higher altitude managed to snap a photo of it showing to the world the up side of the plane a look just as impressive as all others when it comes to this particular beast.The Galaxy was flying to a date with a KC-135 Stratotanker with the 121st Air Refueling Wing flying out of Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base in Ohio as part of an exercise that eventually saw the C-5 connect with two of these flying gas stations.The C-5 is one of the oldest military transport airplanes in operation. It was born all the way back in the 1970s but it is presently at the center of a massive modernization effort conducted by Lockheed Martin. Coming out the other end of this process as the C-5M Super Galaxy the airplane is likely to be kept into service for at least three more decades.The thing will get new engines and avionics but the overall capabilities in terms of cargo will remain about the same. The Galaxy can take off weighing as much as 920000 lbs (417305 kg) with the plane itself tipping the scale when empty at 380000 lbs (172365 kg)."

As one of the world’s leading high jumpers she has become a 12-time US champion who also counts a world indoor gold among her many accolades but her impact goes far beyond the field of play. The four-time Olympian’s achievements in the athletics arena may have provided a platform but her experiences determination and fight now mean she is a champion for so much more.

In June 2019 the then 35-year-old was diagnosed with breast cancer but her battle had begun almost a year before that when she found a small lump but was told she was too young to have a mammogram. At that time it was diagnosed as a lymph node and so she returned home relieved and ready to undergo the required treatment to make it go away. Only it didn’t.

Throughout October she has been supporting Breast Cancer Awareness Month but the 2008 Olympic bronze medallist – who is also a motivational speaker – is constantly championing change. Now cancer free she knows that early detection is key.

“It was a tiny rice-sized lump that I knew hadn’t been there even two weeks or the month before” Lowe explains. “The doctor just looked at me and was like ‘no you need to gain some weight’ and he said not to come back for six years” she adds with mammograms usually only recommended for women over the age of 40.

“So I believed him and thought ‘oh good but that was a scare. Let me eat right let me do everything that I always promise myself that I’m going to do’. As an athlete we know our bodies and when you say lymph node then I’m going to go and do all the research and figure out how to make this lymph node get smaller. But I’m doing all the things and it’s getting bigger.”

Eleven months later she went back to the doctor and had to really push for further investigation. They eventually did the test and found the lump had tripled in size. She was immediately sent for a biopsy.

“I go for the biopsy and it was so hard because we had just lost Gabe” she adds with the US distance runner and inspirational rare cancer advocate Gabriele Grunewald having died just days before.

“It turned out that it was breast cancer and it was a very aggressive form of fast-growing breast cancer.”





One in eight

The World Health Organisation states that as of the end of 2020 there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous five years making it the world’s most prevalent cancer. Among the statistics Lowe shares is that one in eight women in America will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.

“One in eight – that’s absurd” she says. “When I learned that statistic I also learned that African American women are 40 per cent more likely to die of breast cancer than our white counterparts.”

Now as well as being a global ambassador for the American Cancer Society Lowe has partnered with breast cancer organisation Susan G. Komen and pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly who are taking action to improve breast cancer health equity.

“One of the things that is really important for me is to have somebody that can help navigate things through because as soon as you are diagnosed with breast cancer or as soon as I was they pushed me through this tunnel and everything happened at lightning speed” she says. “My mind was spinning so much that I couldn’t even comprehend the information that they were giving me. So to have somebody who is competent who understands the barriers that are unique to African Americans; that is there put in place. I am not only an advocate for African American women but that is where the need is right now so I am happy about that partnership but I still continue to advocate for all women worldwide not even just here in the US.”

So for Lowe quitting had never been an option. Despite undergoing a double mastectomy and chemotherapy she continued to train through her treatment as she targeted a return to competition knowing the profile that would bring in raising awareness.

Lowe’s aim had been to compete at a fifth Olympic Games in Tokyo and she made her competitive comeback in March clearing 1.80m at two meetings in Florida. The 37-year-old felt like she was building back well on track ahead of the US Olympic Trials but then she her husband and their three children all contracted Covid-19.

“Having the opportunity to compete in the Olympics four separate times I had seen the huge section dedicated to media” she says. “The world is watching.

“I felt like it was important to number one have a goal to push through (during her cancer treatment). When the days got hard if I ever thought of giving up to have that goal was monumental. But then I knew that if I got there that there would be an opportunity to share this message. I told myself that even if one woman or man heard it and checked themselves and they found a lump and it saved their life and maybe their kids got to keep their parent that was enough for me.

“I have had a tremendous amount of people reach out to me and say ‘because of you I got my mammogram’ or ‘I was just diagnosed can you please share your experience with me?’ And I talk with them. It’s probably the most rewarding job I’ve ever had.”

Resilience

After all she had been through missing the Olympics due to Covid was understandably hard but putting it into perspective Lowe was focused on surviving.

“I honestly thought I was going to die. This is not something that is comparable to the flu” she says. “This is something that is actually ripping people away from their families and my white blood cell count was still extremely compromised from the chemotherapy. It’s a miracle in my opinion that I was able to fight off Covid and survive it.”

She now uses her platform to talk about her resilience through both.

“I really got pushed into this motivational and inspirational speaking realm and my goal is to continue to raise awareness about breast cancer but also inspire with my journey through athletics” says Lowe who set the US high jump record of 2.05m in 2010. “You would think because of the pandemic that it would get quieter but it has been the exact opposite! So I have been doing a lot of virtual events I do them every single day now and it’s great for me because I really feel like the work that I am doing makes a difference.

“It’s not what I would have chosen for myself obviously you don’t want to be the spokesperson for breast cancer. However being put in this situation and experiencing it first-hand allowed me to put myself in the place of other women or men who may experience it because they have it themselves or a loved one has it and I feel like lending my voice kind of helps empower them and so I am willing to do that at any cost.

“I partnered with organisations like the American Cancer Society Komen and Lilly because they are giving me the opportunity to talk to legislators and those that make the laws and the recommendations and share my story” she adds. “Because what I personally want is 18-year-olds getting breast ultrasounds. With mammograms the breast tissue is usually a little bit too dense and so you can’t see things until you are about 40. But those ultrasounds can and so I want to see that changed because I was sitting in chemotherapy at Stage 1 yet there was a girl who was 23 at Stage 3 being treated right next to me. The more research I did the more I was understanding that women are being diagnosed younger and younger and we don’t know why but at the same time right now early detection is our best defence against it. So we have to use what we have and I feel like it’s my job knowing this to fight for that.

“I have been in a very blessed position to have this platform because of the gifts that I have been given as an athlete. I feel that it would almost be a waste of the gifts if I don’t use that platform for good and I feel an obligation to that because the sport of athletics has given me so much. It has allowed me an education to be able to provide a home for my family and to even have the resources – I had my medical insurance because of athletics and to be able to treat and fight the disease I feel like it is my responsibility.”

It is also because of a connection within the sport that she even started doing self breast checks at all. Jamaican sprinter Novlene Williams-Mills had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and Lowe reached out after reading her story.

“Novlene was a great friend of mine even before her own diagnosis” Lowe explains. “I read about her diagnosis and I had the opportunity to be on a bus with her. I was like ‘hey what happened and how did you know?’ Because I didn’t know how to do a self breast exam. I didn’t even know that I was supposed to be doing them regularly at that point. She talked to me about it and told me about her process and so I started doing them because of her.”





Next steps

While Covid denied Lowe the chance to go for her fifth Olympic team she feels she achieved her aim of using it as a stage to share breast cancer awareness through her link with Eli Lilly.

“Eli Lilly supported me going towards that fifth Olympics but for them it was more about giving me their platform to share my story” she says. “When I watched the Olympic Games during the opening ceremonies my video popped up. My kids were like ‘Mommy you made it!’ It was so beautiful because that was the goal. Realistically I wasn’t going to make medals at this Games I just wanted to get there and for them to lend their platform they made that come true – I was there. That commercial ran over and over and I was there and people who were able to see my face could remember the story and maybe remember to get checked.”

She also intends to be there when the World Athletics Championships take place on home soil in Oregon next year.

“It is a huge target” she smiles. “For the world that hasn’t been able to experience the crowd of Eugene Oregon you are going to love it. It is tremendous.

“My goal is to get on that track. I’ve only seen it on TV and I want to get on that track! I started training for real this week and I was surprised; I retained a lot of what I did last year so I am not starting from zero.

(Abbie Parr/Getty Images)

Utah football announced on Tuesday that it is retiring jersey No. 22 to honor Aaron Lowe and Ty Jordan.

Lowe and Jordan both wore No. 22 while playing for Utah. The high school friends and teammates from Mesquite Texas died via gunshot wounds nine months apart in the past year.

Jordan a running back died on Dec. 26 2020 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound that was ruled accidental. He was 19 years old. He had recently been named Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year after tallying 723 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns in five games during 2020's pandemic-shortened season.

Utah set up the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship in his honor after his death. Lowe was the scholarship's first recipient for the 2021 season. A sophomore cornerback he switched his jersey number from 2 to 22 to honor his fallen friend.

Lowe killed buried next to Jordan

Lowe died on Sept. 21 after being shot at a Salt Lake City-area house party. Police later arrested 22-year-old Buk M. Buk on multiple charges related to Lowe's death including aggravated murder. He was buried next to Jordan in their hometown of Mesquite.

Utah plans to honor both players with a jersey-retirement ceremony during Saturday's home game against UCLA. It will be the first jersey number retired in program history. The program has also created a separate Aaron Lowe Memorial Scholarship in addition to Montgomery's. Per the school the scholarships ""will be given to current Utah Football players each year who exemplify the qualities of Jordan and Lowe.""

The entire conference joined in to honor the players too by painting the hashmarks at the 22-yard line at every stadium across the Pac-12 red.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8va3Nsc3BvcnRzLmNvbS80NzEzMDcvdXRhaC1mb290YmFsbC1pbnN0YWxscy10eS1qb3JkYW4tYWFyb24tbG93ZS1kZWNhbC1vbi10dXJmLW5lYXItdXRlcy10dW5uZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah Football Installs Ty Jordan Aaron Lowe Decal On Turf Near Utes Tunnel,"SALT LAKE CITY – The Utah football team continues to honor the lives of Ty Jordan and Aaron Lowe with many different ways this season.

The latest is that the program installed the decal on the turf that is in the southeast corner of Rice-Eccles Stadium near the Utes’ tunnel.

It’s the decal that has the number 22 with the first two being flipped to form the shape of a heart. The letters “TJAL” are inside the heart and “forever” is below that with the block U.

That was installed earlier this week leading up to the game against UCLA at Rice-Eccles Stadium.

That is one of the many things that the Utes have done to honor Ty Jordan and Aaron Lowe. Utah Athletics has established scholarship funds in both of their names. They will retire number 22 between the first and second quarter of Saturday’s game and UCLA and many more things that are planned by the program.

Earlier on Saturday the five other Pac-12 teams that are hosting football games painted the 22-yard line hash mark red in honor of Jordan and Lowe.

Those words were hard to hear. They were my daughter’s words of despair when she received the worst news of her life: The baby she was carrying suffered from grave defects. That sweet baby named Lila was diagnosed with gastroschisis a dangerous condition in which her intestines were developing outside her body. She also had only one healthy kidney and her very small size indicated that she might have a fatal genetic anomaly.

And Camille was indeed young: 21 years old. She married her high school sweetheart while she was in college and she got pregnant her senior year. All this sounds unusual especially in an era when Americans are getting married and having children at older ages than ever before but marriage at a relatively young age fit Camille. She was always an old soul and so was her husband. They were mature beyond their years but this moment felt different. The news about Lila was terrifying — crushing actually.

I didn’t really know what to say in response. I knew she’d rise to the occasion but I could see in her eyes that she wasn’t ready for a motivational speech. When you get bad news there are times you don’t need encouragement so much as empathy. All I could think to say was “No one is old enough for this news. There is no right age for this challenge.” We cried we prayed and then we prepared. Our daughter was becoming a mother in the most difficult of circumstances.

And it was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen.

Her first concrete decision as a mom was to refuse amniocentesis. Though she desperately wanted more information about Lila the thought of any additional risk to her baby was too much for her to bear. She’d find out Lila’s true condition when she gave birth; then and only then would we know if she’d live.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9mb3J0LXdvcnRocy10YWxsZXN0LWJ1aWxkaW5nLXNlbGxzLWp1c3QtMTItM20tYXVjdGlvbi1zdHVubmluZy1wcmljZS1kcm9w0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2ZvcnQtd29ydGhzLXRhbGxlc3QtYnVpbGRpbmctc2VsbHMtanVzdC0xMi0zbS1hdWN0aW9uLXN0dW5uaW5nLXByaWNlLWRyb3AuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Worth's tallest building sells for just $12.3M at auction in stunning price drop,"Bargain buy?

Burnett Plaza the tallest building in Fort Worth Texas has been purchased via foreclosure auction for $12.3 million just three years after it was sold for more than $137.5 million according to the Dallas Business Journal.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Roaring To $55M-$56M Opening After Strong Saturday – Sunday AM Box Office Update,"EARLY SUNDAY AM: Moviegoers weren’t monkeying around this weekend making a destination to cinemas to see Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. The movie had a lot of gorilla testosterone and held in there on Saturday amassing an estimated near $20M per non-Disney sources which is a -10% ease against previews/Friday of $22.2M. Many believe that will get the 20th Century Studios‘ sequel to $55M-$56M at the top of the pic’s range. Great job Disney and that’s off a B CinemaScore and 79% Rotten Tomatoes audience score.

That hold yesterday for Apes gives rivals hope that there’s at least a pulse out there at the box office; many concerned after Fall Guy coming in short last weekend.

That Friday/previews to Saturday hold bests the -13% over the same frame for the last sequel 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which played in the second weekend wake of Sony/Marvel Studio’s Tom Holland and Zenaya title Spider-Man: Homecoming.

In sum Apes movies just hold. 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes posted a -1% ease between its Friday/previews and Saturday while 2014’s Dawn of the Planet of the Apes dipped -8%.

You’ll remember that Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes was to originally launch over Memorial Day weekend but when Warner Bros/Village Roadshow’s Furiosa dated on top of it Disney shifted Apes two weeks earlier and grabbed Imax.

Disney’s campaign for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes started by teasing the scale of the film and introducing the main character Noa. Then shifted to our charismatic villain Proximus Nova and Raka. This was in order to get the audience to relate to the characters. Next strategic reveals were made i.e. Freya Allan’s Mae speaking so as to shock audiences. This then allowed Disney to utilize Mae as a key figure throughout the rest of the campaign.

The teaser trailer was dropped on Nov. 11 with the full trailer during the Super Bowl which ranked on YouTube’s top 10. On RelishMix Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes was the second-most watched Super Bowl movie spot 24 hours after the Big Game ranking after Marvel Studio’s Deadpool & Wolverine 75.4M to 43.2M views. Tickets went on sale timed to March Madness basketball games.

Disney pumped the movie across its verticals i.e. Disney+ FX Hulu NatGeo/Wild ABC ESPN+ and Star with special placements. There was a branded franchise collection on Hulu’s home screen and carousel on Disney+. There were “What a Wonderful Day!” hourly TV spots animated billboards and increased social and nav elements across ABC ESPN FX Nat Geo and Hulu accompanied by ESPN’s custom MLB opening banner ads in-app integration social coverage as well as a UFC pre-show set takeover and in-show graphics. Custom 60-second spots aired during Comedy Central’s The Daily Show with Jordan Klepper. More boost: Disney’s D23 official fan club had an exclusive member event with a themed reception and advance screening.

One intriguing activation entailed Apes on Horseback seen in Venice Beach the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge New York Liberty Park and during the LA premiere. Custom “Caution Apes on Horses” signs were placed in nearby areas.

Other beats in the Disney D-day marketing rollout included digital audio placements during Twitch livestreams custom Roku and Amazon landing pages and IGN Instagram takeover and a Reddit AMA with Wes Ball and cast. There was a TikTok creator partnership created for history buffs nature enthusiasts survivalists and film enthusiasts. The sequel’s Snapchat lens entailed an overlay of iconic landmarks like the Taj Mahal Statue of Liberty and others.

Billboards and signage for the pic were splashed at JFK Airport LAX and Caesars Las Vegas as well as nature takeovers at Brandenburg Gate London Tower Bridge Colosseum Sugarloaf Mountain Gyeongbokgung Palace and more.



Universal’s second weekend of The Fall Guy looks to have declined -51% (now on par with The Lost City) for a $13.7M take with its running cume at $49.7M.

SATURDAY AM: For those hooked on a theory last weekend that star power no longer works in opening films their concerns are further underscored this weekend as a bunch of no-name apes are driving 20th Century Studios/Disney’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to what might be the biggest B.O. opening this May of $52M-$55M. This is all fueled by PLFs and Imax screens which are delivering 44% of the weekend’s till. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits showed that 43% of the moviegoers bought tickets because they love the franchise natch.

We’ll see if a Cannes Premiere this week can lift Furiosa past its current $40M-$50M projection but word of mouth is excellent out of early screenings for the George Miller directed Mad Max: Fury Road prequel. Unlike Disney with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny last Cannes a movie that wasn’t ready for primetime Warners is truly in pole position here to blast Furiosa off.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes posted a very good Friday of $22.2M thanks to late night business which isn’t that far from the first Friday results of Tim Burton’s 2001 version ($24.6M) and ahead of Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M) and pennies lighter than War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M). However the Wes Ball directed version of the 56-year old franchise gets a B Cinemascore and 3 1/2 stars/77% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak so hopefully these apes don’t lose their muscle. On a whole 85% of the CinemaScore audience gave Kingdom an A or a B. That’s one of the lowest grades for an Apes movie in the millennium down there with Burton’s which got a B-. Rotten Tomatoes’ audience score has eased to 79%. Still good on Disney for getting this movie opened their first try with the franchise post 20th Century Fox. Despite the audience exits there’s confidence at Disney for the sequel to arrive at the higher end of its projections due to its better-than-expected Friday.

Social media monitor RelishMix detected mixed to positive word of mouth before Kingdom‘s opening. That said on the bright side: “Fans anticipating the sequel seem excited primarily because of one thing — sheer love for the past three films. ‘This looks freaking incredible. I gotta rewatch all the previous ones before this comes out. These movies are so cool.’ The quality of the past films is driving immense interest in this one” ‘This is one of the best franchises ever made. Every movie was awesome. A near-perfect trilogy. I was not expecting a fourth installment but man this looks great!’ Whatever direction the Apes franchise goes next it looks like fans will follow.”

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes saw 64% men turnout with 18-34 year olds repping 57% of the audience with the 25-34 year old segment being the biggest demo at close to a third. Solid diversity demos in 35% Caucasian 27% Latino and Hispanic 22% Black and 9% Asian. Those moviegoers going bananas for this sequel were in the South South Central and West. AMC Burbank is currently the highest grossing theater in the nation with $67K.

The social media universe for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stands at 331.6M followers across TikTok Facebook X YouTube and Instagram. Compared to other action sci-fi comps Kingdom‘s smu runs 24% above genre norms but below recent pics such as Dune: Part Two (575.7M) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (508.8M) and even Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (393M).

Ryan Gosling in ‘The Fall Guy’ Universal Pictures

Universal’s second weekend of Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s Fall Guy is eyeing $14.4M -48% a very good hold. The second weekend is better than Lost City‘s -51% but a little lighter as that Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum film posted $14.7M. The pic’s slither out of the gate had more to do with the marketplace and the insider type of movie that it was and less about stars — it was Gosling’s third highest opening of his career. Some were even put off by the mixed genres. “It’s a problem when you’re pushing a romantic comedy and a majority of men show up” sniped one rival studio source.

Elsewhere there’s Briarcliff Entertainment’s comedy satire Not Another Church Movie booked at 1108 theaters which had no P&A spend and is resulting in $120K Friday and a $300K 3-day. Critics didn’t think it was funny at 17% on RT nor did moviegoers at 44%. Johnny Mack wrote and directed the movie which stars Mickey Rouke as the Devil Jamie Foxx as God and Kevin Daniels as Taylor Pharry.

FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Knock on wood but this summer release looks to be meeting its tracking projections. Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

The rest of the top five is as follows:

2.) Fall Guy (Uni) 4008 theaters Fri $3.6M 3-day $14.5M -48% Total $50.5M/Wk 2

3.) Challengers (AMZ) 2609 theaters Fri $1.55M 3-day $5M -34% Total $38.3M/Wk 3

5.) Godzilla x Kong (WB/Leg) 2531 theaters Fri $700K 3-day $3M -34% Total $192.3M/Wk 7

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL2ZlZHMtYW5kLWlycy1nby1hZnRlci1kaWNhcHJpb3MtcGFsLWNodWNrLXBhY2hlY28tb3Zlci1kb2xsYXI4bS10YXgtZGVidNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feds and IRS Go After DiCaprio's Pal Chuck Pacheco Over $8M Tax Debt,"You might recognize Hollywood bigwig Chuck Pacheco as a member of Leonardo DiCaprio’s so-called Wolf Pack or as it is alternatively known the “Pussy Posse.”

Pacheco who is not only a producer but a high-powered talent agent and sometime actor—he has appeared in The Hangover and Entourage—has worked with Martin Scorsese Bruce Willis Mike Tyson and Elvis’ granddaughter Riley Keough and runs in the same circles as Ben Affleck Nick Cassavetes and Woody Harrelson. He has made headlines for among other things tangling with paparazzi while partying with Jamie Foxx.

But there appears to be a far less-glittery side to Pacheco’s seemingly charmed life. According to a bombshell search warrant affidavit obtained by The Daily Beast the movie mogul also allegedly owes nearly $8 million in back taxes to the IRS which has been unable to get its money because Pacheco claims he’s broke.

While Pacheco’s tax preparer was telling the government that his client “had a bad year… and has no money” federal investigators say Pacheco whom they describe in the warrant affidavit as “an avid gambler” is as flush as he’s ever been instead having spent many times the amount of his outstanding tax debt on fine art fancy cars and Las Vegas card tables. (The IRS says it has been trying to collect from Pacheco for so long the original revenue officer assigned to the case has now retired.)

The ongoing investigation into Pacheco’s alleged criminal activity has not been previously reported. The feds accuse him of a laundry list of violations including conspiracy to defraud the United States of America money laundering bank fraud false statements tax evasion subscription to a false tax return aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return and attempting to interfere with the administration of internal revenue laws.

“We have no comment” Ciaran McEvoy a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles where the investigation is taking place said in an email on Friday.

Pacheco has not been charged according to court records. McEvoy declined to provide additional information about whether any charges are in the offing.

Pacheco referred The Daily Beast to Nathaniel Hochman the attorney representing him in the matter. Hochman declined to comment on the record for this article or to make Pacheco available for an interview.

However a source close to Pacheco who has direct knowledge of the situation called the case “total BS.” The IRS has “mischaracterized” parts of the narrative included in the affidavit according to the source who told The Daily Beast that Pacheco disputes the exact amount he owes believing his actual liability is less than $2 million.

Pacheco the source said has already had his paychecks garnished for more than $700000 and has more than enough equity in the multiple homes he owns to cover his debt completely.

“Chuck didn’t do what they’re saying he did” the source argued. “He just didn’t. The government has not brought criminal charges in almost two years. If they thought this was such a strong case they would have brought the case two years ago.”

For its part the IRS says Pacheco made a few scattered payments that failed to make a dent in his obligations and has been ducking its agents ever since.

The IRS processes some 130 million individual tax returns annually but resources are tight and enforcement is selective. In 2023 the agency’s Criminal Investigations division (IRS-CI) opened just 104 cases. Accordingly the IRS focuses its limited resources on going after high-profile names in large part to create a deterrent effect on others thinking about shortchanging Uncle Sam. Criminal prosecutions of A-listers tend to make headlines as do those involving B-listers C-listers and even D-listers. The IRS Criminal Investigations division boasts an 88.4 percent conviction rate explaining “Publicity of these convictions provides a deterrent effect that enhances voluntary compliance.”

In October 2015 Pacheco filed a tax return for the previous year claiming net income of $19238098 from gambling and withholding in the amount of $60852 according to the affidavit. It says Pacheco calculated he owed the IRS a total of $7102674 for 2014 which took into account a $100000 payment he had already submitted.

Having not gotten payment an IRS revenue officer called Pacheco’s tax preparer a Woodland Hills California CPA-cum-lawyer named Jeffrey Helfer who “allegedly committed numerous acts to evade payment of the taxes due and owing to the IRS and to obstruct its collection efforts of Pacheco’s 2014 tax liability” the affidavit states.

“Since April 2016 Helfer made false statements to the IRS on behalf of Pacheco that included that he did not have access to Pacheco’s financial information and that Pacheco was financially unable to pay his taxes” the affidavit alleges. “For years Helfer delayed the IRS’s collection efforts for Pacheco by promising returns and documents to the IRS.”

Helfer did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment.

The revenue officer told Helfer that the IRS had identified accounts in Pacheco’s name at Wells Fargo Bank of America JPMorgan Chase Bank and City National Bank “as sources from which [it] could potentially collect” the affidavit says. The very next day Pacheco formed an LLC called Nine Nights All-Star Weekend registering it with the California Secretary of State as an entertainment company the affidavit goes on. A week later Pacheco began wiring money to a bank account controlled by Helfer who the following month used a different account to wire several million dollars back to Pacheco according to the affidavit.

In attempts to confuse investigators and keep his money “out of the reach of the IRS” the affidavit claims Pacheco regularly transferred massive amounts of cash over the course of at least four years to Helfer who stashed some of it in attorney-client trust accounts and sent some to bank accounts in Macau and Singapore; Helfer’s adult son who is in the Christmas tree jack-o’-lantern and parking lot businesses; and a private investor he met through Helfer’s brother an accountant.

The money was rapidly funneled back and forth through a series of short-term loans to Pacheco all but one of which were not collateralized or formally documented along with various accounts controlled by Helfer who the affidavit says “often mov[ed] funds with no apparent purpose.”

“Based on what I learned through this investigation I believe that Pacheco and Helfer were moving Pacheco’s money in this manner to avoid IRS levies on Pacheco’s accounts” an IRS investigator writes in the affidavit.

According to the affidavit when Pacheco received funds back from Helfer he never used them to pay down his tax debt but rather “quickly disbursed them from his account to pay his debts at casinos or with gambling associates buy art or pay his American Express credit card bills.”

In one example Pacheco bid $2045000 on a piece of art at a Christie’s auction on May 8 2016 wiring the money roughly six weeks after that the affidavit states. Although it provides no further details about the work in question a review of the official auction results show only one piece sold that day at that price: Tripod a nine-foot fiberglass resin and steel sculpture by American contemporary artist Paul McCarthy.

On May 11 2016 the affidavit alleges Pacheco purchased another piece from Christie’s this time with a $1150000 winning bid at an auction that included works from the collections of publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The feds say Pacheco made good on the payment the following month transferring the money from his All-Star Weekend account to a personal account at First Republic Bank then wiring the funds to the auction house from there.

Pacheco also spent millions on artworks at Sotheby’s outbidding others at a Feb. 10 2016 auction in London according to the affidavit. Investigators say he later wired a partial payment of $1534561.73 to Sotheby's from his personal account at Wells Fargo followed by another $1379431.86 to cover the balance.

The IRS says it tracked millions more that Pacheco used for personal luxuries over his IRS debt listing among a slew of other pricey expenditures a $469000 wire to the Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in Las Vegas Nevada; a $939000 wire to the Aria Resort and Casino also in Vegas; and a $350000 wire to luxury car dealership Whittington Motor Sports.

“The equity in the properties the IRS has liened [is] over $10 million” the source close to Pacheco told The Daily Beast. “At any time the IRS could have enforced the liens forced a sale of the properties and paid itself in full. They have never done this and could do it today if they wanted. As such it doesn’t matter what Pacheco… does with the rest of [his] money or assets.”

One of the “gambling associates” named in the affidavit is billionaire investor Alec Gores who hired John Legend to perform at his star-studded December 2016 wedding to powerhouse writer/director/producer Kelly Noonan. In this instance according to the affidavit the money flowed only one way to the tune of nearly $11 million from Pacheco to Gores who is not accused of any wrongdoing.

Another gambling buddy is identified in the affidavit as Bosko Djordjevic a Serbian “film director and cinematographer who participated in high stakes poker games.” Again instead of paying the IRS Pacheco in October 2016 wired $1.1 million to Djordjevic and dipped further into his secret cash reserves that same month to wire $950000 to the Bellagio.

A third late businessman and poker icon Sam Magid received a $110000 check from Pacheco in 2017 according to the affidavit.

At a meeting with Helfer on Feb. 2 2017 the IRS collection officer told Helfer that she planned to file liens a week later on Pacheco’s properties in order to satisfy his tax debt the affidavit states. On Feb. 3 2017 Pacheco sold his condo on the Las Vegas Strip for $1.1 million according to the affidavit. The funds were deposited that same day into Pacheco’s personal account at Wells Fargo after which he immediately “made multiple transfers” from there into three different business accounts he also maintained at Wells.

Soon after the IRS pushed forward with an intent to levy the next step in the lien procedure Pacheco moved more than $3 million from his personal accounts into ones controlled by Helfer according to the affidavit. It claims Helfer then shifted much of the money back to one of Pacheco’s corporate accounts which were not subject to the IRS levy again frustrating the IRS’ attempts to collect the affidavit says.

Helfer according to the affidavit would spend “years” promising the IRS that Pacheco’s subsequent tax returns “would include net operating losses that when carried back would result in no tax due for 2014. This never came to pass.”

In late September 2016 Helfer submitted Pacheco’s 2015 return to the IRS along with a form requesting a “tentative refund” along with Pacheco’s “revised second amended income tax returns for… 2013 and 2014” according to the affidavit.

“However” the affidavit contends “even with the carried back losses the 2015 form 1045 showed Pacheco’s tax liability for 2014 remained at more than $5 million.”

Helfer would continue running interference for Pacheco telling the IRS over and over in 2016 that payment in full was on its way according to the affidavit. The affidavit includes a slew of excuses Helfer floated for delay after delay claiming when an IRS representative inquired about why such a large balance remained due that his cellphone was out of range and that he would call back when he got to the office.

“When [the IRS officer] called Helfer’s office at 10:45 a.m. Helfer’s assistant told her Helfer was out of the office at a meeting” the affidavit states.

Later that day Helfer called back and promised Pacheco “would send in a voluntary payment” according to the affidavit. Helfer insisted that an IRS lien would “destroy Pacheco’s business opportunities” and that Pacheco would make good on the tax bill within 60 days it says. The following month Helfer vowed Pacheco would be sending a check in a week which allegedly never came. A month after that Helfer swore payment “was forthcoming.”

Three weeks later Helfer claimed to have sent a check for Pacheco but said “it must have been sent to the wrong office thus he would stop payment on that check and issue a new one” according to the affidavit. In mid-January 2017 having not received any payments at all the IRS officer on the case called Helfer whose assistant said he was out of the country until the end of the month.

At the end of her rope the affidavit says the IRS revenue officer handling the Pacheco case issued levies on “all known bank accounts held in Pacheco’s name.” Throughout 2017 the IRS continued to place levies on Pacheco’s bank accounts and garnished his wages throughout 2018 “but got little to satisfy Pacheco’s tax debt.”

When the revenue officer retired in April 2019 Pacheco’s collection case was transferred to a new IRS employee according to the affidavit. But having not received an updated power of attorney form from Helfer “for months after requesting it” in March 2020 the new revenue officer showed up at Pacheco’s house unannounced.

“In sum Pacheco [said] he would apply for a payment plan to pay his outstanding tax debt and referred [the revenue officer] to Helfer” the affidavit states.

A year later the IRS still hadn’t received its money. In April 2020 Pacheco submitted a list of his assets to the IRS claiming his eponymous corporation was worth $0 that he had about $250000 in personal assets that consisted of “misc furniture/personal effects” and that he did not own or lease any vehicles. Yet according to the affidavit Pacheco in fact had two leased Bentleys and owned more than $9 million worth of art he bought between 2016 and 2020.

Around this same time Helfer contacted the IRS arguing that a series of deductions Pacheco had claimed in a number of revised tax returns newly submitted for past years in fact brought his total debt down to $1.8 million according to the source close to Pacheco. But the IRS never told Helfer or Pacheco if they had accepted his claims and wouldn’t confirm things one way or the other.

In the summer of 2022 Hochman Pacheco’s attorney met with the IRS and federal prosecutors the affidavit states. Nearly two years later the case still remains unresolved. Prosecutors this past week filed for an extension of time to search Pacheco’s AOL email account for further evidence backing up their allegations.

In the meanwhile Pacheco is only getting deeper and deeper into the hole.

“As of June 29 2023” the affidavit states “Pacheco’s personal liability to the IRS for tax year 2014 was $7833967.46.”"

CLOVIS Calif. (KFSN) -- A new hotel is up and running in Clovis.

The groundbreaking for the new Courtyard by Marriott was back in 2017 but after several delays due to the pandemic and shipping shortages their doors officially opened on August 25th.

The grand opening was Thursday and general manager Hector Ramos said he wants to thank the community for their support and welcome new faces.

""This community and this area has been very open to keeping us open and keeping business alive. A lot of people from LA many places a lot of collegiate sports are keeping this place and people working"" said general manager Hector Ramos.

He said with vaccination rates going up and sporting events taking place they are seeing much of their traffic in the last month.

American Airlines has direct flights from New York (JFK) as well as twice-daily from its Miami (MIA) hub from Wednesdays through Sundays. Delta offers nonstop flights from Atlanta (ATL).

If you are booking for January round-trip from New York for a seat in the main cabin it will cost $644 or 40000 points (+$75.27) roundtrip and $1672 or 170000 points (+$75.27) round trip for business class.

Where to stay

Foreigners visiting St. Kitts and Nevis are limited to a list of seven hotels that have been preapproved by the government. The silver lining of this though is that the list includes some of our favorites including three points hotels: the Park Hyatt St. Kitts Four Seasons Nevis and the St. Kitts Marriott Beach Club. Other options include Paradise Beach and Royal St. Kitts Hotel.

If you plan on staying at the Four Seasons Nevis you won't be able to use hotel points in the traditional sense but you can get extra value and elite-like perks by booking through American Express Fine Hotels + Resorts to which you're given access by holding either The Platinum Card® from American Express or The Business Platinum Card® from American Express.

Hilton's Koi Resort St. Kitts part of the chain's Curio Collection was closed through Oct. 15 but since opening the resort is currently sold out for the rest of 2021. Most January 2022 dates range from $145-200 per night or 42000 to 60000 points per night.

Related: Review of the Park Hyatt St. Kitts

If you want to use points while visiting we love the Park Hyatt St. Kitts which is a Category 7 property in the World of Hyatt program. You can book rooms for 30000 points per night for standard rooms or cash prices start at $754 per night for standard rooms in January.

If you don't already have World of Hyatt points it's easy to get them. The program is a transfer partner of Chase Ultimate Rewards; you can transfer those points to Hyatt. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is offering a sign-up bonus of 60000 points after you spend $4000 in the first three months from account opening.

If you're a Marriott loyalist consider the St. Kitts Marriott Beach Club. It's a Category 6 property in Marriott's Bonvoy program which is a great deal for a beachfront resort of this kind. A free night will run you 40000 points for an off-peak night 50000 for a standard night and 60000 for a peak night. This makes it a great candidate for use of certain Marriott co-branded cards like the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card.

Bottom line

St. Kitts and Nevis have done well in the fight against the coronavirus. The clear guidelines make it easy for international visitors to enjoy everything this destination has to offer.

The designated hotels for international tourists include some of the best on the islands — and there are plentiful ways to get there using points and miles.

Guests cut the ribbon from a cassette tape,"“PPF Group acquired the O2 arena in late 2013 early 2014 and thanks to Mr Kellner I had the privilege of taking on the development of this entire sector. The concept that gradually emerged included the O2 universum congress centre and now STAGES HOTEL Prague. I look forward to all these facilities working at full capacity and in the interest of the community as envisioned in a post-COVID world. Our goal is to make this area a major centre for Prague 9 and opening the hotel has concluded the first part of this regeneration project. The next phases including improving transport access are yet to come. We have to coordinate with the Prague 9 municipal office and the City of Prague which own several of the surrounding plots” commented Ladislav Chvátal from the PPF Group which owns Bestsport.

Also taking part in the grand opening were Tomáš Portlík the mayor of Prague 9 Aleš Lapka from ADR Architectural Studio which designed the hotel and Petr Syrovátko owner of the construction company Syner. The hotel’s design incorporates musical motifs even down to the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the grand opening. Guests were surprised to find themselves cutting the ribbon from a cassette tape.

The CEO of STAGES HOTEL Prague reminded listeners of the unique connection between the three facilities. “This synergy formed the primary concept in designing STAGES HOTEL Prague with the smallest details reflecting the theme of music and the energy from the international concerts held regularly in the O2 arena. The atypical circular floor plan shows a clear connection to the largest concert stage in the Czech Republic just a few steps from the hotel. In February 2022 world-famous composer Hans Zimmer will be performing a show in the O2 arena. His team and orchestra will stay in our hotel and rehearse the whole programme for several days before the concert in the O2 universum. That is the ideal symbiosis we would like to achieve with as many events as possible” said Otakar John CEO of STAGES HOTEL Prague.

The high standards of quality and services along with the unique lifestyle design of STAGES HOTEL Prague also helped lead to a franchise agreement with Marriott Hotels International and its lifestyle hotel brand Tribute Portfolio in April this year. “Being part of the Marriott International chain carries with it a great deal of prestige as well as a huge obligation to adhere to strict quality standards that make Marriott hotels some of the best in the world” added Otakar John.

The hotel’s reservation system opened several weeks ago and the first guests arrive on November 1.

STAGES HOTEL Prague offers 300 rooms with 27 suites as well as a wide range of facilities including six multipurpose conference rooms a modern Backstage Bar with an outdoor terrace and stylish restaurant access to an indoor atrium with a total capacity of 270 guests and a music lounge. It also has a fitness centre and underground parking for 100 cars."

Scott Abrahams at Mastercard explored this question by discussing his company’s activities involving new technologies and improving existing ones. He shared a variety of novel methods including multi-rail payments and blockchain technology which will transform how we pay for goods and services in the future.

Mastercard’s goal is to provide more people with access to financial products and services so that they can live better lives. In this article we discuss what they see for the future of payments.

The engagement of fintech companies has rocketed and digital-only banking is sticking. In September 2021 alone the fintech industry saw a five-year leap in payments in less than a month. As Scott Abrahams puts it ""We are at a point of reset and must think again about how payments get made"".

The rise in digital banking is a sign that people are using mobile devices for most of their payment needs. And it comes down to three main elements; convenience user experience and security.

Convenience is the key

We as consumers are willing to pay more money for a service that saves us time or effort. We want something that works efficiently and quickly without having to worry about our safety while doing it.

User experience also plays a vital role because fintech companies have focused their attention on this area to a great extent especially to make the process of transactions as easy as possible.

The widespread use of fintech is driving a lot of innovation which Mastercard sees as a significant business opportunity. It plans to create cutting-edge technologies on top of its current payment system as an additional layer.

To understand the type of innovations Mastercard is exploring one must look into its recent investments. The acquisitions of Vocalink Finicity and Nets' Corporate Services are indications that Mastercard is increasingly interested in open-banking cryptocurrencies and partnerships to offer extra services.

As central governments and regulators are entering the cryptocurrency arena Mastercard wants to be at the forefront of this movement. It has acquired numerous blockchain systems to improve the consumer experience as people are growingly open to adopting new things. Is it possible that Mastercard could introduce stablecoins into their card network in the future? We'll have to wait and see.

With a focus on accessibility and affordability innovative concepts are undoubtedly on Mastercard's radar. Security and convenience are also at the core of their work. It aspires to achieve more inclusiveness and sustainability through creative solutions. And according to Scott Abraham open banking multi-rail and blockchains may ultimately surpass what they are doing now.

The most serious risk to Mastercard is if it becomes complacent in its role rather than seeking for the next edge which is what keeps it competitive. However it is forward-thinking and innovative because it is well-aware that the newest consumers of today want to borrow and spend money in a different way. As a result Mastercard has the third-highest number of blockchain-related patents in the world.

Mastercard is one of the most recognisable brands around and they have been at the forefront of innovation for decades. Their vision for the future of payments is one that doesn't only improve current payment systems but also takes them to a whole new level.

From open banking mobile wallets and digital currencies to multi-rail solutions Mastercard will continue exploring technologies it sees as having practical use-cases across its payments network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9wYXRyZW9uLWNvbnNpZGVycy1hbGxvd2luZy1jcmVhdG9ycy10by11c2UtY3J5cHRvLWZvci1tb25ldGl6YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patreon Considers Allowing Creators to Use Crypto for Monetization – Bitcoin News,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEwLTMxL2RvZXMteW91ci1icmFuZC1zcGVhay10aGUtbmV3LXN5bWJvbGljLWxhbmd1YWdlLW9mLWJyYW5kc3BlcmFudG_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does Your Brand Speak the New Symbolic Language of Brandsperanto?,"Why did this happen?

England 126 for 2 (Buttler 71*) beat Australia 125 (Finch 44 Jordan 3-17) by eight wickets

Never mind the Ashes Australia's T20I team was reduced to rubble in Dubai as England maintained their hot streak in the T20 World Cup Super 12s. Chris Woakes produced another incisive display of fast bowling in the powerplay before Jos Buttler did pretty much as he pleased during an innings of 71 from 32 balls. The chase was a formality achieved with more than eight overs to spare.

If the game wasn't decided by the toss - teams batting second have now won 12 out of 14 games at this World Cup - it effectively was by new-ball spells from Woakes who finished with 2 for 23 and Chris Jordan (3 for 17). Australia limped to 21 for 3 at the end of the powerplay and although they managed something of a recovery from 41 for 4 at halfway their total looked severely under par.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGpyd3Jlc3RsaW5nLm5ldC9yZXZpZXcvd3dlLXN1cnZpdm9yLXNlcmllcy0yMDAzLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Survivor Series 2003 Review – TJR Wrestling,"The 17th Survivor Series took place at a time when WWE was clearly setting things up for their future. The roster was pretty young with Brock Lesnar in his mid-20s holding the WWE Title although he was a few months away from leaving the company because he just didn’t like wrestling anymore.

This was John Cena’s Survivor Series debut. In the weeks leading up to this event he turned face because he was so popular with the crowd as the cool heel that rapped about his rivals.

It was also Randy Orton’s Survivor Series debut. He was part of the Evolution group with Triple H Batista and Ric Flair while being booked as a heel on the rise. Orton has a long history of doing well at the Survivor Series. It started at this show for him.

Goldberg walked into the show as the World Champion on the Raw brand. It was his only Survivor Series appearance…until his WWE return in 2016.

This is usually the part where I write “I’m using WWE Network to review the show” but that’s not true in this case. I’m using a review I wrote live on November 16 2003. It was several years ago many laptops ago but I try to keep all my files just in case. What I’ll do is leave most of my original play-by-play and analysis while adding new analysis in blue font. The only match that I’m going to re-watch is the Team Austin vs. Team Bischoff match because I remember it being awesome. Since I already reviewed everything else there’s no point in re-watching it all again.

WWE Survivor Series

American Airlines Center in Dallas Texas

November 16 2003

Awesome video package to start with a guy doing a voice over asking if people will survive the night.

Here comes John Cena. Cena raps about the heel team. He says he’s going to put Morgan and Jones in an ambulance. It was a great rap where he talked trash about all the heels. In the entryway is the grave along with a big truck that will dump the dirt into the grave. Following Cena is Benoit Bradshaw Hardcore Holly and then Kurt Angle. The heel team order is Show A-Train Jones Morgan and Brock Lesnar.

Survivor Series Elimination Match: Team Angle (Kurt Angle Chris Benoit Hardcore Holly Bradshaw and John Cena) vs. Team Lesnar (Brock Lesnar Big Show A-Train Nathan Jones and Matt Morgan)

(Pre-match notes: This is a Smackdown match. Angle’s team were the faces. This was Cena’s Survivor Series debut. Lesnar’s teams were all big guys and they were the heels. Lesnar was the WWE Champion at the time and Big Show was the US Champion. )

Hardcore Holly attacks Lesnar on the floor. He sends him into the steel steps. Everybody else is brawling. Holly shoves the ref down. His team pulls him off. Brian Hebner DQ’d Holly for that. He’s out.

Hardcore Holly eliminated by disqualification

(Lesnar injured Holly with a broken neck for about a year. Holly ended up getting a WWE Title shot at Royal Rumble 2004 but did not win.)

A-Train and Bradshaw start in the ring. Boot to the face for Bradshaw. He ducks a kick into the ropes and hits a clothesline from hell for the pin. Less than a minute already two guys out.

A-Train eliminated by Bradshaw

Big Show comes in. Bradshaw into the ropes knee to the back. Big Show pins him with a chokeslam. Bradshaw is out.

Bradshaw eliminated by Big Show

Cena comes in to take on Show. Show tags in Lesnar boot to the face. Into the turnbuckle shoulderblocks. Back elbow by Cena shoulder blocks are blocked. Chop to the knees takes Lesnar down. He opens up on him in the corner with punches. Ducks a clothesline schoolboy gets two. Another one gets two. Brock gets a clothesline. Morgan tagged in. Headbutt and punch take down Cena. Bodyslam by Morgan legdrop misses. Sideslam by Morgan. Tag to Jones. He whips Cena into Morgan who decks Cena with a punch. Bodyslam by Jones. Tag to Lesnar. Powerslam reversed by Cena into the Throwback neckbreaker. Tag to Benoit. He chops Lesnar hard in the corner. Whip across sends Brock down. Snap suplex. Brock hangs Benoit neck first over the ropes. Clothesline sends Benoit down. Tag to Big Show. Press slam by Show. While holding Benoit up he says “Kiss my ass Angle.” Now that’s talent! Chokeslam is reversed into a crossface. Lesnar saves him with a boot. Abdominal stretch for Show. Show gets a legdrop over the throat for two thanks to Angle saving Benoit. Team Lesnar throws Benoit to the floor stomping the hell out of him. Ref sees nothing of it. I love how refs are both blind and deaf. Headbutt by Show then a tag to Morgan. Big boot is ducked dropkick to the knees. Dropkick to the face. Tag to Angle. Rolling Germans on Morgan with the third one being a release one. Dropkick to Jones’ knee. F5 by Brock reversed to a German. All hell is breaking loose. Just Angle and Morgan now. He gets the Angle Slam for three to eliminate Morgan.

Matt Morgan eliminated by Kurt Angle

Jones in he holds Angle. Show goes for a boot Lesnar ducks and Show’s boot hits Angle. Ankle Lock onto Jones sends him out.

Nathan Jones eliminated by Kurt Angle

Lesnar in quickly after. F5 for Lesnar on Angle! Angle is out. We’re down to Benoit & Cena vs. Show & Lesnar. That was very fast paced.

Kurt Angle eliminated by Brock Lesnar

(They had such a great rivalry. I was surprised Angle didn’t last longer in the match but it makes sense considering the other two guys left on his team.)

Benoit’s working the left arm of Lesnar with stomps and headbutts. Hard whip sends Lesnar down. Whip to the corner Lesnar decks him with an elbow. F5 for Lesnar is reversed to a Crossface! Crowd is going nuts. Lesnar rolls through getting a two count for himself. Lesnar shoves him off so Benoit grabs another Crossface. The crowd is going nuts! Lesnar taps out!

Brock Lesnar eliminated by Chris Benoit

(That was such a big moment for Benoit who was a veteran rising star making the WWE Champion tap out like that.)

It’s Cena & Benoit vs. Big Show. “You Tapped Out” chant for Lesnar. Dropkick to the knee of Show. Show back up. Benoit gets a shoulderblock for two. He goes for the Crossface. Show shoves Benoit into Cena. Tag is made. Ref tells Benoit to get out of the ring. Cena hits Show with the gold chain. FU onto Show! Damn! Cena covered Show to win. The winners are Benoit & Cena at 13:15. Post match they shake hands. Huge pop for them.

Big Show eliminated by John Cena

Survivors: John Cena & Chris Benoit of Team Angle

Analysis: *** Very solid match. I enjoyed it just as I thought I would. Cena’s pinfall on Show sets up a feud for them while Benoit making Lesnar tap hopefully leads to a feud between the two. Angle didn’t play a major role in the match obviously wanting to rest his neck. The huge amounts of energy made the match a good choice for an opener. Crowd loved Benoit and Cena the most.

(If you look ahead to WrestleMania 20 it was easy to see why they chose those winners. Cena ended up beating Show for the US Title as the opener and Benoit won the World Title from Triple H in the main event. Benoit didn’t get to have a real feud with Lesnar although they did have a couple of awesome matches together.)

Backstage Vince McMahon tries to talk to Shane. He mentions that they’re wrestling against brothers Undertaker and Kane. Vince asks Shane how he feels. Shane says he feels sorry for Vince. Vince walks out of the room and sees “Stone Cold” Steve Austin. They stare at eachother then laugh. Then stare again. That’s it. No words. Just staring.

Women’s Title: Molly Holly vs. Lita

(Pre-match notes: Molly was the heel champion against Lita as the face challenger.)

I missed the first three minutes or so. Molly’s wearing a cleavage showing top that she usually don’t wear. Molly has Lita in a dragon sleeper-type move. Lita fights out but Molly pounds on her again. Handspring elbow by Molly into the corner. She stomps away. Lita fights out of the corner with kicks flips to the top and hits a crossbody for two. Big clothesline in the corner. She mounts Molly in the corner for the ten punches in the corner. Rollup for Lita gets two. Side slam by Molly gets two. Molly has her in the corner mounts her and Lita fights back with a powerbomb. She must have been watching Undertaker matches before. Side Russian leg sweep by Lita. Moonsault or Litasault misses everything. Molly to the top for the Molly Go Round. Lita kicks out at two. Molly takes off the middle turnbuckle. Lita gets a rollup. She charges Molly trips her and sends her face first into exposed middle turnbuckle leading to the pin. Molly wins it after about 8 minutes.

Winner by pinfall: Molly Holly

Analysis: *3/4 Decent match. The ref Charles Robinson saw the spot where Molly took off the turnbuckle yet he allows her to use it? I don’t get it. I know the refs are idiots but he saw it AND yelled at her about it. I guess Lita wins the title next month.

(I don’t remember anything about it to be perfectly honest. It’s a cheap win for a heel champion and nothing more than that really.)

On another note Tajiri beat Jamie Noble on Heat. Shane vs. Kane is coming up next.

Long video package airs to set up Kane vs. Shane McMahon. The ambulance is shown. Kane is out first. Shane is wearing a white jersey obviously to showcase the blood he’s going to have coming.

Ambulance Match: Kane vs. Shane McMahon

(Pre-match notes: Kane was an unmasked crazy heel at this point. He was angry that he didn’t have the mask anymore and took it out on everybody. Shane tried to stand up to him as a fighting face. They did a lot of stunts along the way in the feud.)

A Shane cross body over the top sends Kane out. Kane tosses him headfirst into the ring steps. He picks up the steps. Shane grabs a chair smashing it into the steps. Kane is down under the steps. Shane drills Kane with a monitor from the Spanish Announce Table. He drills him twice with a monitor. Another shot to the face. Kane is draped over the table. Shane goes back in. Top rope elbow through the table. I know it’s a spot that has been done MANY times before but it’s still damn impressive. Kane sits up soon after as Shane goes through the crowd. Kane follows him. Shane leads him over to an area in the back. They’re backstage now. Shane is running backstage with Kane following him. Didn’t they just go through a table? Kane takes a turn Shane comes from behind with a kendo stick. He hits him with the stick six or seven times. Shane gets into a car. He backs the truck into Kane who falls into a security booth. Shane goes on walky talky then tells them to send it. Slowly an ambulance comes. How exciting.

He drags Kane onto the stretcher. Kane gets up from it. Shane’s plan is unsuccessful as Kane tosses him around. No camera back there. Crowd boos. We’re back. Kane beats the hell out of him down the hallway. He throws him through the curtain. They’re out in the arena again. Kane tosses him off the front of the ambulance. Kane whips him into the ambulance again. Kane goes to spear him into the ambulance but Shane reverses it and shoves him into the ambulance a few times. He opens the back door right into Kane’s head. One more time. Shane tries to shove him but Kane fights out. Boot to the face for Kane. Kane tosses him in the ambulance shuts one door but can’t get the other one closed.

Shane gets a Tornado DDT on the floor. He reaches into some dumpster grabbing a trashcan. He drills Kane with it. He puts a padded black base cover over Kane’s leg. He puts the trashcan on his face. He climbs the ambulance and hits a Van Terminator off the ambulance into Kane’s face. Good thing he had padding. Kane is out. Shane picks him up and shoves him in. He can’t get both doors closed. Kane drags him into the ambulance so that they’re both in. He kicks Shane out. Kane whips Shane into the side of the vehicle. While in Kane’s arms Shane gets rammed back first into the vehicle. Headfirst javelin throw into the ambulance. Shades of Nash doing that Mysterio in the days of Nitro. Crowd chanting for Shane. Tombstone on the floor for Kane just like he did to Linda. He tosses Shane into the ambulance shuts the door and wins it after 13 minutes.

Winner: Kane

Analysis: **1/4 It’s tough to judge this compared to a regular match. They weren’t in the ring for more than thirty seconds. The spots were pretty good as expected. Shane’s athleticism impressed like usual but there wasn’t enough stuff in between to make it anything special. They did a good job of putting Kane over strong so in that sense they accomplished their goal.

(The goal of the feud was to put over Kane as a psychotic heel so in that sense it worked. They relied on stunts so much to try to make it seem different from a typical wrestling feud.)

After the match the ambulance took off to the hospital.

Backstage Josh Mathews asks Lesnar what it felt like to lose. Brock says he didn’t lose. Josh says with all due respect he tapped out. Brock says he didn’t tap out and lose. He wasn’t out there alone. He says he can beat anybody single handedly. Backstage Goldberg shows up. He shakes his hand saying “nice to meet you.” Looks like this is the start of a possible WrestleMania match between the two.

(You were right 2003 JC. It was the tease for their WrestleMania 20 match. At the time of this meeting both guys were World Champions too.)

Jonathon Coachman comes out to the ring for a promo. He is wearing a neck brace. He says that he’s hurt from what the Dudley Boyz did to him last week with the 3D. He says that his doctor said that he’d be okay pretty soon. Before he leaves he points out Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.

Coach goes to interview Cuban. He asks him what he’s looking forward to. Cuban says he’s looking forward to Stone Cold kicking Eric Bischoff’s ass. Coach says it won’t happen. He asks him if he prefers WWE referees or NBA referees. Eric Bischoff comes out saying he’ll handle it. He goes into the ring. He tells Cuban to go into the ring to say it to Bischoff’s face. Cuban goes in. Big pop for Cubes. He’s a fairly fit guy probably bigger than Bischoff. Bischoff says that he rented the building so that tonight he runs the building. He says he can get security to take Cuban out or he can do it himself. He shoves Cuban. Cuban shoves back. Randy Orton comes out to the ring from behind Cuban. RKO on Cuban to some big heat. Cuban sold it well. Fun segment. Crowd loved Cuban as they should because he’s a great owner.

Backstage Evolution is hanging out with some ladies. Mr. Stephanie McMahon seems to be enjoying himself. Orton comes in to say that he just took out a legendary owner in Mark Cuban. Next up he’s going to take out the legendary Steve Austin. Hunter says he will take out Goldberg.

(I don’t remember calling Triple H “Mr. Stephanie McMahon” too often. I should do it more!)

WWE Tag Team Titles: Basham Brothers (w/Shaniqua) vs. Los Guerreros (Eddie & Chavo)

(Pre-match notes: The Bashams were not really brothers but they were heel tag team champions. Eddie and Chavo were faces although Chavo was showing heel tendencies.)

Champs come out first. Challengers are next. Will Chavo be turning heel here? I think so. Guerreros come in first taking out the champs fairly quickly. They go after Shaniqua but the Bashams get them from behind. Chavo starts with Danny. Back elbow by Chavo brings in Eddy. Eddy dropkicks Danny in the corner then stomps the hell out of him in the corner. Eddy gets the rolling vertical suplexes for two. Tag to Chavo. Seated dropkick gets two. Bodyslam tag to Eddy hilo splash gets two for him. Eddy nails the Bashams with his armdrag/head scissors combo move. They reverse a charge sending Eddy to the ground. Shaniqua hits a clothesline and body slam on the floor. She has more moves than Nathan Jones already. Doug works over Eddy in the corner. Tag in to Danny double team slingshot vertical suplex gets two. Chinlock for Danny. Eddy fights out with elbows. Tilt-a-whirl headscissors for Eddy. Tag in to Chavo. Back drop on Danny dropkick to Doug and a tilt a whirl slam for two. They reverse a whip into the corner double flapjack for the Bashams. Doug goes for a spinebuster on Chavo from the top. Eddy saves him getting a hurricanrana. Chavo flips on Doug for two. Danny tosses Eddy over the top. It’s two on one against Chavo. Doug vaults Chavo into the air and he gets a dropkick on the waiting Danny into the face. Cool spot. They’re both down for the eight count. Shaniqua on the apron. Danny switches with Doug in the ring. He dropkicks Danny out. Shaniqua in so Chavo clotheslines her. Eddy gets a frog splash on Shaniqua. Chavo spanks Shaniqua to the delight of Eddy. Chavo gets a swinging DDT but his feet hit Eddy in the face. Danny comes out nowhere gets a rollup with a pull of the tights for a three count at 7:31.

Winners by pinfall: The Basham Brothers

(I wasn’t using the ROLLUP OF DEATH~! phrase back then but you know by now that it’s pretty deadly.)

Post match the Guerreros don’t look too happy. Chavo says it’s not his fault.

Analysis: ** Solid match. One of the better matches that the Bashams have had since they’ve been in the company. Looks like Chavo’s heel turn is going to wait. Should be soon I’m guessing. The last five minutes were really strong making up for the slow pace at the start.

(The heel turn from Chavo was obvious because we could tell WWE was going to push Eddie as a face. I didn’t know it at the time but three months after this is when Eddie won the WWE Title from Lesnar. He split with Chavo and won their feud before getting to Lesnar. I spelled it “Eddy” because that’s how he spelled it but after a while I went with Eddie because that’s how WWE spelled it.)

A video package aired to set up Team Austin vs. Team Bischoff on the Raw brand. The video focused on some of Austin’s best moments.

(Austin retired at WrestleMania 19 earlier in 2003. He was so popular that WWE felt the need to bring him back as a co-GM of Raw along with the heel Bischoff.)

Bischoff’s music starts. His entire team comes out together. Glass breaks here comes Team Austin coming out together. These guys got the biggest pop of the night thus far. The crowd busted out into several chants back to back. One for Austin HBK RVD Tables and Booker T. as well. That was cool. Stacey Keibler Long and Bischoff are in one corner while Austin is in the other.

Survivor Series Elimination Match: Team Austin (Shawn Michaels Booker T. Rob Van Dam Dudley Boys) vs. Team Bischoff (Chris Jericho Christian Mark Henry Scott Steiner Randy Orton)

We start out with Christian against D’Von. Whip into the ropes for Christian shoulder tackle. Slap to the face by Christian. D’Von takes him down quickly. Leaping clothesline by D’Von gets two.

Mark Henry eliminated by Rob Van Dam

Into the turnbuckle RVD leaps over Orton but it doesn’t work because Orton decks him with a clothesline. Boot to the face by RVD. Springboard kick by RVD followed by a Rolling Thunder.

It’s 3 on 3 as D’Von enters. Sideslam by D’Von. To the top a headbutt gets two for him. Blind tag brings in Jericho who gets shoulder blocked down by D’Von.

Christian distracts D’Von he turns around and Jericho gets a spinning sleeper/neckdrop for the three count. D’Von Dudley is out.

D’Von Dudley eliminated by Chris Jericho

(This is another nerd writing thing but I usually wrote his name as D-Von instead of D’Von so not sure what I was doing in these days.)

Bubba comes in. He gets a big sideslam for two. He tags in Shawn Michaels who is in the match for the first time. Chops to Jericho in the corner. He does the ten count in the corner. Christian comes in so Shawn leaps off the ropes with a double axe to his face. Jericho tags in Orton. They do a double shoulderblock to send HBK down.

Huge heat for that.

Chris Jericho eliminated by Shawn Michaels

(I loved Jericho’s feud with Michaels in 2003. Their 2008 feud was even better but that 2003 rivalry was great because it really elevated Jericho and made people take him more serious as a legit threat as a heel.)

Orton comes back in drapes his arm across the chest and he gets only two! Another good nearfall. Orton to the top. He goes for a crossbody Michaels ducks and Orton hits the referee. HBK’s face is all red. This is a MASSIVE blade job. I can’t say it enough. It’s like his bloody face at Hell in a Cell #1. Bischoff comes in kicks HBK in the ribs. Austin comes into the ring throws Bischoff out and gives a Stunner to Orton. Ref sees none of it. Crowd is going NUTS. Austin takes Bischoff to the back brawling with him. Batista comes in through the crowd and hits a huge sitout powerbomb on HBK. Orton crawls over for the cover. Ref wakes up one…two…three! Team Bischoff wins at 27:27. Austin shows up in the aisle looking at what happened. He never saw Batista.

Shawn Michaels eliminated by Randy Orton

Survivor: Randy Orton of Team Bischoff

Analysis: ****1/4 This match was very exciting especially at the end. The last fifteen minutes of it was filled with the kind of drama that you’d expect from a match involving this many talented people. Shawn Michaels put on an outstanding performance. The finish was something that was predictable yet it worked really well. The effort of Jericho Orton and Christian shouldn’t go unnoticed either. They did a terrific job in telling the story of the match. Very good match. The best of the night so far easily.

(That was a wild few minutes of action especially at the end. Michaels was incredible trying to fight back against three guys and nearly pulling it off. I like how the win was really cheap for the heels because they needed Bischoff and Batista to help Orton get the win. I don’t think it hurt Orton that much because he was seen as a star on the rise. This was a huge win for him. I’m just really impressed with how well booked it was because it helps to accentuate the great work in the ring.)

After the match JR talks about how Austin’s 14-year career is over now. Does anybody really believe that? Austin comes back into the ring looking over Michaels. Shawn stumbles to his feet shakes Austin’s and they walk out together. I can’t say it enough about Michaels’ blood. When he was walking out of the ring you could see the blood all over his body not just his face.

Austin’s music strikes up again. He walks out to the ring. He looks very somber. He says that he started his career back in 1989 right there in Dallas. He says that he didn’t want it to end this way but he feels justified because it started in Dallas and he appreciates everything that the fans have done for him. He thinks it’s fitting that it has ended in Dallas. He says there’s been good times bad times and he’ll go on the record as saying that “I loved the shit out of you guys.”

As he goes to pose Jonathon Coachman comes out on the mic with a bunch of security guards with him. He asks Austin how does it feel to know that he’s finished with the WWE. Austin punches him gives a Stunner to a security guy and kicks all their asses. He clears the ring of everybody but Coachman. He stomps Coach down in the corner. Kick to the gut middle finger and a Stunner. He drinks some beer to end it.

(Cool moment honoring Austin in Texas and then having Coach get beat up as well. Austin ended up returning as an authority figure in a role as the “Sheriff” of Raw.)

Video package sets up crazy Vince McMahon of the Smackdown brand and his problems with The Undertaker. Tazz has his keys to victory. He highlights Undertaker’s submissions and home-field advantage. For Vince he says “avoid the hole.” Good tip. Undertaker comes out first. Vince is next with his hands together as if he is praying. He kneels down in the corner praying for himself and looking up. Rules are simple: Put the guy into the hole that is by the entryway fill him up in dirt by using the dump truck and go from there.

Buried Alive Match: Vince McMahon vs. The Undertaker

(Pre-match notes: Vince was the crazy heel that had several matches that year to help boost Smackdown and Undertaker was the face.)

Undertaker starts out with a big right hand. Vince is already bleeding. After one punch? He follows with many more punches in the corner. As usual the blood is flowing a lot from his head.

(It may be one of the fastest blade jobs ever. Vince is crazy.)

After two minutes Undertaker has thrown about forty punches. He rams Vince groin first into the ring post. Vince’s entire face is full of blood. You can’t see any part of his face. It’s just all blood. A HUGE crimson mask. Undertaker rams him groin first into the other ringpost. He pulls his knee around the ringpost. Vince’s head gets slammed face first into the Smackdown announce table. Undertaker chokes him out with a video camera cord. Elbow to the head. Undertaker clears the announce table picks up a TV monitor and drills Vince with it. Six minutes in Undertaker has just walked around on offense the entire time. No offense for Vince yet. Undertaker walks back to the gravesite while Vince is laying in the ring. Undertaker grabs a shovel and then walks back to the ring.

Vince turns around as Undertaker swings and drills him in the head with the shovel. Undertaker places Vince’s ankle onto the ring steps. He grabs the other ring steps then slams them onto the left ankle of McMahon. Undertaker picks up Vince on his shoulders. He carries him on his shoulders down the aisle to the gravesite that is near the entrance. He dumps Vince onto some dirt. Vince tosses some dirt into the eyes. What is he Mr. Fuji? Vince gets a low blow. Undertaker is about an inch away from being in the grave. Vince grabs a shovel. He hits Undertaker in the chest with it. Undertaker falls in. He gets back up. The grave is up to his waist. He tosses Vince in. Undertaker goes to the dump truck but an explosion happens. Kane comes out. He shoves Undertaker back into the grave. Vince goes into the loader Kane lifts up his arm to signal and Vince dumps all the dirt that was in the truck back into the grave. Vince McMahon wins after about 12 minutes.

Winner: Vince McMahon

Analysis: * Very boring match. Some may call it methodical but I’d call it bad. Obviously this set up a Kane/Undertaker match at WrestleMania XX. It’ll be interesting to see how they build to that.

(This was the last match for The Undertaker as the biker dude “Big Evil” because when he returned for WrestleMania 20 against Kane he was back to the “Deadman” look. In other words they buried this character and resurrected the other one. It was a pretty good three years for Biker Taker but I think most people wanted him to be the traditional Undertaker again.)

A long video package sets up Goldberg vs. Triple H for the World Title. Hunter is wearing his groin supporting shorts. Flair is with him. The video package and entrances alone took about six minutes. The match is probably going to be less than that. Goldberg comes in last.

World Heavyweight Title: Goldberg vs. Triple H w/Ric Flair

Goldberg jumps HHH at the start. He gets a spear right away. Goldberg takes out Flair. Goldberg clotheslines HHH over the top. He rams him shoulder first into the steps. Press slam drops HHH’s head on the guard railing. Kick to the gut by HHH into the ropes and Goldberg meets him with a powerslam. Press slam by Goldberg but his right leg gave way on him. He drops HHH. Hunter chop blocks the back of the right leg. Hunter tosses him to the floor. Head first into the steps. Hunter drapes the right leg on the steps. He picks up a chair and slams it onto the ankle. So he’s repeating spots from the match that happened just before this one?

Flair attacks Goldberg outside slamming his right leg into the ringpost. Another chop block by HHH. He stomps on the right leg. Hunter drops the elbow across the right leg. Flair chokes Goldberg while Hunter distracts the ref. Hunter works over the ankle with some knees and stomps. He chokes him over the ropes. They exchange punches in the corner that Hunter wins thanks to kicks to the ankle. He sends Goldberg to the floor. Flair aims at him and drills him with a knee to the ankle. Flair rules. More stomping by Hunter. Running knee onto the ankle. Half crab by HHH. Goldberg is in the ropes but the ref doesn’t stop it. Nice job Earl Hebner. Hunter tries to ram Goldberg’s leg into the post. Goldberg pushes him back into the barricade. Back in Goldberg fights off a hold with some punches. He fights out with punches. Charging clothesline by Goldberg. They’re both down. Hunter charges at him Goldberg goes to powerslam him but Hunter sneaks out. Chop block to the knee. Figure four is reversed by Goldberg’s foot. Hunter runs into Hebner. Flair tosses some brass knux to Hunter. Hebner rolls over to count. Two count. Hunter dropped an elbow to the back of Hebner. He goes to the floor and grabs a sledgehammer. Goldberg boots him with his right foot. Flair to the top gets thrown off by Goldberg. Clothesline to Hunter then to Flair. Goldberg uses the sledgehammer to hit Flair in the gut. Batista comes in to take a sledgehammer to the gut. Orton comes in takes a gut shot. Pedigree reversed into a backdrop. Goldberg tosses the sledgehammer out of the ring. Spear by Goldberg. So much for selling the ankle injury. Jackhammer by Goldberg. Hebner wakes up from his nap makes the count for the one…two…three at 11:45. Crowd wasn’t into the match as much as they were for some of the others.

Winner by pinfall: Goldberg

Analysis: *1/2 The psychology of Hunter working on Goldberg’s ankle was a nice touch. However it all becomes meaningless when Goldberg does his two major moves that require his ankle a great deal. They did accomplish their goal of putting Goldberg over strong. I give them credit for doing that the right way.

Goldberg celebrated with the World Title to end the show.

(I remember it as a boring match and just reading it back now shows me that’s exactly what it was. I think Triple H is a very good performer but he wasn’t able to carry Goldberg to an entertaining match which is part of the reason Goldberg only spent one year in WWE. When a top guy with a lot of power doesn’t think much of you that’s bad for your future in WWE. Goldberg was critical for years after he left WWE too so there was definitely some animosity. Obviously they patched up those differences because time heals all wounds.)

The show had a run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes.

FINAL THOUGHTS

– The crowd wasn’t into the nearfalls of the main event very much. There wasn’t a whole lot of heat during the match. The most reactions seemed to happen whenever Flair interfered and the crowd would react to that by yelling “WOO” at him. I don’t blame them. Hunter and Goldberg’s second major match was nothing out of the ordinary. Considering it was main eventing a major PPV like Survivor Series the subpar main events were disappointing. Once again that’s why it led to Goldberg leaving the company because I don’t think management was that impressed by him.

– I really liked the elimination matches. The opening Smackdown match was an energetic well-booked match that saw the right people go over. In a tag setting heel champions like Lesnar and Show can afford losses. That’s what happened.

– The Raw elimination tag match was outstanding. Smart booking with terrific nearfalls several memorable spots and a finish that left fans wanting to see what’s next. Most of us didn’t expect Austin to be done after that but we had no idea how they would bring him back.

– It’s notable that they teased two WrestleMania matches at this event. The first one came when Goldberg went up to Lesnar in the back with both of them holding the major titles. The other one came when Kane helped Vince beat The Undertaker. It’s good to tease stuff that far in advance because it builds up the excitement even more.

– Kane beating Shane the way he did was the right booking for him. The unmasking of Kane was like a resetting of his character and they couldn’t afford to book him like a loser against a non-wrestler like Shane. The feud was cheesy with all the stunts and props they used.

Show rating (out of 10): 5.5

The two elimination matches were the highlight of the show. Most of the rest of the card was below average stuff.

Namibia added another historic day to their journey with a win against Scotland in their first Super 12s game. In many ways that was one of their easier games if only because it was the third time they were playing Scotland in October. From here on in life won't be as familiar. Their next opponents Afghanistan are the only team in the group that had any proximity to the Associate scene over the last decade. Even then the last time these teams played each other was in 2017

In a tangible sense that would make Sunday very hard on Namibia especially the quality of spin that Afghanistan have in conditions that favour them. But from a more optimistic lens it's a chance for them to try and spring some surprises of their own. They did have to beat a Test-playing nation in Ireland to get this far in the World Cup and beating another one will be a feat they'll look forward to.

The hurdle is that Afghanistan have some big-ticket T20 names in their ranks - players who have traveled the world and showed their wares particularly in the UAE and who ran the best team of the World Cup so far close on Friday . That loss against Pakistan came swiftly and crushingly in the end and the fact that they'll have no time to dwell on it is a potential advantage for them.

In the spotlight

Hazratullah Zazai has two ducks and two 40-plus scores since Afghanistan arrived in the UAE for the World Cup. The latest of those ducks came against Pakistan and forced Afghanistan's top order to take a more risky approach at the start resulting in a sub-par powerplay in which they lost four wickets. His exploits as opener are key for Afghanistan to set up more challenging totals. has two ducks and two 40-plus scores since Afghanistan arrived in the UAE for the World Cup.

JJ Smit has quietly been one of Namibia's most valuable players in the tournament so far. In their last five matches Smit has batted four times without being out and has done a tidy holding job as first-change bowler conceding no more than the mid-to-late 20s in all those spells. He isn't their best batter bowler or allrounder but his utility has allowed Namibia to keep control once they've got it. has quietly been one of Namibia's most valuable players in the tournament so far.

Team news

Afghanistan could be inclined to leave Karim Janat out after he endured four sixes at the hands of Asif Ali on Friday. The experience of Hamid Hassan might be a tempting replacement option but they also have left-arm seamer Fareed Ahmad should they want more variety in the line-up.

Afghanistan: (possible) 1 Hazratullah Zazai 2 Mohammad Shahzad (wk) 3 Rahmanullah Gurbaz 4 Najibullah Zadran 5 Mohammad Nabi (capt) 6 Asghar Afghan 7 Gulbadin Naib 8 Karim Janat/Hamid Hassan/Fareed Ahmad 9 Rashid Khan 10 Naveen-ul-Haq 11 Mujeeb-ur-Rahman.

Namibia have been unchanged for two games and are likely to stay that way.

Pitch and conditions

The forecast has Abu Dhabi's temperature hovering about 32 degree celsius during the start of this afternoon fixture. As always the surface is expected to favour the spinners and the long boundaries make this ground a bowling captain's favourite. Anything more than a par score will take really good batting.

Stats and trivia

The average first innings score in Abu Dhabi during the World Cup has been 127. In all cricket played there this year the average is 162.

In 2021 no team has scored as quickly as Afghanistan have. Their average run rate is 9.1 and they hit a boundary every five balls; the next best team is England with an average scoring rate of 8.6 and a boundary every 5.7 balls.

Namibia have bowled 72.3 overs at the World Cup so far and 40.3 of them have been from left-arm fast bowlers; the left-armers have taken 14 wickets and have an economy of 6.4 at the moment.

Quotes

""When he injured his finger during the warm-up games it was a massive blow for us. The initial report from the specialist was for him to return home for an operation. And he will still get that when he's back but he has decided to stay on and our medical staff is managing that finger as best as we can. So far his decision to stay on has really paid off. He's an inspirational leader and he's put together a few great performances and hopefully that finger can stay intact for another few games. Then he'll probably head home to the [operation] theatre and a long recovery period.""

With the match ending in a stalemate both sides finished the group on four points apiece with the same goal difference (zero) and equal number of goals scored in all the matches (2).

To decide who takes the second and third spots respectively in Group E a penalty shootout was held which India won 4-2.

In the penalty shootout Dheeraj started with a couple of spectacular saves while Rahul KP Rohit Danu Suresh Singh and Rahim Ali scored from the spot.

Earlier in the match Apuia tried to hurl the first attack in as early as the fifth minute but his long-ranger could not pose any threat to the Kyrgyz defence. Two minutes later Rahul from the left flank outran Kumarbai Uulu with sheer pace but eventually Adilet Kanybekov neutralised his effort.

The central Asian outfit sprung into life three minutes later when forward Alygulov Maksat was denied by Narender inside the 18-yard-box five minutes later the youngster cancelled Tapaev Temirbolot’s right-footed curler.

Rahim shielded off Artiukov Daniil before rolling it to an onrushing Vikram whose left-footed effort flew away from the target in the 21st minute.



The forward played another pivotal role a minute later as he passed the ball to Amarjit but the Manipuri midfielder skied his effort after four minutes.

Borubaev Gulzhigit beat the offside trap to outpace Asish Rai from the left but Dheeraj came up with a spectacular save after the half-hour mark to keep the score unscathed.

Both teams headed to the changing room with the scores unchanged at the lemon break.

Kyrgyz Republic resumed with more intent and came close to breaking the deadlock in the 50th minute but Maksat skied his effort.

India appealed for a penalty on the hour-mark anticipating a handball inside the Kyrgyz box but the Maldivian referee Mohamed Javiz paid no attention to it.

India latched on their best possible chance seven minutes later when Deepak Tangri put an acrobatic bicycle kick from handshaking distance only to be thwarted by Kyrgyz goalkeeper Tokotaev Erzhan.

India’s pursuit for the winning goal could have come three minutes later but Rahul’s fierce shot from 30 yards out came agonisingly close to breaching the indomitable Kyrgyz defence only to have ricocheted off the post.

On the rebound Vikram tried his luck but Erzhan jumped to his left to negate the danger.

At the other end Kyrgyz broke away on a counter-attack exploiting a mistake by the defender.

His backpass was anticipated by Sharshenbekov Arlen inside the box and he left it to an onrushing Abilov Ernaz who snuck into the penalty box unmarked. Dheeraj however positioned himself perfectly to save it with his usual composure in the 85th minute.

South Africa now sit pretty at the third position on the verge of breaking into the top-two. Sri Lanka as their captain admitted will now find it hard to get back into reckoning for the knockouts numerically and morally. What a time for South Africa to defy the odds and break hoodoos. Can they sustain this? This can turn into quite a story if they do. This is Rishi Roy taking your leave for the day alongside Pradeep Nikhil Hari and Mukesh. It's time for ""The Ashes in pyjamas"" as arch-rivals England and Australia take each other on in Dubai. Do switch tabs and follow the action - if your heart can take it that is. Cheers!

Temba Bavuma | South Africa captain: It's hard to keep everything at the back of my mind and we had a job to do. We took it deep and it was a good thing that we managed to get over the line. David hasn't done that for us in a while and it's great that he came good at the right time. Shamsi is a good player for us he's been effective all over the world in this format and he's been doing this for quite a while now. I took on the responsibility to soak the pressure. The shot was on but I am a bit annoyed that I couldn't execute it well enough.

Dasun Shanaka | SL captain: It was enough to defend for Kumara. He was nailing his yorkers so I thought he was dependable. Credit to how the South African batsmen played under pressure. We had Wanindu for the death too but we used him up before. Nissanka was fantastic and we know that he's a bright prospect for Sri Lankan cricket. It's difficult for us after this but we have to keep fighting.

Tabraiz Shamsi | Player of the Match - My first Man of the Match trophy in the World Cup so it's a special moment but not to take anything away from Nortje Markram Miller and Rabada they played their parts really well. I haven't had a great number of chances previously but I kept working hard was looking to do something special try and win games for the country. The number one rank doesn't really matter for me I'm just glad that I am bowling well we have one of the finest bowling attacks in the world and I'm just happy to be part of it.

17:36 Local Time 13:36 GMT 19:06 IST: Give me a break cricket! The sedentary period in 2020 doesn't warrant a license for arbitrarily-timed palpitations in 2021! Yet another nominee for ""Cliffhanger of the year"" and David Miller has held his nerve. ""He who panics last wins the game"" a great man once said and the composure of Miller and Rabada to beat the odds under enormous pressure proves it once more. There was a hat-trick playing on their minds and the fact that there was only one recognized batsman left - not to mention all the off-field troubles ailing Cricket South Africa. They've left it out there oblivious to all that ails them off the field. South Africa have prevailed partially demolishing an age-old taboo. Presentations coming right up...

19.5 Kumara to Rabada FOUR South Africa prevail! A back of a length ball a hack at it a top-edge through the would-be cordon but the process matters no more to KG. It matters no more to South Africa who roar in ecstasy as this flies away to the third man fence for four! Within the periphery of the cricket field South African cricket lives on...

19.4 Kumara to Miller 1 run short and into the body Miller is late on the pull gets some bat on it behind square leg for a single. Scores level.

19.3 Kumara to Miller SIX this isn't happening! Ain't no C-word spoiling the Protea party tonight! Allows him room to get under it and Miller butchers that - launches another one into the ocean for a six! How the tables have turned!

19.2 Kumara to Miller SIX he's launched that into the Indian ocean! Picks this from a length and clears his leg his eyes light up as he deposits this over the roof at cow corner for six!

19.1 Kumara to Rabada 1 run backs into the on-side to a length ball and throws the kitchen sink at it gets a thick inside edge through his legs to backward square leg for a single

Lahiru Kumara [3.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack

15 off the final one. Rabada on strike. He might inspire a lot of confidence after that six in the last over. It's a hot pressure-cooker about to burst here at Sharjah. Kumara to Rabada in the final over!!!

18.6 Chameera to Rabada 1 run wide yorker lengther Rabada reaches out and squeezes this out towards long-off for one

18.5 Chameera to Rabada no run is that a wide? It hasn't been given! Just inside the tramline Rabada throws his hands at it and misses

18.4 Chameera to Rabada SIX has he cleared it? He has! A rubbish half-volley and Rabada has cleared his front-leg to launch a demoralizing six over long-off! Game on!

18.3 Chameera to Miller 1 run bottom-hands a half-volley outside off right past Rabada's chest down to long-off for one. That needed to find the rope but it hasn't. Pressure on South Africa.

Hat tricks in both ODIs & T20Is

The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcnVzc2VsbC13aWxzb24tY2FsbGVkLW1lLWFzLXNvb24tYXMtaS1nb3QtZHJhZnRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mason McCormick: Russell Wilson Called Me 'As Soon As I Got Drafted',"To hammer home the point one more time Russell Wilson is embracing all of his new teammates especially the ones tasked with protecting the quarterback. As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ka3BpdHRzYnVyZ2hzcG9ydHMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvbG9nYW4tbGVlLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zaWduLXRoZWlyLXJvb2tpZS1jb250cmFjdHMtd2l0aC10aGUtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmZsLW5ld3MtY2Rj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Logan Lee Mason McCormick sign their rookie contracts with the Steelers,

AVONDALE Ariz. — An 18-year-old man was shot after an altercation with police happened at a McDonald's in Avondale early Sunday officials said.

The Avondale Police Department said officers were sent to the McDonald's on 99th Avenue and McDowell Road to check on Ta’jahi Price who was sleeping in the drive-through around 3:45 a.m.

When officers arrived police said they found Price asleep in the vehicle with a gun.

After police reportedly saw the weapon the area was cleared of any bystanders officials said. Police said the officers made several attempts to wake Price up without opening his vehicle.

When Price did wake up police said there was an ""altercation"" and one officer shot Price resulting in him having two gunshot wounds in the leg.

No one else was injured in the incident.

Officials have not yet said what led up to the shooting.

Avondale police were called to the fast-food restaurant for a welfare check around 3:45 a.m. near 99th Avenue and McDowell Road police said.

When officers arrived they found 18-year-old Ta'jahi Terrion Price asleep inside his car in the drive-thru blocking traffic and causing other drivers to honk their horns.

Police said responding officers could see Price had a visible gun with him in the car. They reportedly tried to wake Price without opening the doors of his vehicle but when that did not work they opened his door.

Police said Price woke up and there was an ""altercation"" with officers. Police said the man grabbed his gun and tried to run off prompting police to shoot him.

Price was shot twice in the leg and suffered non-life-threatening injuries according to police.

On Monday a spokesperson for Avondale police said one officer fired his gun. No officers or others were injured in the shooting incident.

An Avondale police spokesperson told ABC15 crews at the scene on Sunday morning the Incident Response Team is investigating the shooting.

The team is comprised of officers across the area who assist in investigating police-involved shootings to prevent any conflicts of interest. Glendale police will take the lead on this investigation the spokesperson told us.

Avondale police said Monday that charges in the incident are pending and the ""investigation is still being conducted by Glendale PD.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtbWNkb25hbGRzLWp1c3QtcmV2ZWFsZWQtaG93LW11Y2gtaXRzLXJhaXNpbmctaXRzLXByaWNlcy10aGlzLXllYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Just Revealed How Much It's Raising Its Prices This Year,"McDonald's customers should get used to the higher prices at McDonald's this year. The chain has been increasing its menu prices over the last year in order to keep pace with increasing costs of labor and supply and has recently confirmed that the increases from earlier in the year are will carry through the end of 2021.

In the second quarter McDonald's said its prices were up by 6% compared to 2020. In the latest earnings call executives confirmed they anticipate the increase to stay at that level for the rest of the year.

RELATED: At Long Last McDonald's Is Testing This Burger In the U.S. Next Month6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

""We are still seeing [6% increases] and that's pretty much the level we expect for the full-year 2021 over 2020… And that's really to cover both labor cost pressures and commodity cost pressures"" said CEO Chris Kempczinski in response to an investor question about menu prices.

Employee wages at McDonald's have been steadily increasing this year with an initial bump earlier in 2021 of 5%. In the time since they have grown again for a total increase of about 10% so far in 2021. Employees have it even better at company-owned stores where wages have shot up a full 15%.

The wage hikes come in response to widespread labor shortages: McDonald's is having trouble fully staffing its restaurants and has been increasing wages in the hopes of attracting new employees. The strategy has been partially successful but not to the extent anticipated.

Operational cost increases aside however McDonald's has had a successful third quarter with same-store sales up by 14.6% compared to 2019 and the company beating market expectations with substantial increases in both its net income and overall sales.

McDonald's offered a few explanations for the sales growth. According to the company customers are placing larger orders and buying for larger groups. They are also placing more to-go orders. Growth was also driven by increases in menu prices as well as menu development including McDonald's crispy chicken sandwich (which debuted in February) and its hugely successful ""Famous Orders"" line which has not only generated sales but helped to steer customers onto the quickly growing McDonald's app. The BTS meal alone is estimated to have grown the app's user base by 23%.

Make no mistake though: however successful McDonald's latest quarter may have been the company is ready to protect its margins. So expect to dig a bit deeper in your pockets next time you make a McDonald's run.

You know the way the world is going because you're happy it's happening.

Out with the old ways of doing things -- going to work at an office for example -- and in with doing your own thing. All the time anywhere.

I sense McDonald's understands this.

It seems to have realized that people coming to work at its restaurants greeting you as they take your order at the drive-thru and then quickly cooking your food is an outmoded concept.

Instead how about machines doing it all faster than humans ever could?

Well here's a little announcement the global burger chain made last week. McDonald's is now getting together with a very very famous name in tech in order to make the drive-thru more robotic and therefore more crowd-pleasing.

You may remember that McDonald's was testing robot order-taking at its drive-thru in Chicago earlier this year.

A customer experience video showed how glorious it is to be greeted by one of Siri's many cousins. You could tell she was really um loving it.

This was just an experiment right? They couldn't possibly be serious. Could they?

Well now McDonald's seems ready to expand this test to further-flung parts of our great nation. Ray the old ways are just a load of Kroc these days.

Oh I almost forgot to mention the very famous tech name with which McDonald's will now partner.

It's IBM.

Yes the IBM at which a Steve Jobs emissary once threw a large hammer in a famous ad. The IBM that used to be called Big Blue and now seems to be Big Intimidator of Little Companies.

Well McDonald's has just sold IBM its McD Tech Labs -- the engineers that are formerly known as Apprente -- so that IBM can take on the robot-driven drive-thru dream.

As CNBC reported McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski is delighted with how the robot-ordering drive-thru tests have gone. They apparently benefited customers and the remaining staff who still come to work at McDonald's.

Kempczinski offered: ""In my mind IBM is the ideal partner for McDonald's given their expertise in building AI-powered customer care solutions and voice recognition."" He added that the work now required is ""beyond the scale of our core competencies.""

Did you ever think your burger would come courtesy of IBM's Watson and friends? Of course you did. You've dreamed about this moment. The robots will never get it wrong. The robots will always be quicker. And the robots will enhance your emotional relationship with the brand.

That's what AI does. It strives for perfection so that you can offer it uncontrolled love.

Who needs a personal relationship when you can get your Big Mac thirty seconds faster?

Ultimately of course McDonald's is making a wise business decision. If speed is what's required the robots will surely provide it. Even if many of them still don't always grasp such nuances as an accent. (Don't worry IBM is working on that.)

And it isn't just about speed. Just think of how much more personal data may be collected as the AI begins to learn who you are and what you really really like.

But please don't worry about that. The companies insist: ""IBM and McDonald's are both committed to adopting AI responsibly by embedding ethical principles into AI applications and processes to build systems based on trust and transparency.""

Having seen the AI ordering in action I'm still not sure how tolerant I'll be of its essential inhumanity.

But perhaps the people I feel most sorry for are the employees of McD Tech Labs. Now they'll be working for the IBM Cloud & Cognitive Software division.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Financial details and the exact terms of the deal were not disclosed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvbWVyY2stbXJrLWVhcm5pbmdzLXExLTIwMjQuaHRtbNIBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDI0LzA0LzI1L21lcmNrLW1yay1lYXJuaW5ncy1xMS0yMDI0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck beats earnings expectations raises outlook on strong Keytruda and vaccine sales,"The exterior view of the entrance to Merck headquarters in Rahway New Jersey on Feb. 5 2024.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand.

Others who caught on to the humourous translation tweeted the hashtag #FacebookDead.

In explaining the rebrand Zuckerberg said the name “Facebook” just doesn’t encompass “everything we do” anymore. Zuckerberg’s network includes Instagram Messenger WhatsApp its Quest VR headset its Horizon VR platform and more — all in addition to Facebook.

Zuckerberg has described the metaverse as a “virtual environment” you can go inside of — instead of just looking at on a screen. Essentially it’s a world of endless interconnected virtual communities where people can meet work and play using virtual reality headsets augmented reality glasses smartphone apps or other devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vc3RhYm1hZy5jb20vZWxzZXdoZXJlL3p1Y2stYW5ub3VuY2VzLWZhY2Vib29rLXRvLXJlYnJhbmQtaXRzZWxmLWFzLW1ldGEtd2l0aC1rYWktbGVubnktdnItZm9pbC1nYW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zuck Announces Facebook To Rebrand Itself As 'Meta' With Kai Lenny VR Foil Game,"After noting the incredible rebranding success stories of Kanye West (Ye) Cat Stevens (Yusuf Islam) and Puff Daddy (P. Diddy) Mark Zuckerberg announced that his social media behemoth Facebook Inc. would be changing its name to “Meta.”

To aid with the new-age optics he also rolled out a teaser of a forthcoming VR foil game featuring Kai Lenny where two get barreled together and jump boats. “You’ve gotta pump it to jump it” says Zuck before getting second place and voicing his desire to reapply sunscreen.

Per the Associated Press report:

Facebook Inc. is now called Meta Platforms Inc. or Meta for short to reflect what CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday is its commitment to developing the new surround-yourself technology known as the “ metaverse.” But the social network itself will still be called Facebook.

Also unchanged at least for now are its chief executive and senior leadership its corporate structure and the crisis that has enveloped the company.

Skeptics immediately accused the company of trying to change the subject from the Facebook Papers the trove of leaked documents that have plunged it into the biggest crisis since it was founded in Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room 17 years ago. The documents portray Facebook as putting profits ahead of ridding its platform of hate political strife and misinformation around the world.

Social media users in Israel are mocking Facebook’s company name change to Meta as it sounds similar to the Hebrew word for “dead.”

Many Twitter users scoffed at the social media company’s rebrand — revealed by founder Mark Zuckerberg earlier this week — using the hashtag #FacebookDead. “Somebody did not do their #branding research” one post read.

Dr Nirit Weiss-Blatt author of The Techlash and Tech Crisis Communication tweeted: “In Hebrew *Meta* means *Dead* The Jewish community will ridicule this name for years to come.”

“Grave error?? Facebook’s new name Meta means dead in Hebrew. Hilarious. #FacebookDead” another user tweeted.

Zuckerberg’s efforts to revamp Facebook come as the company faces what could be its most potent scandal since it launched in 2004.

The social media giant is under the spotlight following the publication this week of “The Facebook Papers” a series of internal documents obtained by 17 news organizations including CNN that underpin whistleblower Frances Haugen’s claims the company is riddled with institutional shortcomings.

The documents reveal how Facebook has propelled misinformation struggled to eliminate human trafficking-related content on the site and tried to increase its teenage audience despite internal research suggesting that its platforms especially Instagram can have an adverse effect on their mental health.

Facebook isn’t the first company to be ridiculed after its branding didn’t translate abroad.

In 2019 Kim Kardashian West was accused of cultural appropriation after debuting her shapewear brand which she initially named Kimono. Kardashian even appeared to have trademarked the word “kimono” a decision that the mayor of Kyoto Daisaku Kadokawa criticized in an open letter on Facebook.

“We think that the names for ‘Kimono’ are the asset shared with all humanity who love Kimono and its culture therefore they should not be monopolized” Kadokawa wrote.

Kardashian changed the name of her brand to Skims later that year.

In 2017 McDonald’s name change in China raised eyebrows. Customers were left confused when the company swapped Maidanglao a Chinese iteration of the English name to Jingongmen which loosely translates to “Golden Arches.” One customer said it “sounds like a furniture store.”

And when the Nissan Moco was launched in the early 2000s Spanish-speaking customers may have looked twice as the word “moco” translates to “bogey.” Needless to say the name was only used in Japan.

Only two days after being mauled for his vax scepticism in an opinion piece in Australia’s The Sydney Morning Herald Kelly Slater has opened multiple fronts dragging in a who’s who of surfing after responding to Ace Buchan’s comment on a post by Tracks magazine.

Tracks jumped on the Herald piece hard not to when a story is seared to a crunch and served with bread for sopping and ran a pointer to it on their IG account.

Ace who is thirty-nine and a veteran of sixteen WSL seasons (best finish sixth in 2008) ran with what he figured was the voice of reason.

Complex issue and everyone is entitled to their views and choices (whilst acknowledging that their choices in this case have a huge impact on those around then) …but is it not slightly alarming that professional athletes and more specifically surfers are completely over indexing in conspiracy theorists anti vaxxers and spreading of misinformation? A group that also happens to over index in under education over confidence and use of social media to digest and spread media? I wouldn’t listen to a bunch of doctors telling me which board to surf before a heat at Pipe I’d chat to a bunch of my surfer friends ….but I wouldn’t listen to those same surfers tell me what to do and which medicine to take if I hurt myself in that heat I’d go chase the doctors.

And the switchboards lit up.

First Slater who turns fifty in a few months and who’d previously told of friends dying from the vaccine either from side-effects of suicide wrote

@acebuchan I’ve yet to see a surfer giving advice on which medicines to take but feel free to show me. I’m personally against vaccine mandates for people in a free society with what the experts characterise as a leaky vaccine. So I think you’ve missed the point. When virologists and doctors acknowledge that you can catch and pass on covid because you carry a similar viral load when vaccinated we’ve all got every right to be confused and should adamantly be asking questions. I’m not sure where you or anyone else missed the logic there. And I very well could be wrong but am happy to take that ‘risk’ whatever people assume that to be. Insinuating anyone is playing doctor here is a disappointing moment a false equivalence and nothing more than an appeal to authority. Your comment is just an opportunity to virtue signal.

Ian “Kanga” Cairns rough tough big-wave hero squirter of testosterone and lover of big chicken-fried steaks stood behind Kelly as did two-thirds or so of the five hundred-ish comments.

“In an era where Australia is being subjected to incredible levels of suppression of free speech and medical choice” wrote Kanga “@kellyslater should be applauded for taking a public stand for use of alternative treatments and opinions that have always been our prerogatives as Australians.”

Much emotion and distorted angles and enough I think to lend the dullness of daily life an invigorating jolt.

The shouts of New York Jets fans echoed throughout MetLife Stadium and the quarterback realized they were celebrating him.

""At first I kind of had to listen again"" White said with a smile after leading the Jets to a stunning 34-31 comeback victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. “Like are they chanting my name?”

They sure were and for good reason.

White threw for 405 yards and three touchdowns caught a 2-point conversion pass on the go-ahead score and joined Cam Newton (2011) as the only players since at least 1950 to throw for 400 or more yards in their first career start.

“He’s a dog. He’s an animal. He’s a savage” running back Ty Johnson said. ""I told him before the game ’You’re a gunslinger so let’s ride.'”

White starting in place of injured rookie Zach Wilson pulled off the improbable victory for the Jets (2-5) while going 37 of 45 — setting an NFL record for the most completions in a player's first start.

“Going out and watching film at the beginning of the week and seeing what they do on defense I knew there would be completions out there” White said.

He overcame two early interceptions and also became the Jets' first 400-yard passer since Vinny Testaverde threw for 481 on Christmas Eve 2000 a span of 327 games. And he even left for a few plays to be checked for a neck injury.

All that from a backup who was a fifth-round pick of Dallas in 2018 out of Western Kentucky and hadn't thrown an NFL pass until last week. And with Wilson still out for at least next Thursday night's game Indianapolis White will get a chance for an encore.

“Mike is fantastic"" coach Robert Saleh said. “He’s poised he showed it all throughout camp all throughout OTAs that he deserves to be one of those guys and obviously he showed it today.”

With the Bengals (5-3) leading 31-20 in the fourth quarter the Jets got an acrobatic touchdown by Johnson who took a short pass from White and tip-toed down the left sideline and reached over the goal line for a 19-yard score. It was initially ruled Johnson stepped out at the 2 but video review overturned the call and confirmed the touchdown.

White’s 2-point conversion pass to Keelan Cole was incomplete and New York trailed 31-26 with 4:36 left.

Shaq Lawson then came up with the Jets’ first interception of the season deflecting Joe Burrow’s pass and snagging it to give New York the ball at the Bengals 14.

Two plays later White found a wide-open Tyler Kroft in the back of the end zone to give New York a one-point lead.

The Jets went for the 2-point conversion and turned to some trickery with the Jets’ twist on the Eagles' “Philly Special.” Jamison Crowder tossed it to a wide-open White in the end zone to make it 34-31 with 3:45 left.

It all had the fans at a half-filled MetLife Stadium loudly chanting: “Mike! White!”

“He deserved that!” running back Michael Carter said. “You saw what he did out there today.”

The Jets forced the Bengals to punt on fourth-and-19 from the 40. Cincinnati never got the ball back.

“Got outcoached got outplayed today” Cincinnati coach Zac Taylor said. “They’re a hungry team. We knew they were capable of this.”

On third-and-11 Johnson was stopped for no gain on a catch but Mike Hilton was called for unnecessary roughness. That gave New York the first down and White took a knee in victory formation moments later.

“It’s a wakeup call for sure"" Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard said. ""Any team can beat anybody on any given Sunday. We learned that today. It’s a valuable lesson that won’t be forgotten.”

BREAKING THROUGH

After becoming the the first team to go scoreless in the opening period in its first six games since the 2008 Detroit Lions the Jets scored on their first drive on Carter's 8-yard touchdown run.

New York changed up a few things: Offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur was in the booth instead of on the sideline and Saleh chose to take the ball for the first time rather than defer after the Jets won the coin toss.

WHAT AN (ALMOST) CATCH

Cole had the most jaw-dropping non-catch of the season late in the first half.

Cole who stuck out his right hand to catch the ball and pinned it between his legs as he fell backwards for what appeared to be a 12-yard touchdown grab. It was reminiscent of Odell Beckham's now infamous one-handed grab on this same field while with the Giants in 2015.

But a video review overturned the score with officials saying Cole didn't maintain possession — setting off boos on Halloween from the Jets fans.

New York came right back two plays later on Braxton Berrios' TD catch that cut the Jets' deficit to 17-14 with 15 seconds left in the first half.

INJURIES

Bengals: Rookie RG Jackson Carman was carted off in the fourth quarter with a back injury.

Jets: LT George Fant was carted off with an ankle injury late in the second quarter and didn't return. He was replaced by Chuma Edoga.

UP NEXT

Bengals: Host the AFC North-rival Cleveland Browns next Sunday.

Jets: Have a quick turnaround and play the Colts in Indianapolis on Thursday night.

The small but vocal MetLife Stadium crowd began screaming “Mike White Mike White Mike White.”

Who could have ever predicted it?

White the Jets’ unknown backup making his first NFL start threw for 405 yards and three touchdowns as the Jets shocked the Bengals 34-31 on Sunday afternoon.

“At first I had to kind of listen again. I was like ‘Are they chanting my name?’ ” White said.

Yes yes they were.

White won over Jets fans who barely knew who he was last week when he replaced an injured Zach Wilson. Now the question after that performance is should White hold onto the job once Wilson comes back from his knee injury if White can keep playing like this?

It might seem crazy to keep Wilson the No. 2 overall pick benched but no one can deny the Jets’ offense looked better Sunday than it had all year. Heck the offense looked better than it had in several years. White now has as many touchdown passes (4) in seven quarters as Wilson has thrown all season.

In his first career start backup quarterback Mike White threw for more than 400 yards and led the Jets to a win over the Bengals. Robert Sabo

After the game Jets coach Robert Saleh left the door open that White could be more than a short-term replacement.

Zach “Wally Pipp” Wilson?

“We’ll go day-to-day but anything is possible right?” Saleh said. “Anything is possible. It goes back to the theory of the difference between Player A and Player Z is an opportunity and reps. That’s what this league is. That’s professional sports. They come out of nowhere when someone gets an opportunity. What Mike does with his opportunity … he has the world in front of him. He has to take advantage.”

That decision can wait though. The Jets have a game Thursday night against the Colts and Wilson will not be ready to play. White will make his second start this one on national TV.

White’s teammates said they could see this coming from the 26-year-old who has spent most of his career on the practice squad.

“It’s Mike F–king White” running back Ty Johnson said. “He’s a savage. He’s a dog. He’s an animal.”

The result was not just stunning because of White’s performance but also because it came a week after the Jets looked lifeless against the Patriots and the Bengals entered having handily beaten the Ravens. But White and Co. showed resiliency and pulled off a stunning upset coming back from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter.

“During training camp we talked about this football team being young” Saleh said. “There are going to be days where we look like we should be a playoff team contending for a Super Bowl championship. There are going to be days where we don’t look like we belong on a football field. That’s youth. That’s this young team that is growing. … Is this the roller-coaster ride we’ve been talking about since training camp? Absolutely. Is this something to build off? Heck yeah. We beat a really good football team today.”

The Jets are now 2-5 and the Bengals fell to 5-3.

The Jets took the lead late in the fourth quarter after a strong sequence from both the offense and the defense. Trailing 31-20 the Jets cut into the Cincinnati lead with a 19-yard touchdown pass from White to running back Ty Johnson who tiptoed down the sideline to make it 31-26.

On the next series Shaq Lawson deflected a Joe Burrow pass and then intercepted it at the Bengals 14-yard line with 4:32 left in the game. It was the Jets’ first interception of the season.

White gave the Jets the lead with a 13-yard pass to tight end Tyler Kroft. The Jets then made it 34-31 when they ran their version of “Philly Special” with Jamison Crowder after taking a flip from Elijah Moore throwing to White for the conversion.

The defense then came up with a big stop of the Bengals. Sheldon Rankins sacked Burrow on third down forcing the Bengals to punt. On their final possession the Jets got a huge call with just under two minutes left when the Bengals stopped them on third-and-11 but Bengals cornerback Mike Hilton was called for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Johnson that gave the Jets a first down and allowed them to run out the clock.

“Our team was real resilient” linebacker C.J. Mosley said. “There were a lot of times in that game where it could have went a different way. We’ve seen in the past games how we let some games slip away from big plays. Today we showed what winning football looks like.”

While it was a great team win this one will be remembered as “The Mike White Game.” White became the first Jets quarterback to throw for 400 yards since Vinny Testaverde on Dec. 24 2000 against the Ravens. White’s final stat line was 37 of 45 for 405 yards three touchdowns and two interceptions.

The Jets set the tone early with Saleh electing to take the ball after they won the coin toss. The offense went 79 yards on 10 plays with Michael Carter scoring an 8-yard touchdown to put the Jets up 7-0. It was the Jets’ first score in the first quarter this year. White went 7-for-7 on the first drive and showed great poise. He opened the game completing his first 11 passes.

White threw two interceptions but the Jets’ defense was able to mount a goal-line stand after the first one to lift the team. The defense had a nice bounce-back game after allowing 54 points to the Patriots coming up with critical stops early and late in the win.

“The entire defense took it personal” Saleh said. “You always want to take it personal Last week was not indicative of who we are as a defense. I think it was important for those guys to just get back to Sunday and go play ball against a playoff-caliber football team. We’re capable of doing this stuff.”"

However the equipment is constantly evolving making this sport more enjoyable and that’s what BBall technology is all about. Apart from seasoned professionals there are plenty of leisure golfers and this new innovation takes that into account.

Since most golf practitioners are not well-trained they tend to hit poorly angled shots more often. And this might result in loss of balls if they flight/bounce into dense bushes. Moreover losing multiple expensive balls in a round can create distraction and distress which can hamper one’s game. Furthermore searching for the ball in the thick bushes can damage one’s shoes and even prove time consuming.

Hence BBall has come up with a technology to assist golfers and help them get rid of this unnecessary stress. So have a close look at this technology and most importantly find out if it agrees with the USGA or R&A rules?

How will BBall assist players with their golfing?

A high-end technology goes into the making of a BBall that connects with the app on a smart device. Hence all that a golf passionate needs to do is to come within the 50m range from the ball and then get its precise location on the phone. This way tracking the lost ball will become very easy with all the assistance from the smartphone application. Plus this futuristic innovation supports the involvement of AI in golf.

Allegedly this microchip bluetooth using golf ball is the world’s most advanced in its category. Moreover the great thing about this ball is that it matches all the demands of the USGA and R&A. However since these balls are for an average golf lover they still aren’t considered for official tournaments.

Furthermore the BBall is a 2-piece ball and it has the same weight dimension and swing feel like a regular ball. This ball has a dimension of more than 1.680 inches which is the standard criteria set by USGA and R&A. So the players should not feel much difference even when they switch between regular balls and the BBalls. The technology used in this will also show stats like ball speed acceleration etc.

Meanwhile once the battery is dead the balls will play just like an ordinary ball. Hence you can use it until it’s completely worn out. So this is going to be a game changer especially for the average golfers and help their game too.

The operating system brings a new Start menu a refreshed interface and several new features and improvements. It also includes a Chat app powered by Microsoft Teams. This is the default communication app on Windows 11 and it can sit comfortably in the Taskbar. Now that PC owners have had a chance to try it out we'd like to know if they use the Chat app on Windows 11.

In our Windows 11 demo video our senior editor overviews the Chat app. It's a simplified Teams experience for the consumer version of the service. It can send messages make calls and be used for meetings. It's a separate version of Teams that's lightweight and aimed at quick communication.

There's a chance that people weren't familiar with the consumer version of Teams before the release of Windows 11. By having the Chat app appear on the Windows 11 Taskbar Microsoft introduced the app to many potential users. The question is if that translated to people using the app.

Before the launch of Windows 11 we asked our readers if they would use the Chat app on Windows 11. 33.48% of voters said that they would try it out and an additional 16.33% said they'd use it as their main chat app. Another 14.66 said they'd use the Chat app occasionally. Just over 28% of voters said that they wouldn't use the Chat app at all. Now that Windows 11 has been out for almost a month it will be interesting to see if similar numbers appear in our new poll.

If you'd like to use the Chat app but don't know how it works we have a full guide on how to get started with the Chat app on Windows 11.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vaG93LXRvL3dvcnN0LXdpbmRvd3MtMTEtZmVhdHVyZXMtZml4LXRoZW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Worst Features of Windows 11 and How to Fix Them,"Windows 11 is a mixed bag. On the one hand many people would be happier sticking with Windows 10. On the other hand there are some solid reasons to upgrade to Windows 11 right now including better window snapping options more control over virtual desktops and fresh design flourishes such as rounded corners on windows.

If you choose to move to Windows 11 whether via upgrade or clean install you'll notice several significant annoyances including a context menu that makes you click an extra time a hobbled taskbar and a default browser menu that makes it more difficult to switch away from Edge.

These are the worst features of Windows 11 and how to fix or at least mitigate them.

1. Truncated Context Menus Make You Click Twice

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Throughout its history Microsoft has struggled to decide whether its UI should target computer-literate users or dumb things down for the not-so-tech-savvy. In a move that's sure to please everyone who still uses an AOL email address the company has decided to limit the number of items on all of Windows 11's context menus.

In Windows 10 when you right-click a file you'll see just about every possible program you can open it with along with a slew of other options that depend on what apps you have installed. In Windows 11 you see a maximum of five choices for files and not necessarily the most useful choices. If you want to see all the choices you have to click ""Show more options"" or hit Shift + F10.

For example when I right-clicked on a .txt file I was not shown the option to open it with Notepad++ my favorite text editor. I only saw Notepad++ along with several other key choices such as ""Scan with Microsoft defender"" after I clicked for more options. Thanks for the extra click Microsoft.

Apparently Microsoft thinks that after years of having all your choices in front of you your tiny brain cannot handle the data stream anymore lest your head explode like the guy at the beginning of Scanners. Or perhaps Microsoft has been watching too much Marie Kondo and decided on your behalf that having full functionality does not spark joy.

Whatever Microsoft's lame reason you can get the all your options back using a simple registry tweak.

2. Explorer Loses Ribbon Hides Options

The ribbon (right) exposes more choices to the user. (Image credit: Future)

You want the ribbon? You can't handle the ribbon or at least that's what Microsoft thinks. In File Explorer for Windows 11 the company has gotten rid of the ribbon and buried many of the options where it's harder to find them. For example with the ribbon in Windows 10's File Explorer you can find the options to open the navigation pane or details pane under the View tab. But in Windows 11 you have to open the View submenu and then the show menu and it's just less intuitive.

The good news is that at least for now you can get the Windows 10 File Explorer in Windows 11 by changing a registry value. If you use the StartAllBack app a Start Menu replacement which costs $4.99 you can also select this as an option.

5. Start Menu Takes Up Too Much Space

(Image credit: Future)

How about some humility Microsoft? What we want out of Start menu is to give us quick access to all of our programs and then get out of the way. However in Windows 11 the Start menu is designed to be showy rather than functional sitting in the middle of the display by default and taking up more screen real estate for fewer icons than in Windows 10. Even worse Windows 11 makes you click a second time to see a list of all your apps.

I compared the size of the Start Menu on a 1920 x 1080 display on both operating systems. Excluding the height of the taskbar which is about the same the Windows 11 Start menu measured 645 x 740 and housed 18 pinned apps and four ""recommended"" shortcuts a total of 22 icons (with room for 2 more a total of 24). The Windows 10 Start menu measured 648 x 639 and held 30 icons. Better still in Windows 10 you can scroll down an alphabetical list of all your apps right away but in Windows 11 you have to hit the ""All Apps"" button to get there.

Fix: Fortunately there are three good Start menu alternatives. See our article on

how to replace the Start menu in Windows 11.

4. You Can't Resize the Taskbar

Imagine you've been riding a bike for many years you know how to ride just fine and then you buy a new bike and it comes with training wheels soldered on and no gears to choose from. That's the taskbar in Windows 11 which infantilizes users by taking away options they have had for years.

One simple option that Windows 11 takes away is the ability to resize your taskbar. But there is a registry tweak that lets you choose among small medium or large sizes. That's not very flexible but it's something. Also if you're using StartAllBack or Start11 both $4.99 Start Menu replacements you can use those to accomplish this task.

With Windows 11's UI Microsoft is like an arrogant chef who after cooking your dinner instructs the waiter to remove all the salt and pepper shakers from the table because they don't want you changing the flavor of their dish. The software giant wants you to have your taskbar at the bottom of the screen and if you want it on the top or side (as you were able to in previous Windows versions that's just too bad.

Windows 11 does not provide any officially-supported way to move the taskbar. However there's a registry hack that as of this writing will allow you to position your taskbar at the top of the screen with a few caveats. Most notably while the taskbar will sit on the top of the screen if you perform this tweak notifications the calendar and volume menu will still be in the lower-right corner. The Start menu will be on top but align to the left side of the screen.

Also if you use the Start11 Start menu replacement there's an option that allows you to align your taskbar to the top and unlike the registry hack method it aligns the menus with the taskbar.

Fix: If you still want the taskbar on top even with those caveats see our article on how to move the Windows 11 taskbar to the top.

6. You Can't Uncombine Taskbar Icons

(Image credit: Future)

In both Windows 11 and 10 all the windows for one program are represented by a single taskbar button. So if you have four Chrome browser windows open there's just one for all of them. However in Windows 10 there was an option to give each Window its own button complete with the window title in it. In Windows 11 that option is gone.

I prefer having the taskbar icons uncombined because it allows me to get a better sense of what I have open and an easier way to click through to it. Fortunately there is a way around this Windows 11 problem.

Fix: In StartAllBack a Start menu replacement app you can set the taskbar to uncombine by selecting None on the Taskbar tab.

7. Strict Hardware Requirements TPM Needed

(Image credit: Future)

Microsoft's need to make decisions for you in Windows 11 is most evident in its strictly-enforced hardware requirements. Where previous versions of the OS will run on just about any PC of the last 10 to 15 years Windows 11 setup will prevent you from installing it on a system that doesn't have one of its limited list of supported AMD or Intel CPUs which excludes many processors that were sold as recently as a couple of years ago (first gen Ryzen for example).

Even worse Microsoft insists you have TPM 2.0 encryption a feature that many older motherboards don't have. The reason for these requirements is not performance but enhanced security. However if Windows 10 can run fine without TPM there's no reason why TPM can't be optional in Windows 11.

In fact you can get around Windows 11's TPM CPU and RAM requirements by using one of a couple of simple methods.

Fix: See our article on how to bypass Windows 11's TPM requirement. The same steps will bypass the other requirements as well.

8. Changing the Default Browser is Difficult

(Image credit: Future)

It's no surprise that Windows 11 installs with Microsoft Edge as its default browser. However what is annoying is that switching to Chrome requires some manual settings changes at least at present.

On Windows 10 when you switched to an alternative browser you were able to set it as the default as part of the installation. In Windows 11 it's not quite so simple. Not only can Chrome not do this on its own at least at present but there are several different settings to change. If you want Windows 11 to use Chrome instead of Edge for all things you might want a browser for you'll have to manually change the assignment for .htm .html .pdf .shtml and several other file types.

Even after you make the changes in settings clicking a link from Windows search or the widget panel will open in Edge. Fortunately there are workarounds.

9. No Weather Widget in the Taskbar

(Image credit: Future)

Windows 10 shows your current temperature and weather in the taskbar  just to the left of the volume control and clock. I know not everyone likes this feature which you can easily turn off but I love it because it's great to get this information at a glance without clicking anything.

Unfortunately Windows 11 does away with the built-in weather widget instead making you click on its lame widget panel before you can see the conditions and forecasts.

Fix: Install Weather Bar (preferred) or Weather Bug which are both free widgets that live in your system tray and show the temperature. You do have to click them to get the forecast and cloudiness however. Be sure to go into Taskbar settings and set the weather icon to always be on in the ""taskbar overflow"" menu.

10. OneDrive Installed By Default

(Image credit: Future)

Just as Microsoft wants you to use its Edge browser for all your web surfing needs the Redmond software giant also would like you to rely on its OneDrive service for Cloud Storage. With a clean install of Windows 11 OneDrive comes preloaded and set to start every time you boot the operating system.

Unfortunately if you prefer Dropbox Google Drive or just not storing files in the cloud you have a piece of software running and eating up CPU cycles RAM and network bandwidth all the time for no functional reason.

Fix: Right click on the OneDrive icon (it looks like a cloud) and select settings. Then uncheck ""Start OneDrive automatically...""

11. The Default Wallpaper Sucks

(Image credit: Future)

From the green pastures of Windows XP's background to Windows 7's bright blue sky with its vibrant Windows logo and the aurora borealis-like look of Windows Vista the default wallpapers in Windows have always been an important part of its aesthetics.

While not quite as repulsive as the weak-sauce wallpapers in Windows 8 the default background you get in Windows 11 screams ""beta product."" It looks like someone took a wad of blue crepe paper or the output from a frosting gun applied some filters to it. Among the other preloaded wallpaper options not one of them showcases the Windows logo or branding things which would indicate a strong visual identity for the OS rather than just a placeholder.

Fix: There are a lot of choices here but I recommend going back to basics with a variation on the Windows 10 wallpaper (or the 10 wallpaper itself). Wallpaper Cave has a nice collection of free wallpapers to choose from."

N.J. Del.,"National

U.S. residents can search for sites offering COVID-19 vaccines by ZIP code at Vaccines.gov which many states now point to for those seeking nearby vaccine appointments as opposed to county-by-county provider dashboards.

English-speaking residents can text GETVAX (438829) and Spanish-speaking residents can text VACUNA (822862) to find out the three vaccine sites closest to them.

Pharmacy chains across the U.S. — like CVS Walgreens and Rite-Aid — are currently taking vaccine appointments and may accept walk-ins.

Those eligible can schedule booster appointments online at Walgreens (or by calling 1-800-Walgreens) at CVS and at Rite-Aid.

Pennsylvania

The Pennsylvania Department of Health is now using Vaccines.gov as the mapping source to help residents find a vaccine site near them.

Philadelphia

Philadelphia residents may opt to receive their COVID-19 vaccine through the city’s health centers where they may walk in without an appointment. Those who prefer to schedule an appointment can do so by calling 215-685-2933.

Alternatively residents may choose to get vaccinated at Philadelphia pop-up vaccine clinics.

The city also offers in-home vaccination services for people with disabilities and older adults who are unable to leave the house.

Eligible Jefferson Health patients including Philadelphia residents and Montgomery and Bucks County residents may schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments online.

Penn Medicine is providing booster shots to eligible people though it is not currently offering “mix and match” boosters. It plans to offer them in the future in conjunction with CDC guidance.

Penn Medicine also encouraged residents to consider receiving their booster shots from their local pharmacy “due to our limited capacity to provide boosters.”

“Unlike last winter there is ample supply of vaccine in the community” reads Penn Medicine’s guidance “including at retail pharmacies close to your home.”

People can schedule vaccine appointments by calling Penn Medicine’s COVID-19 Vaccine Scheduling Hotline between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at 267-758-4902.

Temple Health which is working to contact eligible patients offers booster shots at Temple University Hospital – Main Campus on North Broad Street and Temple – Roosevelt Boulevard Vaccine Clinic on Roosevelt Boulevard.

Canada will donate 10 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine to the COVAX vaccine sharing facility and donate $15 million to help make mRNA vaccines in Africa.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the donation in Rome this afternoon while attending the G20 leaders’ summit.

Canada also intends to increase its financial support to COVAX to buy another 63 million doses itself.

In all between financial contributions and direct delivery of doses Canada says it will help deliver at least 200 million shots of vaccine by the end of next year.

Vaccine equity is a big issue on the table at the summit with warnings from the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization among others that inequitable distribution of vaccines will postpone the global economic recovery and make it very uneven.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi the host of this year’s summit said in his opening remarks Saturday that the inequitable delivery of vaccines is “startling.”

On average the G20 nations have fully vaccinated about 55 per cent of their populations. Canada has fully vaccinated 74 per cent of its entire population.

Globally 38 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated. In Africa it’s not even six per cent.

“These differences are morally unacceptable and undermine the global recovery” he said.

Stuart Hickox Canada Director at the anti-poverty organization ONE Campaign said the number of booster shots administered by the world’s wealthiest countries is already twice as high as the number of first doses given out by low and middle-income countries.

“While we are already talking about third doses here half of the world still awaits a lifesaving first shot. It’s great to see the Government take these urgent steps” he said. “The pandemic won’t really end here at home until it ends everywhere.”

Canada previously promised to donate 40 million excess doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines the latter of which is still in development.

All of those doses are to come from supplies Canada procured but which haven’t yet been delivered. Canada also has about 19 million doses in federal and provincial freezers far more than it needs to finish fully vaccinating everyone over the age of 12.

Pediatric doses for younger children are coming in new shipments because the dose is one-third the size and need to be supplied in different vials.

Canada also donated $515 million to COVAX to buy up to 87 million doses itself including $75 million for distribution costs and supplies such as syringes and needles.

Canada has thus far delivered 3.4 million of those promised doses including 2.7 million via COVAX and the rest through bilateral agreements with other countries including Jamaica Ecuador Barbados and Peru.

It’s not clear yet how many doses COVAX has purchased from Canada’s donation. Securing supply of vaccines is tricky in large part because wealthy countries snapped up most of the early production of COVID-19 vaccines.

All those delivered so far are AstraZeneca doses. J&J has suffered from production issues and Novavax has not yet been authorized anywhere.

Canada ordered 44 million doses from Moderna and about 30 million have been delivered.

In addition to the new doses Canada will also donate $15 million to a new technology transfer hub for mRNA vaccines being built in South Africa to help teach African companies to manufacture vaccines like those made by Moderna and Pfizer.

Globally 1.3 billion doses were promised to COVAX from wealthy countries but only 150 million have been delivered.

World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus asked the G20 leaders on Friday to immediately donate another 550 million doses so that 40 per cent of the world population can be vaccinated by year’s end.

“Promises aren’t translating into vaccines reaching the people that need them” he said in an open letter that was also signed by Prince Harry and Meghan the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

“We can’t simply hope for the pandemic to end on its own” they said reminding people that as the virus continues to spread the risk of new riskier variants rises.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a media release on Saturday that as there is no need for persons to receive the same vaccine for their booster shot as they had received for their previous two doses this latest measure is open to all persons who had completed their first two doses with either the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccine at least six months ago.

The vaccination centres offering the Moderna vaccine are: Buona Vista Community Club (CC) Hong Kah North CC Kebun Baru CC Potong Pasir CC Punggol 21 CC Radin Mas CC Tampines East CC Woodlands CC and Yew Tee CC.

Meanwhile the Ministry of Manpower will also schedule booster vaccination of all dormitory dwelling migrant workers and non-dormitory-dwelling workers in the construction marine processing sector.

Appointment booking for Sinovac vaccine begins

Those who wish to take the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine can begin making their appointment from Saturday. They must be aged 18 years and above and are unable to be vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines.

Once registered an SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the mobile number used to register interest and individuals may use the link to make an appointment at the vaccination centre at Raffles City Convention Centre or at any of the 11 public health preparedness clinics offering Sinovac.

Those who have previously taken at least one dose of the Sinovac vaccine at authorised private clinics can continue to take the remaining doses at those clinics. They can book their remaining appointments from Monday.

Seniors aged 60 years and above may also walk into the vaccination centre at Raffle City Convention Centre to receive their Sinovac doses from Sunday without the need to register for interest or make an appointment.

Booster shots reduce risk of infection by at least 70 per cent

As of Wednesday among those invited to take boosters 80.2 per cent of those aged 60 years and above 92.7 per cent of those aged 50 to 59 years and 75.1 per cent of those aged 30 to 49 years have received their booster dose or booked an appointment.

Tracking 685083 fully-vaccinated seniors above 60 years old between 15 September and 22 October MOH studied the COVID-19 positive infection rates of those who have received their booster doses against fully-vaccinated individuals who have not yet received their booster doses.

The ministry found that booster doses reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection by about an additional 70 per cent and the risk of severe infections by another 90 per cent compared to those who have received only two doses of vaccines.

Comparing individuals who are fully vaccinated and boosted against unvaccinated individuals MOH said that estimates are that the fully-vaccinated and boosted individuals benefit from vaccine effectiveness of about 80 per cent or more against COVID-19 infection and about 99 per cent against severe illness.

Hard seltzer is here to stay experts say but the craze that swept the nation is officially over.

Hard seltzers like White Claw became hugely popular in 2019 leading major brands to follow suit.

But now the category has become oversaturated and only a handful of brands rule the market.

After roughly three years of hard-seltzer domination Americans' love of the canned beverage may be fizzling out.

Molson Coors has nixed Coors Seltzer. Truly's parent company is dumping ""millions of cases"" of the hard seltzer. And beverage industry experts are warning that the seltzer craze is on the way out as sales wane across the sector.

It's a cool-down for a category that took over the alcohol industry as recently as 2018 spurring major investment from beer companies and inspiring almost too many upstart seltzer brands to count. And while hard seltzer sales may have boomed in 2020 as the pandemic kept people either at home or outdoors that momentum is waning in 2021.

Here's where the seltzer craze began – and why it's appears to be over.

Seltzer goes from struggling upstart to nationwide craze

Hard seltzers have been around for years – Bon & Viv launched in 2013 and even White Claw and Truly have been on the market since 2016.

But it wasn't until 2018 that the seltzer craze took off due in large part to people posting about White Claw on social media. The hashtag ""#ClawLife"" was born and then in 2019 YouTuber Trevor Wallace made a parody video dubbing 2019 ""White Claw summer"" and cementing the catch-phrase ""ain't no laws when you're drinking Claws.""

Sales of seltzer skyrocketed and White Claw sales alone quadrupled from $154.8 million in 2018 to $627.2 million in 2019 according to Bloomberg.

By the end of summer 2019 White Claw was in short supply leading its parent company Mark Anthony Brands to invest $250 million ramping up production.

The seltzer craze had officially swept the nation luring everyone from fraternity bros to the gluten-free. Analysts were predicting that sales of Truly would grow threefold by 2021 and the brand's parent company Boston Beer Company inked a deal with the National Hockey League. By October 2019 Truly announced it was overhauling its flavors in an attempt to snatch some market share from White Claw.

At the same time Natural Light and PBR announced plans to roll out affordable hard seltzers of their own and Four Loko promised a hard seltzer with a staggering 14% ABV.

UBS estimated at the time that hard seltzer could grow to be a $2.5 billion beverage category by 2021.







2020 brings about new seltzer brands – and heavier drinking

Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)



By the first quarter of 2020 the seltzer market was officially saturated. Constellation Brands – the owner of Corona Kim Crawford wines and Svedka vodka – launched Corona Seltzer spending $40 million on marketing alone CNBC reported.

Anheuser-Busch InBev debuted Bud Light Seltzer which immediately took off becoming the third-most-popular seltzer in the US weeks after launching CNN reported citing Nielsen data. And in September 2020 Molson Coors launched Coors Seltzer in four flavors: black cherry grapefruit lemon lime and mango.

And then there were a slew of smaller players that launched between 2018 and 2020: Malibu Splash High Noon Arctic Summer Wild Basin and a dozen more.

By the time the pandemic hit the hard seltzer market was ready. Trapped at home as the virus surged Americans started drinking – a lot. One study published in September 2020 found that drinking in the US was up 14% from the onset of the pandemic with hard seltzer helping to fuel the trend.

Hard seltzer has a promising start to 2021

The hard seltzer category saw $4.5 billion in sales from May 2020 to May 2021 with White Claw and Truly combined making up 75% of the market share according to NielsenIQ data shared with Insider's Mary Meisenzahl.

Bud Light Seltzer remained in third and in February AB InBev said its ""beyond beer"" category which includes seltzer had topped $1 billion The Wall Street Journal reported.

In March rapper Travis Scott partnered with AB InBev to launch Cacti which sold out its inventory in only 12 hours after an ad aired during this year's Grammys. And Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer both owned by Molson Coors started to make gains particularly after the company said it would increase it seltzer production capacity by 400%.

Ahead of the summer analysts and business-owners predicted it was going to be ""a big summer for hard seltzer"" and White Claw launched Surge a new seltzer with 8% alcohol instead of the standard 5%.

Signs of a slow-down emerged halfway through 2021

But by July it seemed that seltzer's popularity was beginning to fade. Boston Beer founder Jim Koch warned in the company's second-quarter earnings that the ""hard seltzer category and overall beer industry were softer than we had anticipated.""

Bloomberg Intelligence data showed that hard seltzer sales had slowed to a crawl during the summer and data from Jefferies and Nielsen found the same: Sales growth slowed to about 30% by July 2021 down from 165% in 2020 Insider's Alex Bitter reported.

Phil Lempert a food analyst and founder of SupermarketGuru.com told Insider at the time that a return to restaurants and bars was the likely culprit with drinks like cocktails seeming like a more interesting option than a hard seltzer.

Even White Claw sales began slumping: White Claw sales dipped 12.8% during the first two weeks of September Wine Business reported citing data from Evercore ISI.

Molson Coors discontinued Coors Seltzer in the US after less than a year on the market

Coors Seltzer met its demise in July after only a few short months on shelves. Molson Coors said at the time that it didn't think seltzer brands that were an offshoot of an existing beer brand performed well according to Beverage Daily and would opt instead to focus on two other seltzer brands in its portfolio: Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer.

""We launched a number of hard seltzers in the US market and got two clear winners in Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer"" Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley told CNBC at the time. ""In order to prioritize focus and put all our investments and efforts behind our two clear winners that led us to the decision.""

Since then Vizzy has become one of the top-four seltzer brands in the US and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer will rollout across the US next year according to Forbes.

Truly's parent company dumps ""millions of cases"" of the hard seltzer

Monica Schipper/Getty Images for NYCWFF



Boston Beer's Koch told CNBC this month that the company overestimated the popularity of hard seltzers getting overly ""aggressive"" about buying raw materials like flavors and cans and adding extra capacity to produce Truly Koch said during an interview on ""Closing Bell.""

""Frankly we overbought"" he said. ""And when the growth stopped we had more of all those things than we were going to be able to use because there is a shelf life.""

Now Boston Beer plans to throw away the excess cases rather than sell them at a discount. Koch told CNBC that the company would rather eat the product than run the risk of selling customers stale Trulys.

But Boston Beer isn't the only company taking a hit when it comes to seltzers: Constellation Brands said in its most recent earnings that it has excess inventory of hard seltzers ""resulting from a slowdown in the overall category in the US.""

The craze has fizzled out but seltzers are here to stay

Bethany Biron/Business Insider



It would be oversimplifying it to say that the hard seltzer category as a whole is on the decline or that the world has moved on from hard seltzer.

But it's safe to say that the craze is over due in large part to how big the category gotten – Brandy Rand an analyst with research firm IWSR told Bloomberg earlier this year that ""the larger the category the harder it is to achieve double and triple-digit growth.""

Plus the bigger players with large distribution networks are likely to edge out the seltzer upstarts still trying to gain a foothold in the market. ""The winners are going to be the ones that have the best distribution"" Lempert of SupermarketGuru.com told Insider in July. ""That's No. 1.""

At this point the brands that will succeed will need to have ""a clear point of difference"" Molson Coors' CEO Hattersley said during the company's most recent earnings call.

""We have been saying for more than a year now that (hard seltzers) couldn't continue to grow at the pace they were at"" he said. ""But they are now a part of the alcohol space and they are here to stay.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

After I went to college I went into the Army for active duty mostly at Fort Jackson at the end of the Korean War. After I finished basic training and learned how to shoot ma- chine guns they had an opening as a bookkeeper at the Fort Jackson Golf Club.

The brokerage firm I decided to go with was Harris Upham. The reason I joined them is the guy who ran the office Ralph Van Landingham Jr. had the best reputation for making money for the customer and not for the brokerage firm. I had to take a little less pay there but I decided to go with the best trainer I could work for.

[Van Landingham] taught me everything that led to my career as an investor. One [tip] was to buy into businesses that have a good long-term path and not to do the hot stock of the week from the brokerage firm. Think about businesses that are durable and will grow. I was able to go with him to visit companies. In those days you could do that. I learned how to ‘kick the tires.’

[Pat Locke and I] met at the time Spirit Square was being resurrected. She was on the city council and I was in these arts organizations. She being on the city council helped me understand how politics work.

I had gone on a trip with the Chamber of Commerce to Baltimore and Philadelphia. We heard about the 1% for art effort they’d done for those two cities. Pat and I discussed how we could get it done in Charlotte. We had to make all kinds of calls to line up the votes to do it.

Golf taught me so much about dealing with hardships and tough times. You’re going to hit some bad golf shots. You’re going to mess up and you have to get over that. A lot of junior players couldn’t handle adversity. They did not understand how to use strategy to win golf matches.

I think it [golf] helped me invest in stocks. In golf you make a mistake there’s no team to blame. If you hit a bad shot it’s on you. If I mess up on a stock recommendation it’s on me not the analyst in New York who told me about it. I decided when I was older I wasn’t going to get any better at golf but I probably would get better at investing.

Harold [Varner] and I met when he was still in high school in Gastonia. I had a guy who caddied for me and he told me ‘Bill there’s a young man in Gastonia who needs some help. He’s qualified to play in the First Tee championship at Pebble Beach.’ I called the PGA in Jacksonville Florida; they have a fund to support young people to go to tournaments. He won the Pro-Am First Tee Open in 2007 with [veteran pro] Morris Hatalsky. Harold made four natural birdies on the back nine on Pebble Beach. It was on TV and I saw it. When he got back I asked him to play as my guest at Quail Hollow.

The key issue about Charlotte is how to handle growth. It includes how to deal with the need for low-cost housing. We also have a big need for homelessness issues: People who are on the streets and can’t survive without help.

I am buying stocks anytime I find a good idea. I call that “taking it out for a date.” You don’t get married unless you go with somebody awhile. And you don’t want to get married to a stock until you really understand it and you can’t learn it all in one day.

More recently I would say that Microsoft has been my best investment. I talked to my people eight years ago and I asked “Why aren’t you looking at Microsoft?” It had a huge number of customers that related to Microsoft the software as well as other products. I felt like those customers if given the opportunity to get a better product would trade up and not jump over to IBM.

Everyone is down on IBM right now. But they still have all these customers. They’ve got new management. You want to be looking at ways to invest in technology not necessarily at technology companies but who will benefit from the technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvZm9ybWVyLXNwYWNleC1lbmdpbmVlcnMtZm91bmRlZC1hLWNvbXBhbnktdG8tYnVpbGQtY2xpbWF0ZS1mcmllbmRseS1jb3N0LWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1wb3J0YWJsZS1udWNsZWFyLXJlYWN0b3JzLTExNjM1NTM2MjUz0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvZm9ybWVyLXNwYWNleC1lbmdpbmVlcnMtZm91bmRlZC1hLWNvbXBhbnktdG8tYnVpbGQtY2xpbWF0ZS1mcmllbmRseS1jb3N0LWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1wb3J0YWJsZS1udWNsZWFyLXJlYWN0b3JzLTExNjM1NTM2MjUz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former SpaceX engineers founded a company to build 'climate-friendly cost-effective' portable nuclear reactors,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/former-spacex-engineers-founded-a-company-to-build-climate-friendly-cost-effective-portable-nuclear-reactors-11635536253 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvZm9ybWVyLXNwYWNleC1lbmdpbmVlcnMtZm91bmRlZC1hLWNvbXBhbnktdG8tYnVpbGQtY2xpbWF0ZS1mcmllbmRseS1jb3N0LWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1wb3J0YWJsZS1udWNsZWFyLXJlYWN0b3JzLTExNjM1NTM2MjUz0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvZm9ybWVyLXNwYWNleC1lbmdpbmVlcnMtZm91bmRlZC1hLWNvbXBhbnktdG8tYnVpbGQtY2xpbWF0ZS1mcmllbmRseS1jb3N0LWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1wb3J0YWJsZS1udWNsZWFyLXJlYWN0b3JzLTExNjM1NTM2MjUz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

That stands for “little brown job.” John doesn’t think much of the different starlings and sparrows and other non-flashy little brown or brownish-grey birds so he doesn’t really bother to count them in his life list. Later Regina gets to drawl back at him that she likes the LBJs as he winces. It’s a good metaphor for this father and daughter who love each other so much it hurts but can’t connect. It’s also a good metaphor for how they approach life.

…Beautifully crafted… lyrical funny and painful play that should be on your must-see list.

But they keep trying. The story takes place over nine years—from when Caitlyn is about 25 to her mid-thirties through a couple of her relationships miscarriages job changes her mother’s illness and John moving into and coming out of retirement and other major life changes. When we first meet them John is a scientist who after over 20 years of hard work is on the third stage of trials for a new drug that could cure a chronic disease. In the wider world the climate crisis has intensified society is splitting into more and more divisive groups and every choice can seem fraught with unforeseen consequences. Change is bringing them together and splitting them apart as the past 18 months have done to so many.

So John (a veteran birder) and Caitlyn (who is a novice) regularly meet at the Baltimore family home and spend time together in the back yard. They try with varying degrees of success to connect to each other. Both are flummoxed as to why it is so difficult to be seen and understoodeven as they become more entrenched in their positions. The seasons pass the birds come and go and John and Caitlyn’s relationship ebbs and wanes.

This play also offers very welcome moments of laugh-out-loud humor Though even the humor that isn’t so much laugh-out-loud and born of sorrow fear and longing offers some hope that it can at least keep even a tiny door open. You feel it viscerally when John leaves a message on his daughter’s voice mail speaking completely from the heart then deletes it and leaves a simple hi hope all is well call-me-when-you-can message. That lost opportunity that Caitlyn has so pined for is heartbreaking. It’s funny in a familiar have-I-revealed-too-much face-palm kind of way.

As John Jackson gives us a man who has been trying to live life as ethically as he can but has turned a little strident in his views and is unyielding. He’s a scientist—rational above all—who values specificity and conscious well-weighed choices. Like many men in the later third of his life his life’s work defines him to a great extent and he’s a little lost when it ends. He reminds us that we have greater responsibilities than our own concerns and that change is inevitable and can be frightening at any age. Uncertainty is not the province of the young. Jackson has a dry dead-pan delivery in much of his dialogue yet you sense the fire underneath. The dialogue between him and Caitlyn when a fledgling falls out of a nest and they debate what to do is both illuminating and insanely funny. It also offers a roadmap on how to reach a mutual understanding for them and the rest of us. It also illuminates how hard it is to make those moments last when one is seeing trees and not the forest.

Aquino’s Caitlyn is young smart knows which of her father’s buttons to push and finding her own path in life. She doesn’t need her father to agree with her every choice but wants him to respect her right to choose. She also craves his protection. When she describes in excruciating detail her last miscarriage and the treatment she endured from a young male doctor she is desperately trying to make him understand her reality as a young woman in the world. The moment isn’t successful. Aquino wisely delves down to find the strength in and genuineness of her character’s path.

Serge Seiden directs “Birds of North America” with a lyrical touch and uses the humor wisely. It’s never jarring or abrasive but modulated as naturally as when two people come near a precipice and take that step away. He is ably assisted especially by lighting designer Brittany Shemuga whose work gracefully illuminates the passing seasons and the aging of the characters. Sound designer David Lamont Wilson gives us aural cues with the sound of wings whooshing by when father and/or daughter have caught sight of a bird and it takes flight—except for an owl. Because of their wing and feather structure owls are silent. When one is spotted the silence is somehow reverent. The set was designed by Alexa Ross with an elegantly dreamy backdrop of color and wings anchored by a picnic table benches lawn chairs and piles of leaves (Deborah Thomas is the properties designer). Throughout the show at scene changes more leaves are brought to the stage and seem to help signify the increasing weight of things said and unsaid and time passing. It’s a thoughtful set.

Brandee Mathies is the costume designer and the clothing choices reflect the characters. John’s clothes barely change—khakis a plaid or plain shirt a jacket or vest—all in earth tones. This is the very wardrobe of a man for whom clothing is simply covering. Caitlyn’s clothes change as she ages from the mid-twenties to mid-thirties becoming more tailored and slightly more authoritative.

“Birds of North America” is a lyrical funny and painful play that should be on your must-see list. It says so much and the 90-minutes fly by. We may all walk away with more respect for the LBJs—the everyday little birds—who by their sheer numbers and anonymity change their little corners of the world without fanfare.

Running Time: 90 minutes without intermission.

Show Advisory: For mature teens and older; straight talk about miscarriages; some adult language.

The historical treasure decorates the main bathhouse at Hisham's Palace a major archaeological site just north of the city of Jericho.

It is more than 1000 years old and has taken five years as well as some $12 million to restore so it can be opened up safely to the public.

Palestinian Tourism Minister Rula Maa’yah said the mosaic is an international treasure both because of its immense size and because it is preserved in its original location.

The size of the mosaic panels is approximately 835 square metres.

They show beautiful floral and geometric designs made up of 21 colours including red blue and ochre.

One part of the ancient floor shows the “tree of life” said Jericho Governor Majed Al-Fityani with a lion preying on a deer on the left side of the tree and two deers living peacefully on the other side.

This image is supposed to symbolise war and peace.

The mosaic depicts the 'tree of life' said Jericho's governor.

The mosaic is believed to be from the Umayyad period which lasted from 660 to 750 AD.

It is disputed whether the Umayyad Caliph Hisham bin Abd al-Malik or his nephew and successor al-Walid II built the Palace.

In 947 AD the mosaic was buried under rubble caused by an earthquake.

The Palace remained forgotten for centuries until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.

In 2016 a Japanese-funded restoration effort was launched. Five years later the ancient artefact was uncovered on Thursday for members of the public and press then recovered until a protective roof is finished next year.

The Palestinian tourism ministry hopes the newly-restored mosaic will become a major attraction in future.

Since the mosaic was excavated in the 1930s and 1940s it was mostly hidden under canvas and soil to protect it against the sun and rain.

Palestinians in the West Bank live under Israeli military occupation with restrictions on their freedom of movement and access to basic amenities.

Often Israeli authorities deny entry for non-registered Palestinians into the West Bank as well as obstructing entry for their non-registered spouses and other family members according to Human Rights Watch.

The unveiling comes just weeks after Israeli authorities demolished parts of a Palestinian cemetery to make way for a “biblical” theme park.

Timber and environmental groups have reached an agreement that sets Oregon on a course to overhaul management of 10 million acres of private forestlands in the state.

The deal announced Saturday by Gov. Kate Brown’s office concludes more than a year of negotiations between often at-odds sides to develop a plan to boost protections for vulnerable fish and wildlife while shielding the timber industry’s ability to log.

Friday was the deadline for both sides to either reach consensus abandon the process or move the deadline. Negotiators worked through the day Friday and wrapped up business shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday. Brown and her staff helped push the negotiations to completion.

“Today’s historic agreement is a perfect example of the Oregon Way –– coming together at the table to find common ground to the mutual benefit of us all” Brown said in a press release. “Together this agreement will help to ensure that Oregon continues to have healthy forests fish and wildlife as well as economic growth for our forest industry and rural communities for generations to come. I would like to thank everyone involved for their role in making this agreement a reality today.”

Jim James with the Oregon Small Woodlands Association similarly praised the compromise.

“We were able to put down the contentious situations that we’ve had in the past and we had a continuous agreement to move forward” James said. “I think that’s an extreme positive for the state of Oregon.”

In 2020 the sides each planned a series of competing ballot measures that could have turned into a costly political fight. Environmental groups sought among other priorities strict limits on spraying of aerial pesticides and improved protection for forest waters. Meanwhile the timber industry sought compensation for private landowners when state regulations limited their ability to log.

Brown instead pushed for the two sides to negotiate and their agreement to do so was hailed as historic even then though it was just a beginning.

Representatives from the timber industry and environmental groups were charged with setting terms to pursue a statewide habitat conservation plan to safeguard fish wildlife and water quality. A habitat conservation plan or HCP is a tool that allows practices like logging or irrigation to continue while minimizing damage to wildlife habitat.

Saturday’s deal sets in motion what could be a lengthy possibly yearslong process to craft approve and adopt an HCP into law and begin implementation.

“There’s no doubt that there’s gonna be challenges ahead” said Sean Stevens executive director of the conservation group Oregon Wild. “But I do think that this agreement provides a different sort of foundation than we’ve ever had before for tackling those challenges ahead.”

The next step will be to introduce a bill in the Oregon Legislature to make significant changes to the Forest Practices Act to protect riverbanks and streamsides improve forest roads and allow for adaptive management of private forests. The state will then pursue an HCP which will require a rulemaking process overseen by the Oregon Board of Forestry (which just approved a new state forester). After that state leaders can pitch the plan to federal regulators.

Speaking on behalf of the timber coalition Adrian Miller with the Florida-based forest products company Rayonier said Saturday’s agreement gives timber operators a sense of security going forward.

“I think we’re all really proud to be part of a new era of forestry in Oregon” Miller said.

‘Flyin’ West’ now showing in-person at Everyman Theatre in Baltimore MD through October 31 2021 and streaming on-demand through November 14 2021 is a magnificent reason to return to live theatre if you already haven’t done so.

…a cast that just owns these roles…Go see this show or stream it.

This is a cast to celebrate: Aakhu TuahNera Freeman as Miss Leah; Eleasha Gamble as Sophie Washington; Bianca Lipford as Minnie Dove Charles; Calvin McCullough as Frank Charles (Minnie’s husband); Briana Gibson Reeves as Fannie Dove; and Jefferson A. Russell as Wil Parson.

Written by Pearl Cleage “Flyin’ West” takes us to Nicodemus a town on the northwest Kansas plains. It was founded by newly freed slaves in 1877 as a refuge from the Reconstruction-era South and a reflection of the mass Black migration from the South to the Midwest after the Civil War. Nicodemus was both the first Black community west of the Mississippi River and is the only predominantly Black community west of the Mississippi that remains a living community (albeit a small one) today. As this play shows even there white folk wanted to either run the Black community out or take over the work they’d put in and run them off.

This play also reveals in heartbreaking detail it wasn’t just white people that hated and feared Black people. Frank Charles is as he says a mulatto and the illegitimate son of a white slave owner who has white half-brothers. He is inordinately proud of that and it leads to sorrow. McCullough has a hard role to play. His rejection of anything Black makes him suspect in the eyes of Black people and means nothing to white people. He imbues this role with an undercurrent of fear and self-loathing that earns him some empathy from the audience even as his actions and words are repulsive. McCullough manages to find the shades of grey in this character.

It is also a very funny play. Freeman as Miss Leah has a way with comedy. One of the funniest moments comes when she starts putting together an apple pie—and that’s as far as I can say without a spoiler. Given what that pie will be used for her absolute delight in knowing this particular recipe is priceless. Like all of the women hers is a strong character.

Cleage creates her characters with different strengths. These women and men have survived slavery and the aftermath and then simply gathered what they could and walked westward toward a place they thought of as their promised land. Then after putting in the work and building houses and plowing and planting land white speculators began to arrive and try to low-ball the Black settlers into selling. Sophie has become a leader in the community. She’s no-nonsense tough and has a dream of the kind of security and haven Nicodemus could be. Fannie is more the romantic. She and Wil are slowly (very slowly) courting and as a former slave she holds the concept of marriage in reverence. When Minnie and Frank come back to Minnie’s home to visit her sisters and Miss Leah she is horrified at the cracks she can see in the marriage—and sees it as Minnie’s responsibility to submit to her husband even as he’s physically abusive.

Now that she is 21 Minnie is to be given a deed for one-third of the land that the three women had claimed and nurtured. That is the only reason that Frank had agreed to the trip (they were living in London where he was a poet).

But it’s Miss Leah who will come up with a plan to resolve the problem that Frank has brought home. Fannie comes to understand how a woman who saw her ten babies sold off and still survived came to make the hard choices not out of fear but hope and love. We watch Minnie the youngest imbibe that lesson also and learn what home and family mean.

Cleage covers a lot of ground in this story of a few days in the life of one family—blood and otherwise—and she does so with a sure touch and a storyteller’s born instinct on how to keep the audience yearning to know what happens next. This cast—Gamble Freeman Lipford McCullough Reeves and Russell—take the words and the deeper meanings and bring them to full satisfying life with words gestures movement.

The set is designed by Andrew Cohen and evokes the stability that these people earned through their labor and made their own. Costume designer David Burdick has captured each character in the clothes they wear—from Sophie’s no-nonsense canvas coat to Minnie’s au courant hat and Fannie’s softer silhouette. The lighting by Harold F. Burgess II sets the mood for each scene and manages to evoke the wide skies—day or night—of the Kansas prairie. There’s a very open feel even if most of the action takes place in the cabin and the dooryard. The fights and intimacy scenes were overseen by Lewis Shaw and they ring with truth.

Director Paige Hernandez has created a beautiful moment in time that people may not be aware of or have forgotten. She helps bring the words and the feelings to life in a way that grabs the audience’s attention and holds it gently throughout the show.

“Flyin’ West” is a story that celebrates above all survival in the face of horror. And not just survival but growth love laughter dreams generosity honor and strength. With a cast that just owns these roles it’s both a story and message that I think we all need to see and hear right now. Go see this show or stream it.

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

FTSE Russell is considering large-scale changes to the index underpinning a widely used China futures contract in Singapore including potentially doubling the benchmark’s constituents after Hong Kong’s stock exchange broke its rival’s monopoly on the highly popular trade.

Arne Staal chief executive of FTSE Russell said the company may tweak its FTSE China A50 index — a critical tool for international traders seeking to hedge their exposure to Chinese shares — in response to investor feedback.

Traded volumes on the Singapore Exchange’s A50 index futures have risen 20 per cent year on year to 9.3m contracts according to FTSE Russell and SGX.

Recent disruptions to China’s economy from coal shortages and a liquidity crunch for property developers have compounded volatility in Chinese stocks underscoring the growing need for hedging tools among global investors who have poured tens of billions of dollars into the country’s equity markets this year.

The FTSE Russell index offers coverage of the 50 largest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen including Kweichow Moutai the world’s most valuable liquor group and Ping An Insurance China’s biggest private insurer.

Staal said consultation with investors had recently ended and that changes under consideration included broadening the index by potentially expanding it to 100 companies.

Investors were also asked whether they were comfortable with the index’s market capitalisation-based approach to weighting stocks and which channels they preferred to use for accessing companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

“Markets change economies change and indices need to be updated to reflect the transparency of the investment opportunity that investors are looking for today” Staal said adding he wanted the index to remain as “relevant as possible”.

The potential changes to the index which serves as the basis for SGX’s popular futures contract come after the Hong Kong stock exchange broke the Singaporean bourse’s monopoly by launching its own product for mainland Chinese shares last month.

HKEX also snatched a crucial derivatives licensing agreement held by SGX for more than two decades in May last year allowing it to offer futures and options contracts based on 37 of index provider MSCI’s equities indices mostly in Asia.

Staal said the composition of the MSCI China A50 Connect index upon which the Hong Kong exchange-traded futures contracts were based offered “very different exposure than ours”.

Boon-Chye Loh chief executive of SGX added that FTSE China A50 futures were a “hyper liquid” contract that would remain vital for international investors as China’s market continued to open up.

SGX and FTSE Russell had secured more than 90 per cent of SGX’s index futures trading volumes from migrating to HKEX with the new MSCI products they said.

Even so SGX’s derivatives business has taken a hit in the past year. Derivatives revenue for its equities business declined 20 per cent to S$288.4m (US$213m) during the 12 months to the end of June.

SGX’s share price has plunged almost 20 per cent since its August results when it revealed net profit had fallen 7 per cent to S$447m. Shares are up about 7 per cent this year while HKEX’s stock price has risen 12 per cent over the same period.

Michael Wu senior equity analyst at Morningstar said adjustments to the FTSE index “would help with better alignment and overall reflection of the Chinese economy”.

“There are concerns about the substitution or replacement of SGX [by HKEX] . . . but they do have the ecosystem effect” he added referring to the deep liquidity of the China A50 futures market and strong demand from existing investors. “SGX has been very innovative on derivatives generally.”

Others were less sanguine about the Singapore exchange’s prospects. Analysts at Citi said they expected a limited boost to earnings at HKEX from the new futures in the near term as trading volumes would take time to match those of the SGX contract. But they added that “longer term HKEX looks better positioned than SGX in [Chinese onshore equity] derivatives”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzA1MDNkODk4LTc5ZGEtNGQ1NC05ODgwLWQ2ZTRjMGNkMWUyYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Buy the haystack' approach still hard to beat,"Print this page

Vanguard founder Jack Bogle may have recommended that we “buy the haystack” by holding a passive fund tracking a major stock market index. But some investors in exchange traded funds prefer a more targeted approach.

And smart beta — which involves tracking indices built around a metric other than a company’s market capitalisation — can offer them a variety of options. From ETFs that buy companies with high dividend yields to those targeting a specific investment factor such as value or quality there are many ways to seek an edge.

However as with any focused investment approach smart beta can be found wanting in the wrong market conditions. Yield-oriented funds such as the iShares UK Dividend UCITS ETF (IUKD) have flourished this year but only after a painful 2020. Smart beta approaches that give equal weighting to every stock meanwhile have at times struggled in markets commonly dominated by outperforming large-cap stocks.

Similarly unpredictable outcomes have been generated by factor-based ETFs. The fierce recovery in cyclical stocks that took hold from November last year has seen value funds — focused on stocks that are cheap relative to their fundamental value — surge ahead of their rivals.

In the 11 months since the Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough of November 2020 the iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor UCITS ETF (IUVF) has posted a total return of 25 per cent in sterling putting it five percentage points ahead of an MSCI USA ETF (CU1) offered by the same provider. It is also ahead of funds from the same product range that focus on quality and momentum factors. But at other times the value fund has often underperformed.

Further shortcomings have also emerged. The iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor UCITS ETF (IUMF) which buys shares with an upwards price trend only rebalances its portfolio every six months. This meant that it missed part of the cyclical rally before belatedly increasing its value exposure in mid-2021.

If individual funds have these shortcomings is it instead worth mixing and matching? Investors with an enthusiasm for factor investing could attempt to capture a variety of investment styles in a portfolio — something offered by a handful of multi-factor funds. Several options exist: while the iShares funds mentioned have a multi-factor equivalent JPMorgan and others also offer such products.

Hector McNeil co-chief executive of ETF provider HANetf argues that multi-factor products can have a place in portfolios especially when different investment styles are fighting for dominance. He says: “Ideally you’d choose a lowly correlated subset that should help during regime changes (when unloved investment styles or parts of the market come into favour and previously dominant parts lag) which are notoriously difficult to predict.”

Briegel Leitao associate analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar the data provider adds that such funds can “potentially extend and be more consistent in their outperformance when one factor picks up the performance of another factor that has perhaps gone out of style”.

Recent performance of the iShares fund range partly bears this out (see chart). Looking at sterling total returns in the six months from early November 2020 the US value ETF led the pack with an 18.8 per cent return. The US multi-factor fund delivered a return of 5.4 per cent but outpaced the quality and momentum funds from the same range also beating a conventional MSCI USA ETF.

A similar pattern can be seen from November 2020 to October 2021: the multi-factor fund comes out slightly ahead of its quality and momentum-oriented peers but it lags both the MSCI USA ETF and the value fund.

Most of the funds in this product range lack a sufficiently long record for meaningful comparison though — and history has been unkind to multi-factor funds in other respects. McNeil says they have largely failed to capture the attention of investors perhaps because they would rather make their own investment style decisions. Tellingly the iShares US multi-factor fund is much smaller in value than the single-factor offerings in the same range.

Some factors tend to work against each other with one’s losses offsetting another’s gains

There is also a risk of over-diversification. Matt Brennan head of investment management at AJ Bell a UK investment platform says some factors can work against each other with losses from one offsetting gains from another. Value stocks can do less well if a momentum strategy is performing strongly for example. “You end up paying a higher fee but the factors often offset each other” he warns.

More generally Brennan remains sceptical about the rationale for following some factors and says you should only invest if there are sound reasons for outperformance. His choice would be standard ETFs for a broad market exposure with sector or single-factor funds to add a “tilt”.

Does that mean you should rush to open a brokerage account? Maybe eventually. But if you ask personal finance expert and entrepreneur Ramit Sethi he'll tell you there are other accounts worth saving and investing in before you open a brokerage account. Here's his saving and investing hierarchy that he thinks is smart to follow.

1. Contribute to a 401(k) plan to get your employer match

Not everyone has access to a 401(k) plan through their job. But if you have a 401(k) which is a dedicated retirement savings plan and your employer matches contributions it pays to put in enough money to claim that full match.

There's no such thing as a standard match; each company decides that individually. Right now workers are able to contribute up to $19500 a year to a 401(k) if they're under age 50 or up to $26000 if they're 50 or older.

Companies generally won't match those limits -- not even close. But if your employer is willing to match contributions of up to $3000 for example then it's worthwhile to put in that much money so you can claim that free cash for your retirement.

2. Contribute to a Roth IRA

The great thing about Roth IRAs is that you never have to pay taxes on investment gains in your account and withdrawals during retirement can be taken tax-free. This year the annual contribution limit for a Roth IRA is $6000 if you're under 50 and $7000 if you're 50 or older. Because Roth IRAs are self-funded you won't be eligible for a company match like you would with a 401(k).

3. Max out your 401(k)

Workers who earn an average salary generally can't max out a 401(k). But if you've already maxed out a Roth IRA and have more money to save and invest then it pays to put your excess cash into a 401(k). Traditional 401(k) contributions get to go in tax-free and the more money you put in the less income the IRS will tax you on.

Roth IRAs don't happen to offer this benefit so you won't lower your taxes immediately by funding one. But since they offer the advantage of tax-free investment gains and withdrawals during retirement they make a lot of sense -- especially for people who think they'll be in a higher tax bracket during retirement than they're in today.

4. Max out your health savings account

Not everyone is eligible to contribute to a health savings account (HSA). To qualify you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health insurance plan. This year that's defined as a plan with a deductible of $1400 or more for self-only coverage or $2800 or more for family coverage.

HSAs actually offer all of the benefits of both a traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA. HSA contributions go in tax-free and then money that's not being used for immediate healthcare expenses can be invested for added growth. Investment gains in HSAs aren't taxed and neither are withdrawals as long as they're used to cover the cost of qualified medical expenses.

HSA funds never expire so you can save money during your working years to pay for healthcare costs in retirement. And in doing so you get a chance to invest your money in a tax-advantaged fashion.

This year the annual contribution limit for HSAs is $3600 for self-only coverage and $7200 for family coverage if you're under age 55. If you're 55 or older these limits rise to $4600 and $8200 respectively.

5. Invest in a traditional brokerage account

Once you've maxed out the above accounts you should consider investing any additional money you have in a regular brokerage account. Traditional brokerage accounts don't offer tax breaks which is why it pays to first max out those accounts that do come with tax benefits.

But brokerage accounts are also less restrictive. With a 401(k) you can't typically take a withdrawal before age 59½ without facing a penalty. Roth IRAs are a little more flexible but there are rules you have to follow if you want your money before age 59½. HSAs penalize you for taking withdrawals for non-medical reasons. When you invest in a brokerage account you can access your money whenever you want without a penalty.

Should you follow Sethi's plan?

Ramit Sethi knows a lot about saving and investing and so it's not a bad idea to take his advice to heart. At the same time it's okay to map out your own savings and investing plan based on your specific needs and goals. The key is to read up on the different places you can invest your money to make sure you're making choices that will benefit you in the long run.

Have you been caught in the “Squid Game” craze? Or maybe you’re feeling the “love” from Netflix’s “You.” Netflix’s current “Top 10 in the US” has a lot to offer right now.

I will be ranking these Top 10 from lowest to highest in order of quality. I’ll also list their current position on the Netflix Top 10 List but there are some shows and movies on here that you definitely should check out before the others. There’s good TV there’s bad TV and then there’s just plain “why does this even still exist” TV. Netflix’s current “most popular” run the gamut between all of these.

Cocomelon

Being a parent is hard. I swear this show is trending every week and I don’t understand why. But then I remember that people have children and that parents want a break. They want five minutes to wash Cheerios spit-up and other innocuous fluids off their hands.

It’s rather hard to describe “Cocomelon.” There’s really no plot or characters for me to describe. It’s pretty much just hours upon hours of nursery rhymes or other kinds of kid’s music set to vibrant visuals. There’s really nothing here for adult viewers. Unless you’re feeling a little “buzzed” — it might be funny then.

Ranking: Number 9 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 2/10 — Skip unless you are 5 years old.

Locke and Key

Creepy houses blood murder and demons — what’s not to like? “Locke and Key” based on the comic series of the same name certainly won’t be winning any awards for originality or wrack-up statues come awards season but it’s a decent show to binge. It follows Nina Locke who moves her three children into a house in New England following the murder of her husband. Already you can probably tell there are some issues here — traumatized families in a spooky misty England never fare well. It’s all very Lovecraftian.

Ranking: Number 8 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 6/10 — Three cheers for trauma.

Maid

Netflix does serious dramas! And this one is not for the faint of heart. Based on a memoir “Maid” is a miniseries that follows the story of a woman named Alex who leaves her abusive boyfriend and finds a job as a maid. Life of course does not immediately go back to normal following her relationship and there’s more to deal with at her new job. You’ll be feeling heavy after this one.

Ranking: Number 5 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 7.5/10 — Save this for after finals are done too much stress at the moment.

Hypnotic

Netflix sure does love pumping out original movies every week or so. But hey the more they give us the more we have to pick from and if it gives more directors and writers film opportunities I’m not going to complain. “Hypnotic” is a thriller movie released just this weekend starring Kate Siegel and Jason O’Hara. It very aptly involves a hypnotist and his various unethical shenanigans.

Ranking: Number 4 Ranking Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 8/10 — Very seasonally appropriate.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword

It’s always interesting to see when a movie has a resurgence in popularity years after its release. “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” which came out in 2017 is a very typical Guy Ritchie movie full of action crazy stunt sequences and some shaky camera sequences. It didn’t do well critically or financially and to my knowledge faded away in a sea of Arthurian adaptations. But it’s trending on Netflix now — perhaps Charlie Hunnam’s handsome grizzled face has a hand in that.

Ranking: Number 7 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 8.5/10 — As a Medieval and Renaissance Studies student I can never say no to King Arthur.

Army of Thieves

Zack Snyder has made his full departure from Warner Bros. and is taking full advantage of his deal with Netflix. His latest film “Army of the Dead” came out this summer to mixed reception from critics and audiences but Netflix must have been satisfied with its performance because they’re giving this universe spinoff after spinoff. This week Snyder has taken the role of producer with “Army of Thieves.”

“Army of Thieves” is a heist film that serves as a prequel to “Army of the Dead.” You don’t run into heist films all too often but it seems that this one has gained a bit of popularity. It’s definitely not a bad movie to watch with a bowl of popcorn and friends — something chill for a Friday night.

Ranking: Number 2 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 9/10 — Just to see Nathalie Emmanuel’s stunning and stylish hairstyles.

Colin in Black and White

Colin Kaepernick has been through a lot so he deserves a TV show at the very least. Kaepernick is a former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers who is known for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality. This new Netflix series is a dramatic retelling of Colin Kaepernick’s childhood through his high school years and his encounters with race class and culture that inspired his activism. Kaepernick narrates parts of the series himself. I very much hope he’s getting paid well.

Ranking: Number 10 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 10/10 — If you’re looking for something good and serious tackle this.

You

As a society we seem to have an unhealthy obsession with serial killers. Seriously why do we like them so much? I’m no one to judge I’m a Hannibal fan first and the Culture Editor second but it’s still interesting to see how much stock we put in these very dangerous people.

“You” is Netflix’s serial killer cash cow. Based on the book series of the same name we have now followed Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) your friendly local serial killer who falls obsessively in love with every attractive woman that passes him.

Season 3 which was released a couple of weeks ago follows Joe and his wife Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti) as they settle in the suburbs with their newborn son. Serial killers and domesticity? It’s more entertaining than you’d think.

Ranking: Number 1 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 15/10 — Came for the intrigue staying for marital disputes.

Maya and the Three

We need indigenous representation in every medium we can get and that includes animation. “Maya and the Three” is Netflix’s new hot miniseries set in a fantastical “Mesoamerican” world with the warrior princess “Maya.” Not only does the show fully embrace Mesoamerican culture but many of the characters’ voice actors are Latinx as well. I’ve got no complaints here.

Ranking: Number 6 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 25/10 — Zoe Saldana steals the show and my heart.

Squid Game

If you’ve had any sort of internet connection for the past month or so I do not need to tell you to watch this. It’s so good and it’s about time that we see some international shows gain more widespread recognition in the U.S.

“Squid Game” takes place in South Korea where various citizens find themselves drawn into a deadly “Battle Royale”-like game show and play various children’s games to win a multi-million dollar jackpot. Sounds innocent enough but losing one of these games comes with quite literally permanent consequences. These players all also happen to be in some serious debt and there is really no one more desperate on earth than a man in need of quick money.

Ranking: Number 3 on Netflix’s “Top 10 in the US Today”

Rating: 1000/10 — Gong Yoo please slap me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMS8xMC9tYWlkLW5ldGZsaXgtcGFyZW50aW5nLW1vdGhlcmhvb2QtcG92ZXJ0eS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maid on Netflix: The hit series is unflinching except for about one thing.,"The Netflix hit Maid which after only a few weeks has already vaulted into the service’s all-time Top 10 seems to have come exactly when it’s needed. Inspired by Stephanie Land’s memoir Maid: Hard Work Low Pay and a Mother’s Will to Survive the 10-episode series is striking a chord so often left unstruck a deeply moving exploration of domestic and emotional abuse generational trauma and the infuriating catch-22s of government systems built for failure. Its raw unflinching depictions could have pushed viewers away but the response tells a different story. Countless women see themselves in Alex (Margaret Qualley) her struggles to first define and then prove the emotional abuse from her boyfriend and the so-big-you-could-drive-a-truck-through-them holes in any safety net. As the pandemic continues to expose the spit-and-glue foundation of many societal systems particularly for mothers Maid is a tough but ultimately inspirational tale of a woman’s ability to not only navigate those systems but ultimately triumph over them.

As a mother Alex is almost blindingly perfect with unlimited patience that borders on magical.

The brutal clarity with which Maid depicts the realities of poverty and abuse however falters when it comes to Alex’s parenting skills. Alex is as she should be a complicated individual one who’s allowed a degree of ambiguity in nearly all of her relationships. It’s enraging and heartbreaking purposefully so to watch her return to her abusive boyfriend after working so hard to escape him. It’s devastating to watch her ping-pong between being caretaker to and dependent on her own mother Paula (Qualley’s real-life mother Andie MacDowell) who struggles with undiagnosed bipolar disorder and the lingering effects of the abuse Alex’s own father inflected on them both. But as a mother Alex is almost blindingly perfect with unlimited patience that borders on magical. She never loses her temper reacts with frustration or really does anything one would expect a parent of a toddler to do—especially one facing such incredible uphill battles.

Instead Alex is presented as a mother who can flawlessly shepherd toddlers and infants alike a rugged Maria von Trapp with skills unparalleled not only by any other mother in the show but any mother in real life. Alex is able to seamlessly transfer a sleeping infant from car seat to crib; Alex can pull her toddler away from cartoons on her tablet without even a whimper of protest. (Watching the series with a sleeping 3-month-old on my lap and a 3-year-old glued to her own tablet I almost laughed out loud.) Alex is tired and frustrated and overwhelmed at her circumstances but she is never tired and frustrated and overwhelmed with her child. The only hint of a raised voice comes in the first episode when fleeing her abusive boyfriend a second time dealing with a boss who will not stop calling and fielding irrational demands from a child who’s pestering her about a lost doll Alex’s voice pinches in anger and vague annoyance flashes on her face. But that brief moment of peevishness ultimately only serves to underline Alex’s perfection. The episode ends with an act of wholesome motherly compassion: Alex stopping at a dollar store to replace the lost doll.

In the world of Maid questionable mothering is reserved for other characters: Paula swinging wildly between love for her daughter and her own spirit and needs; rich and nasty Regina (Anika Noni Rose) who after separating from her husband isn’t sure she wants the newborn she thought she’d desired; even the one-scene character in Alex’s writing group who sheepishly admits that asked to write about one of her happiest moments describes a girls’ night out and not a day with her children. That throwaway line speaks volumes not only about America’s expectation that women who become mothers should derive their joy primarily from caregiving but also the show’s.

Advertisement

The message echoes even through Netflix’s marketing for Maid. “A mom will endure even the most difficult humbling experiences to provide better for her child” reads one ad and the trailer builds to Alex’s declaration “I live for my daughter.” Alex continuously voices and acts on the idea that she wants a better life for Maddy (Rylea Nevaeh Whittet)  but rarely mentions wanting a better life for herself. Even when she fantasizes about a near future in which she’ll attend college and learn to be a writer it’s to create a “whole new world” for her daughter. In the place she’s back-breakingly created it’s not even clear how much Alex is present.

Much has been written in the last year about how the pandemic has irrevocably changed motherhood and much has been written about how it disproportionately affects low-income people but the overlap in that Venn diagram hasn’t really been investigated. Maid misses a vital opportunity to explore the raging anger of mothers who have had systems that were already stacked against them break down and the bleak truth over which mothers are allowed to make mistakes. On a recent Grey’s Anatomy episode two mothers confess to each other the way COVID has exposed the drudgery and darkness that is day-in/day-out parenting. But financially stable surgeons can falter in their mothering while mistakes are often devastating for single mothers low-income mothers and mothers of color—both on and off screen. Maid scratches the surface of these inequities but it misses a crucial chance to explore the cruel systemic ways low-income mothers face an increased risk of having their children removed from their custody by agents whose job is ostensibly to protect the family.

It’s exciting to see a show like Maid succeed especially since its success comes on the heels of last year’s record-setting The Queen’s Gambit both of them shows centering on complex and complicated women that likely would not have gotten a green light even a few years ago. Unfortunately Maid’s portrayal of Alex’s perfection as a mom doesn’t show this progress. At a time when women’s discontent has gone from “the problem that has no name” to a primal scream Maid fails to show a place in between one where mothers are given a voice without having to be perfect.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9uZXRmbGl4LXJlbGVhc2VkLWEtaG9ycm9yLW1vdmllLXdyaXR0ZW4tYnktYS1ib3QtYW5kLWl0cy1zcGVjdGFjdWxhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix released a horror movie written by a bot and it's spectacular,"Earlier this month Netflix released a horror movie written exclusively by bots. Now that it's Halloween it's time to share that video.

It's terrible. Hilariously terrible. Terrible in all the ways you hoped it might be terrible. You can watch it below.

Netflix worked with Keaton Patti who's done this bot thing before. This time round the bot watched over 400000 hours of horror movies before penning its great masterpiece 'Mr. Puzzles Wants You to Be Less Alive'.

'Mr. Puzzles Wants You to Be Less Alive' focuses on Mr Puzzles clearly based on a misunderstanding of the movie Saw. He's a bad guy attempting to kill people via elaborate set-ups that make no sense. There are a lot of Saw movies so it's possible the bot spent 400000 hours watching nothing but Saw movies.

""Do you want to be a gamer"" Mr Puzzles asks.

""Do not kill me please"" says one victim ""I have several families.""

He said the crop rotation system was one of the effective methods of maintaining soil fertility that could enhance productivity and crop yield.

Mr Dawuni was speaking at a day’s workshop at Gushegu in the Northern Region on educating farmers on the causes of climate change and its effects on agriculture.

The workshop was organised by Suglo Konbo a civil society organisation and funded by the European Union with technical support from Urbanet ActionAid and Tree Aid.

The training was to equip participants with the knowledge to build resilience against climate change and its related effects on agricultural production.

It was further to empower participants with knowledge and information on agricultural programmes and opportunities for farmers to take advantage to enhance women’s participation in sustainable agriculture.

It was attended by 60 women farmers drawn from Kpatili Nyensung Gbambu Laligu and Kpana Yapalsi farming communities in the Gushegu Municipality.

Mr Dawuni encouraged them to desist from engaging in indiscriminate felling of trees saying such an act had devastating effects on the environment.

Mr Nassam Abdul Razak Assistant Director at the Gushegu Municipal Assembly called on traditional authorities to enact by-laws to prohibit the rampant felling of trees in the Municipality.

Mr Kojo Inusah Management Information System Officer at the Ministry of Food and Agriculture who facilitated the workshop took participants through understanding climate and climate change causes of climate change sectors affected by climate change among other topics.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The increasing focus on environmental social and governance (“ESG”) considerations at public companies including this year’s highly publicized proxy contest at Exxon Mobil Corporation (“Exxon”) has demonstrated the growing importance of understanding ESG and the implications it can have for investors and companies. Among the many ESG developments bubbling to the forefront of the markets in recent years is the desire of investors to see companies address social justice concerns. In particular shareholders have begun to request that companies conduct racial equity audits (“Racial Equity Audits”) which generally seek an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. We anticipate greater interest in Racial Equity Audits and similar initiatives in the upcoming proxy season and accordingly believe companies will be pushed to critically and objectively examine their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion to identify areas in need of improvement.

A. Overview of the ESG Landscape Today

ESG considerations can be broken down into three categories. First—environmental criteria which considers a company’s actions as a steward of the environment such as what steps a company is taking to address the depletion of the planet’s resources pollution and greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of climate change. Second—social criteria which considers how a company engages with all of its stakeholders (including employees customers and suppliers) rather than just shareholders including the treatment and diversity of its employees on the frontline management and boardroom levels the effects of a company on the surrounding community and whether a company is working with suppliers who share similar socially desirable values. Third—corporate governance which considers how a company governs itself and holds itself accountable taking into account the structure and diversity of a company’s board of directors the separation between management and the board of directors executive compensation equal and fair pay amongst employees and the extent to which a company or its management or board of directors are undertaking lobbying efforts making political and charitable donations or engaging in corruption or bribery.

With the increasing prominence of ESG awareness the market has also seen the rise of ESG-specific funds as a new form of investment vehicle. These funds have explicit mandates to make ESG-focused investments from mutual funds whose portfolio companies must score a high grade on ESG metrics to investment firms dedicated to ESG impact investing. In the U.S. market there are now over 600 ESG funds and exchange-traded funds for investors to choose from with approximately $161 billion in assets under management (“AUM”) which is more than double the AUM of ESG funds in 2010. According to research from Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) “ESG Funds were among the largest winners in 2020 taking in a record $60 billion in net flows nearly triple their 2019 total.”

In the meantime on November 9 2020 the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced the issuance of new final rules that expanded human capital management disclosure requirements applicable to SEC reporting companies. Since then SEC leadership has signaled that more comprehensive ESG-related disclosure could be mandated in the near future with SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee issuing statements earlier this year “directing the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings” and inviting input from “investors registrants and other market participants on climate change disclosure.” Former Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance John Coates also stated earlier in the year that the “SEC should help lead the creation of an effective ESG disclosure system so companies can provide investors with information they need in a cost-effective manner.” Based on these statements we believe there is a strong likelihood that the current SEC-mandated human capital management disclosures will soon be expanded to require additional disclosures covering environmental and other social initiatives and metrics further supporting a view that ESG awareness stewardship and reporting at public companies are here to stay.

As the ESG movement gains momentum and as the new wave of investors who factor ESG concerns into their investment decisions gain a larger share of the market companies are being advised to revisit their current policies and practices under the ESG lens. Companies that dismiss these concerns or lag behind their peers in addressing ESG matters may find themselves in the crosshairs of investors and proxy advisory firms or even state legislatures and federal agencies. On the other hand it has been found that companies that affirmatively adopt meaningful approaches to these issues may not only help progress environmental and societal goals but may also potentially see improved financial performance.

B. How ESG Ties Into Shareholder Activism

ESG considerations are becoming increasingly relevant to shareholder activists. This is because issues relating to climate change and the environment racial justice and diversity human capital and governance may influence companies at large and shareholder investment flows. Governance has long been a key focus of shareholder activists as corporate governance best practices including accountability of a company’s board of directors to its shareholders robust disclosure on executive compensation and independence of a board of directors from management have been found to have a readily apparent correlation with increased returns to shareholders. Recently however activists have begun to realize that social and environmental issues can also impact their investments in both negative and positive ways.

ISS and others have published a number of reports that have found that addressing social and environmental concerns correlates with companies either currently experiencing or having the potential to experience increased growth and profitability. As discussed in more detail below a company’s performance on ESG factors such as investment into renewable energy promotion of employee health and safety and contributions to the local community are pressing issues that can either benefit or adversely affect a company’s perception in the public eye operational execution and bottom line. Enhanced performance in these areas can lead to less scrutiny from environmental regulators increased customer loyalty more productive employees reduced employee turnover more lucrative business partnerships and increased profitability.

Improved ESG criteria is not a new area for activist investors. Shareholder activists have advocated for increased diversity in corporate boardrooms for a number of years. Concurrently with shareholder activists nominating an increasing number of diverse director candidates the voting policies of many institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc. (“BlackRock”) have been updated to reflect a desire to enhance boardroom diversity as have the voting guidelines of many prominent proxy advisory firms such as ISS. State governments have also codified ESG initiatives into law—California leading the charge with the passage of Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 which require a certain percentage of directors on the boards of public companies headquartered in the state be composed of females and individuals from underrepresented communities. Most shareholder activists are cognizant of the stance of institutional investors and proxy advisory firms on ESG issues and have increasingly incorporated ESG factors into their proxy campaigns.

C. Recent Push for Racial Equity Audits

Amongst the various ESG developments gaining traction in the markets is the recent push by shareholders for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits which generally consist of an objective investigation into a company’s practices policies and histories to determine such company’s impact on social issues and areas for improvement. In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020 and the subsequent civil rights movement and unrest many companies announced a number of initiatives and measures to address social justice issues including committing financial resources and reviewing their own policies and practices. However many advocates believe that without objective means to identify areas of improvement and monitor companies’ progress these commitments may be illusory and confirmation that these companies have in fact met their commitments could be difficult. Accordingly the 2021 proxy season saw an influx of shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (“Rule 14a-8”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits.

Just like its environmental and corporate governance counterparts addressing social concerns can be equally important to companies and investors alike as this can translate into among other things value additive results. For example following a racially-tinged incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks in 2018 where two African-American men who were waiting for a business meeting to begin were arrested the company performed a Racial Equity Audit which found that among other things racial sensitivity and the elimination of implicit biases are correlated to Starbuck’s core business plan of “creating an inclusive and equitable working environment as well as a welcoming ‘third place’ between home and work for customers.” In addition the W.K. Kellogg Foundation has found that “[b]y 2050 our country stands to realize an $8 trillion gain in GDP by closing the U.S. racial equity gap.”

II: Background and Overview

A. What Are Racial Equity Audits?

A Racial Equity Audit is at its core an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. Not only are Racial Equity Audits designed to help inform investors about their current and future investments from a social and financial perspective but are also intended to help companies craft their policies and practices to achieve their social justice goals.

According to certain proponents the point of a Racial Equity Audit is not necessarily to critique a company’s current platforms and efforts. Rather as argued by Trillium Asset Management (“Trillium”) a strong proponent of such audits the point of an audit is to embrace the notion that “if management is truly committed to make racial justice a critical element of its operations then in practice it can and should treat it like any other operations issue and audit it as such.” These proponents further argue that Racial Equity Audits should not be viewed as the end of a process for companies and/or shareholders looking to make a change; instead they can be a “stepping stone” to assist companies in developing and identifying a strategic plan to advance their goals.

B. What Impact Can a Racial Equity Audit Have on a Company’s Social Equity Policies and Practices?

The impact a Racial Equity Audit may have on a company may be felt in many ways. Racial Equity Audits can focus on various aspects of a company’s business including the treatment of customers at a company’s physical locations the diversity of senior management the targeting of products and even political contributions. Following an audit some companies have used the findings to develop a strategic plan to capitalize on opportunities to address racial equity moving forward. For example following the voluntary Racial Equity Audit conducted by Starbucks after the 2018 incident discussed above the company began requiring implicit bias training for employees setting public corporate diversity goals and implementing a number of other social initiatives. The public announcement of the Racial Equity Audit and related diversity equity and inclusion efforts appeared to not only rehabilitate Starbucks’ public image after the incident but helped the company become the “most popular restaurant stock on the S&P 500 with actively managed funds that are dedicated to ESG investing” according to RBC Capital Markets.

Racial Equity Audits may also find that a company’s existing policies and practices are not sufficient to address or may be perpetuating systemic social issues. For example in the supporting statement submitted by the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) to its Racial Equity Audit proposal included in the proxy statement for The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (“Goldman”) 2021 annual meeting of shareholders SEIU detailed Goldman’s alleged contributions to systemic racism. Specifically SEIU stated that “Goldman underwrites municipal bonds whose proceeds pay police brutality settlements.” Similarly Trillium on behalf of Christopher and Anne Ellinger submitted a Racial Equity Audit proposal that was included in Johnson & Johnson’s proxy statement for its 2021 annual meeting of shareholders in which Trillium expressed concerns with claims that the company continues to market its talc-based baby powder to “Black and Brown women after its talc supplier included the WHO’s ‘possibly carcinogenic’ label on shipments.” Proponents of Racial Equity Audits argue that a reassessment of internal policies and practices via such audits can identify the right levers to pull to begin to shrink these racial divides.

C. What Is the Democracy Case For Racial Equity Audits?

Civil rights advocates and proponents of social justice have long touted the moral and ethical considerations of closing the racial divide in America. Recently investors and companies have also begun to appreciate that positive financial returns are often associated with investing in initiatives working towards racial equality. Beyond the moral case and business case for conducting Racial Equity Audits and fighting systemic racism in general is the “democracy case” espoused by social justice advocates and that corporations can at times act more swiftly and have a more profound effect on current social issues than the government; therefore these advocates argue that corporations have a responsibility to address issues affecting our democracy. Racial Equity Audits can be designed to help identify if and where these issues exist within a company so that management can address them most effectively.

D. How Racial Equity Audits May Boost Financial Returns and Growth

Some studies have shown that “promoting racial justice can increase profitability and competitive advantage.” A study by McKinsey & Company found that implementing or improving racial justice policies can positively affect a company’s bottom line. As illustrated in the study companies with the highest degrees of ethnic/cultural diversity were 33% more likely to outperform their less diverse peers and companies with the most ethnically/culturally diverse boards of directors are 43% more likely to experience higher profits than their less diverse peers. A study by a Citigroup Inc. (“Citi”) global economist found that addressing racial disparities can have even broader macro benefits. According to this study “closing racial gaps would have generated an additional $16 trillion in economic output since [the year] 2000” and “by closing the various gaps between Blacks and Whites the U.S. could stand to gain an additional $5 trillion in economic activity over the next five years.” Racial Equity Audits could therefore prove to be a critical tool for companies looking to capture some of these unrealized gains.

E. How Investment Managers Especially Pension Fund Trustees Pushing to Address Racism May Be Consistent With Their Fiduciary Duties to Maximize Returns for Investors

A fiduciary’s duty is to act in the best interest of their beneficiaries and traditionally translates to acting to obtain the highest return on investment but it can be equally important that fiduciaries seek to minimize risk. Accordingly it has been argued that working to ensure that systemic risk in the marketplace is proactively addressed via for example a Racial Equity Audit is consistent with a fiduciary’s duties. Advocates of Racial Equity Audits believe that they are essentially intended to be implemented in furtherance of risk management and risk tolerance criteria that fiduciaries may choose to measure in order to protect their investments.

In addition there has also been a rise in ESG-specific funds as well as a growing number of ESG-specific products at mutual funds and other financial institutions. Beyond fund managers’ typical fiduciary duties to minimize risk and achieve positive returns these fiduciaries are explicitly mandated with making investments into companies that “aim to have a sustainable and societal impact in the world” based on ESG criteria or that “meet stringent environmental social and governance standards.” As the usefulness of Racial Equity Audits as a tool for ESG-conscious shareholders to measure a company’s adherence to ESG prerogatives becomes more mainstream it would be no surprise to see support for these audits grow.

F. How Professionals in the Area Believe Audits Should Be Conducted and the Importance of Independent Third Party Reviews

No two companies are identical. Every company has a different mix of products operations and services; therefore according to practitioners in the area it is important for participants in a Racial Equity Audit to identify the scope of the audit and benchmarks prior to conducting the audit. New York State Comptroller Thomas F. DiNapoli a staunch advocate of Racial Equity Audits has stated that such an audit should ascertain at least three things:

First whether a company’s policies practices and products are equitable and nondiscriminatory for employees customers and the communities in which they operate. Second whether any changes to existing programs or new measures or initiatives would help a company become more equitable and inclusive. And lastly whether a company has sufficient mechanisms in place to monitor effectiveness.

Practitioners also stress the importance of auditors using the right methodology including both quantitative and qualitative methods and for such auditors to review not only information provided by the company but to gather its own information. Accordingly auditors are encouraged to solicit information directly through surveys and interviews and to review historical records and a company’s performance against its peers.

Practitioners also believe that the audit process can be important for companies as a way to build trust with their stakeholders. To that end they believe companies should clearly disclose and explain the processes and personnel roles within a Racial Equity Audit and undertake to publicly share the results of the audit. Practitioners also stress the importance of identifying and engaging the “process owners” (e.g. the Chief Executive Officer Chief Legal Officer or Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer) as the persons who will actually drive the implementation of recommended initiatives. Advocates believe it is critical that the audit be conducted by an independent third party in order to ensure integrity and credibility throughout the process. Comptroller DiNapoli has observed that discrimination can be “deep-seated” within a company and “internal self-reviews have the potential to reinforce current structural impediments and biases” which is why he believes it is necessary for audits to be an independent assessment.

G. Which Companies Have Already Conducted Racial Equity Audits How Were They Conducted and What Were the Results?

Some companies have independently engaged in Racial Equity Audits or similar internal reviews usually in response to external pressures. As discussed earlier Starbucks undertook a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”) also conducted its own version of a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. The audit was led by Laura W. Murphy a civil rights advocate with help from a civil rights law firm. The Facebook audit began “at the behest and encouragement of the civil rights community and some members of Congress proceeded with Facebook’s cooperation and [was] intended to help the company identify prioritize and implement sustained and comprehensive improvements to the way it impacts civil rights.” The audit process included interviewing over 100 civil rights organizations several hundred more advocates as well as members of Congress. The aspects of Facebook that the audit focused on were informed by the aforementioned interviews which led to a holistic review of the entire company and not just a single aspect such as employment practices. The audit produced three reports which ultimately described how Facebook utilized the audit process “to listen plan and deliver on various consequential changes that will help advance the civil rights of its users” in a number of categories and also recommended implementation of specific action items including to (1) “continue to onboard expertise” (2) “build out the civil rights leader’s team” (3) “expand civil rights product review processes” (4) “require civil rights perspectives in escalation of key content decisions” and (5) “prioritize civil rights.” The thoroughness of the audit and the response and subsequent actions taken by the company have led to the Facebook audit being heralded by many as a big success.

H. Pushback to Racial Equity Audits

A number of other high-profile companies and financial institutions have been approached either by shareholders or civil rights advocates about conducting Racial Equity Audits. However not all companies have been as eager and willing to comply with these requests. As discussed further below several financial institutions including Citi JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman have resisted shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits stating that they would either fold such measures into their existing human rights assessments or that they didn’t believe it was the appropriate time for such an endeavor.

III: Rule 14a-8 Proposals—The Initial Stages of Advocacy

A. Shareholder Proposals

Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 shareholders may submit proposals to be included in a company’s proxy materials for its annual or special meetings of shareholders. Under Rule 14a-8 a company is required to include a shareholder proposal and related supporting statement in its proxy statement and list the shareholder proposal on its proxy card to be voted on with the company’s proposals if: (a) the shareholder satisfies specified eligibility and procedural requirements; and (b) the proposal is not excludable under Rule 14a-8(i). If the company determines that it is not in the best interests of the company to include a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal in its proxy materials it can (i) seek no-action relief from the SEC staff (the “Staff”) that if granted would allow the company to exclude the proposal without the threat of Staff recommendation of an enforcement action based on a procedural deficiency or a substantive exclusion under Rule 14a-8; (ii) take legal action in court to exclude the proposal; and/or (iii) negotiate with the proponent to withdraw the proposal. Shareholder proposals come from a variety of proponents including individual investors labor unions public pension funds shareholder activists and institutional investors and such proposals often focus on the environment corporate governance executive compensation and social issues. According to Forbes Magazine the past proxy season “set new records with at least 467 shareholder resolutions on environmental social and governance (ESG) issues.”

The Sustainable Investments Institute reports that 28 shareholder proposals dealing with racial justice had been included in proxy statements filed with the SEC as of April 27 2021. Certain of these racial justice proposals submitted by shareholders included proposals calling for Racial Equity Audits. For example the SOC Investment Group formerly known as the CtW Investment Group (“CtW”) a group that works with pension funds sponsored by unions affiliated with Change to Win a federation of unions representing nearly 5.5 million members submitted the following proposal to Bank of America Corporation for inclusion in its proxy statement:

RESOLVED that shareholders of Bank of America Corporation (“BofA”) urge the Board of Directors to oversee a racial equity audit analyzing BofA’s adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil rights organizations employees and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed. A report on the audit prepared at reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary information should be publicly disclosed on BofA’s website.

Similar Racial Equity Audit proposals were submitted by shareholders at several public companies during the 2021 proxy season with substantially the same resolution clause copied above but with different issues highlighted. In general Racial Equity Audit proposals ask the board of directors of a company to oversee such audits analyzing the company’s “business models—from policies to products and services—to determine whether they cause reinforce or perpetuate discrimination.”

B. Why Proponents Submit Racial Equity Audit Proposals

According to public policy analysts racial violence and the COVID-19 pandemic sparked an increase in Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals focused on racial justice. Several of the supporting statements for Racial Equity Audit proposals stated that:

High-profile police killings of black people—most recently George Floyd—have galvanized the movement for racial justice. That movement together with the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused the attention of the media the public and policy makers on systemic racism racialized violence and inequities in employment health care and the criminal justice system.

Proponents contend that Racial Equity Audits would help public companies “identify prioritize remedy and avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color” and would help a company’s board of directors assess such company’s “behavior through a racial equity lens in order to obtain a complete picture of how it contributes to and could help dismantle systemic racism.”

The chart below lists the proponents who submitted Racial Equity Audit proposals to public companies pursuant to Rule 14a-8 during the 2021 proxy season and the number of proposals they submitted:

C. Public Company Resistance to Racial Equity Audit Proposals

Boards of directors of public companies are “[i]ncreasingly . . . called upon to navigate the challenges presented by climate change racial injustice economic inequality and numerous other issues that are fundamental to the success and sustainability of companies financial markets and our economy.” After the May 2020 killing of George Floyd 66% of S&P 500 companies posted statements on their websites or social media accounts 36% made financial contributions to racial justice organizations and 14% stated in their communications that “Black Lives Matter.” While it has been observed that these companies were “quick to issue statements supporting Black Lives Matter and promis[ed] to do more to be responsive to non-white consumers employees and communities” most companies on the receiving end of a Rule 14a-8 proposal to implement a Racial Equity Audit have actively resisted such proposal by seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal from their 2021 proxy statements negotiating with proponents to withdraw their proposals and when the company had been unsuccessful with the foregoing recommending that shareholders vote against the proposals. In doing so these companies have argued that they have already taken measures to address racial justice such as “investing in Black entrepreneurs expanding credit and working to boost diversity within their ranks.”

Companies Sought No-Action Relief . Companies that sought to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals from their 2021 proxy statements by requesting no-action relief from the SEC argued that the exclusions set forth in sections (i)(3) (i)(7) or (i)(10) of Rule 14a-8 applied.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(10) a company is permitted to exclude a shareholder proposal if the company has already substantially implemented the proposal. The Staff has stated that “substantial” implementation under the rule does not require the company to have implemented the proposal in full or exactly as proposed by the shareholder. To demonstrate that they had substantially implemented the audit proposals companies argued they had (i) made pledges and commitments towards racial justice initiatives and made such information publicly available; (ii) issued ESG and/or diversity focused reports; (iii) issued press releases and public disclosures addressing racial inequality; (iv) implemented initiatives to advance racial equity; or (v) financially committed to racial justice initiatives and causes.

Rule 14a-8(i)(7) allows exclusion of proposals related to a company’s ordinary business operations. SEC interpretations of this rule provide that proposals that concern ordinary business matters but focus on significant social policy issues would not be excludable because “the proposals would transcend the day-to-day business matters.” In seeking to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals companies argued that these audits concerned day-to-day aspects of their ordinary business operations including: (i) “product sales and advertising;” (ii) “customer relationships;” (iii) the “nature of the company’s public relations messaging and communications with its shareholders and other constituents;” (iv) “workforce management;” (v) “relationships with suppliers;” (vi) “community impacts;” or (vii) “decisions regarding the products and services [the company] offers.” Furthermore these companies contended that the proposals did not focus on a significant policy issue that transcended their ordinary business.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(3) a shareholder proposal may be excluded from a company’s proxy materials if the proposal or the supporting statement accompanying the proposal is contrary to any of the federal proxy rules including Rule 14a-9 which prohibits a company from disclosing materially false or misleading statements in its proxy materials. The Staff has recognized that exclusion is permitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) if “the resolution contained in the proposal is so inherently vague or indefinite that neither the stockholders voting on the proposal nor the company in implementing the proposal (if adopted) would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty exactly what actions or measures the proposal requires.” Johnson & Johnson the only company to invoke Rule 14a-8(i)(3) during the 2021 proxy season to attempt to exclude a Racial Equity Audit proposal argued that the proposal was impermissibly vague and indefinite because “neither Johnson & Johnson nor shareholders would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty what actions or measures the proposal requires.”

The SEC considered the arguments described above to exclude the shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits and in each case the SEC did not concur with the company that the shareholder proposal should be excluded. Below is a chart listing the shareholder proposals submitted at various companies during the 2021 proxy season the proponent the regulatory basis to exclude the proposal invoked by the company and the SEC’s response to the company’s request for exclusion.

Companies Negotiated with Shareholders to Withdraw the Racial Equity Audit Proposal . BlackRock the world’s largest asset management firm and CoreCivic Inc. (“CoreCivic”) an operator of private prisons have agreed to conduct independent Racial Equity Audits after receiving shareholder proposals for such audits resulting in the proponents withdrawing their proposals. In the financial industry BlackRock’s decision distinguishes it from other financial institutions that have asked shareholders to vote against similar audit proposals and/or have sought no-action relief from the SEC.

Companies Recommended Voting Against Racial Equity Audit Proposals . Most companies who may have been unsuccessful in seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal or in negotiating a resolution with a shareholder to withdraw the proposal have recommended that shareholders vote against the proposals. These companies have asserted that they disagree with the “approach” of Racial Equity Audit proposals but are “aligned with [their] stated goal of addressing racial inequity in the financial sector.”

For example the board of directors of Citi recommended a vote against the Racial Equity Audit proposal included in its 2021 proxy statement noting that “[a]s recently as September 2020 Citi released a 104 page report on the economic cost of Black inequality in the United States titled Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps” and said its efforts on these issues are available to the public. Wells Fargo Co. (“Wells Fargo”) said it is conducting a “human rights impact assessment” and that it will update its Human Rights Statement to better align with the expectations of companies under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Wells Fargo also said it is making efforts toward “expanding [its] diversity and inclusion commitments with a focus on hiring promotions and turnover with increased accountability across all of those areas and [is] taking specific actions in support of these commitments.” The board of directors of Goldman recommended that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on a Racial Equity Audit saying it has taken additional steps toward racial equity in the past year including assessing its “shortcomings” and committing to hiring more analysts from “historically Black colleges and universities while maintaining [its] existing programs focused on other diverse populations.” Goldman also pointed out that it is “[b]uilding upon more than $200 million of grants in minority communities and to minority-owned businesses over the past two decades” and “in 2020 [Goldman] created the Fund for Racial Equity to support the vital work of leading nonprofits that are addressing racial injustice structural inequity and economic disparity which has committed $10 million from GS Gives in addition to matching employee contributions to recipient organizations.”

D. Proxy Advisors’ Positions on Racial Equity Audits

The two leading proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis & Co. LLC (“Glass Lewis”) have generally taken opposing views on Racial Equity Audits. According to Bloomberg Glass Lewis “has broadly said conducting the audits would help companies reduce risks of high-profile controversies that may result in customer and employee attrition regulatory inquiries and significant fines” and that “‘[g]iven broad societal changes it is particularly important for consumer-facing companies’ which depend on their customers’ trust and loyalty ‘to address issues of racial equity.’” On the other hand according to Bloomberg ISS has stated that “racial audits aren’t warranted because companies are taking ‘sufficient meaningful actions’ to address racial inequities such as expanding opportunities for people and communities of color as well as improving the diversity and inclusion of its workforces.” The following chart sets forth the recommendations ISS and Glass Lewis made with respect to each Racial Equity Audit proposal in the 2021 proxy season:

E. Amazon’S Response to a Racial Equity Audit Proposal—A Case Study

During the 2021 proxy season Amazon.com Inc. (“Amazon”) faced a shareholder proposal requesting the company to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. The proposal was submitted by Comptroller DiNapoli as trustee of New York State’s Common Retirement Fund for public employees which owns shares in Amazon. Comptroller DiNapoli was joined by other Amazon shareholders in requesting Amazon’s board of directors to commission a Racial Equity Audit that would analyze two main issues: (1) Amazon’s “impacts on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” and (2) the “impacts of those issues on Amazon’s business.” In response Amazon sent a letter to the SEC seeking to exclude the proposal from its 2021 proxy materials. Amazon argued that regardless of the proposal being “framed in the form of a request for a report” this did not change the fact that the “subject matter of the proposed report is within [Amazon’s] ordinary business” and thus excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

Amazon argued the proposal’s call to review its impact “on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” is a “broad survey on the impact of the Company’s policies practices products and services on societal issues” which implicates “routine business issues” such as “the products and services that the Company offers to its customers the Company’s business practices and operations the Company’s strategic decisions and the Company’s choice of technologies.” Similarly according to Amazon such an audit would “necessarily implicate[] a multitude of ordinary business matters relating to the Company’s day-to-day operations” which Amazon argued included decisions relating to among other things its charitable donations hiring decisions diversity and recruitment initiatives customer relations advertising public relations and communications with its shareholders and the kinds of products it sold. Despite the laundry list of examples Amazon cited in its No-Action Letter the SEC did not concur that the proposal was excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

In a webinar hosted by CtW Comptroller DiNapoli explained the importance of racial equity at Amazon and why shareholders should vote in favor of the proposal and argued that “racial inequity is harming the United States economy.” DiNapoli argued that “the pattern and magnitude of issues repeatedly facing the company demonstrate a need for a more in-depth review . . . Concerns related to workforce diversity treatment of minority workers environmental justice in communities of color surveillance and civil rights are just some of the controversies that have troubled Amazon.” For example current and former Amazon employees have accused the company of allowing racism to permeate its operations. The company’s environmental impact has also been called out for allegedly disproportionately affecting minority communities. Comptroller DiNapoli expressed concern with Amazon’s alleged lack of transparency stating that while the company has put policies in place to address this issue it “has not reported to investors the effectiveness or the process for completing its ongoing policy review.” In 2020 Amazon conducted its first human rights assessment which it referenced to support its position that there was no need to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. However Comptroller DiNapoli noted “a human rights assessment is not the same as an independent racial equity audit and shareholders should be weary of equating the two.”

On May 26 2021 Amazon shareholders rejected eleven shareholder proposals at the annual meeting. Among these the proposal for a Racial Equity Audit garnered the most support with 44% of the votes cast on this proposal voting in favor. Comptroller DiNapoli described the vote as “an immense success for a first-time proposal . . . [i]f CEO Jeff Bezos’ shares (70616270 shares 14%) were to be removed from those voting ‘against’ it the proposal received majority support.”

IV: The Focus of Racial Equity Audits on the Financial Industry

Financial institutions and asset management firms have become the focus of Racial Equity Audit shareholder proposals. According to CtW this focus is based on the belief that:

the finance industry has played a critical role in perpetuating unequal wealth distribution to communities of color. Whether it be modern day ‘redlining’ techniques related to mortgage loans to excessive checking account fees to most recently Payday [sic] Protection Program distribution communities of color have faced decades of discrimination as a result of the financial industry’s policies and practices.

While the financial institutions that have received Racial Equity Audit proposals have recently made philanthropic and strategic investments along with other commitments to racial equity CtW has stated that “the only way to effectively address racial injustice and economic inequality is careful study of how the industry’s products and services have contributed to this imbalance” which includes analyzing mortgage issuances the number of bank branches in minority neighborhoods or “banking deserts” and whether charitable contributions are “fully aligned with . . . public statements.”

A. An Outlier in the Financial Industry—BlackRock Agrees to a Racial Equity Audit

BlackRock’s response to the Racial Equity Audit proposal that SEIU submitted for inclusion in its proxy statement was an outlier among the other financial and asset management firms that faced similar proposals. Like the other companies that received shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season SEIU’s proposal urged BlackRock to “assess its behavior through a racial equity lens to identify how it contributes to systemic racism” including where its stated values are misaligned with the impact of its actions. The resolution included in SEIU’s proposal also noted that:

A 2020 report on proxy voting found that BlackRock did not use its clout as a significant owner to advance racial justice. BlackRock opposed nearly all shareholder proposals directly addressing racial justice issues including two proposals at Amazon seeking disclosure regarding hate-promoting products and effects of its facial recognition technology on people of color.

According to SEIU BlackRock “decided that the SEIU proposal is too important to wait until they are voted on at their shareholder meetings” and announced its plans to voluntarily conduct an independent racial audit of its operations. As a result the shareholder proposal was withdrawn and SEIU announced that it was currently working with BlackRock to bring about “needed change within the company and the financial services industry.” Commentators anticipate that BlackRock’s commitment to a Racial Equity Audit “could sway other financial services companies to follow in its footsteps.”

V: Developments for Future Proxy Seasons

A. Racial Audits May Be Here to Stay

ESG initiatives including Racial Equity Audits are likely to continue to gain momentum during the coming proxy seasons. As ESG issues garner more media attention and as younger generations move into the investing space these issues and related disclosures may become increasingly important to consumers investors and other stakeholders. Racial Equity Audits could emerge as a critical tool for companies to evaluate their current social impact and provide an objective method for investors to monitor their investments and potentially identify new companies that could benefit from increased social and economic engagement.

While we witnessed an increase in shareholder proposals related to Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season all such proposals were either withdrawn or defeated. However as Racial Equity Audits become more commonplace and enter the cultural norm these proposals may begin to resonate with more stakeholders and be approved by shareholders as early as the next proxy season.

B. Proactive Companies May Try to Cut These Initiatives Off at the Pass

In light of the anticipated increase in the number of Racial Equity Audit proposals in the coming proxy seasons we may see a corresponding rise in the number of companies that follow BlackRock’s lead and voluntarily conduct their own Racial Equity Audits. Proponents of Racial Equity Audits warn that such audits should be conducted in a robust manner by fully independent third parties and that the subject companies take action to address deficiencies shortcomings and concerns uncovered by the audits. Otherwise these proponents posit a lackluster or hastily conducted Racial Equity Audit or failure to take meaningful action in response to an audit may actually have the opposite effect for the implementing institution—instead of insulating the company from potential proposals demanding Racial Equity Audits faulty or perfunctory audits may instead create a target on the institution’s back for ESG activists in the following years.

C. Proxy Advisory Firms Likely to Weigh In

No major proxy advisory firm has issued official voting guidance on the implementation of Racial Equity Audits—and the two largest advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have been split on their support for shareholder proposals requesting such audits. However in the coming years we believe this is an area in which the proxy advisory firms may issue official voting guidance. On July 28 2021 ISS launched its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey which included requests for feedback on Racial Equity Audits. ISS will use the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey as a “key component of ISS’ annual policy development process to assess potential policy changes across regions and markets for 2022 and beyond.” While ISS has largely appeared hesitant to support Racial Equity Audits in the circumstances presented in the 2021 proxy season the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey could change its future guidance and recommendations on such audits. As the area develops (and if more companies voluntarily implement these audits) Racial Equity Audits could become viewed as good corporate governance particularly if top proxy advisory firms issue official guidance supporting the implementation of such audits.

The proxy advisory firms’ level of guidance may take varying forms—at the low end proxy advisory firms may increase a company’s ESG or corporate governance “score” for having in the past or recently conducted a Racial Equity Audit. At the higher end proxy advisory firms may offer official guidelines on what they believe are minimum actions a company should take with respect to Racial Equity Audits in order to receive the advisor’s support. For example such guidelines may provide for a minimum frequency of Racial Equity Audits and indicate parameters on what attributes an audit must possess to be considered sufficient. In this case failure to have a Racial Equity Audit policy or refusal to implement such a policy after shareholders have approved a proposal to implement one may become a criteria an advisory firm would consider in making a recommendation for or against the re-election of a company’s chairperson of the governance committee and/or the re-election of other directors at the company’s annual meeting.

Clear guidance from proxy advisory firms would also be beneficial to companies considering implementing Racial Equity Audit policies by offering indications on what parameters constitute “best practices” and how frequently these audits should occur. By offering such guidance companies may find it easier to voluntarily implement Racial Equity Audit policies.

D. Potential Legislative or Regulatory Mandates

Even with an increase in the number of shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits it is possible that companies may not adopt them as quickly or as widely as the public and/or certain legislative bodies would prefer. If this occurs legislators and/or regulatory authorities may at some point in the future step in to close the gap between investor demand and practical implementation. We saw this occur in California with Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 discussed in further detail above. As the general public’s views evolve on ESG issues public pressure for certain actions—in this case increased diversity in public boardrooms—often influence not just shareholder advocacy but legislative action. The California legislature recognized the public desire to move towards greater diversity on public boards and codified set requirements. In this way legislatures and/or regulatory authorities have the ability to serve as the catalyst for change and wider-reaching adoption by forcing companies that might have been unlikely or slow to act on their own to adopt such policies.

Indeed the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion is currently reviewing legislation that would require banks to conduct Racial Equity Audits every two years in an effort to promote diversity and equity. The proposed Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act would require such audits by independent third parties of the subject companies’ “policies and practices pertaining to civil rights equity diversity and inclusion.” The initial debates on the draft legislation also considered adding to the draft bill penalties for non-compliance including fines of up to $20000 a day for failure to engage in such audits. The draft legislation would also require banks to investigate what ties they may have to slavery and disclose steps such institution would take to reconcile profits it may have received from slavery. The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Joyce Beatty and co-sponsored by Reps. Nikema Williams and Jesus G. Garcia and is currently under committee review.

Other external forces that may prompt public companies to adopt Racial Equity Audit policies are the SEC and the securities exchanges. Currently neither the SEC nor the major U.S. securities exchanges mandate publicly traded companies to make disclosures regarding Racial Equity Audit initiatives. However on August 6 2021 the SEC approved new listing rules proposed by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) requiring each Nasdaq-listed company to disclose certain information about the diversity of its board of directors and generally include a minimum number of members of its board of directors who are Diverse (as defined within the new listing rules). Accordingly as Racial Equity Audits become an increasingly important area for investors it is possible that the SEC and the major exchanges may eventually require companies to make further diversity equity and inclusion disclosures which may include the existence and frequency of a company’s Racial Equity Audits.

Legislative or regulatory requirements are not without their own risks and compliance with any such minimum standards would not be fool proof to insulate a company from potential ESG proposals and proxy campaigns. Racial Equity Audits and similar equity and inclusion initiatives that are not robust or designed with the aid of independent third party consultants may risk being perceived as mere “window dressing” and invite criticism from shareholders.

E. Companies Should Stay Informed in This Area

Given current trends in ESG public companies should stay informed on Racial Equity Audits and their adoption crafting and implementation. Further companies wishing to stay ahead of the curve may start by critically and objectively looking at their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion and identifying areas in need of improvement. If a company lags behind in this quickly developing area we believe shareholders may become more willing to launch shareholder campaigns focused on ESG issues including demanding objective results through Racial Equity Audits.

22Supra note 10. The most recent and prominent example of the intersection between shareholder activism and ESG was the 2021 proxy contest at Exxon. Exxon has faced pressure from shareholders to shift practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon faces proxy fight launched by new activist firm Engine No. 1 Reuters Svea Herbst-Bayliss Gary McWilliams December 7 2020 available at https://www.reuters.com/article/exxon-shareholders-engine-no-1/exxon-faces-proxy-fight-launched-by-new-activist-firm-engine-no-1-idUSKBN28H2IO. Shareholder activist Engine No. 1 grew impatient with Exxon after years of declining financials and long-continued dependency on fossil fuels with no indication of future change. Id. As a result Engine No. 1 launched a proxy campaign in December 2020 to effect change on Exxon’s board of directors. Id. The activist investor nominated a slate of four director candidates with expertise operating energy companies and utilizing clean technology. Id. Dismissal and neglect of these concerns led to Engine No. 1’s unprecedented victory with three of its director nominees being elected to Exxon’s board at its 2021 annual meeting—sending a clear message that environmental concerns and proactive planning are deeply important to Exxon’s shareholders.(go back)

Allen — who made headlines last year when he took a racial-discrimination case against Comcast to the Supreme Court losing the case but nevertheless wringing concessions from the cable giant for his fledgling TV networks — is now eyeing an $8 billion deal to acquire Tegna a chain of 64 TV and radio stations that span more than 50 markets across the US.

Allen’s motives may have become clearer last week when Fox launched a 24-hour streaming weather app that media insiders say looks like the basis for a new cable-TV channel. Fox Weather will likely have significant leverage as it eyes a rollout given the clout of Fox’s news and sports channels — and the Weather Channel is in its crosshairs sources said.

Fox’s app which touts free always-on video streaming and 3-D radar will be broadcast from a newly renovated studio at its Midtown headquarters and can also take content from local Fox stations around the US. “Fox’s network of dual-polarity Doppler radars helicopters reporters and news crews around the world lets us show you weather in a way you’ve never seen before” according to its Web site — illustrating what the incumbent Weather Channel and Allen are up against.

Fox which shares a common owner with News Corp. the publisher of The Post declined to comment.

If 60-year-old Allen — whose Allen Media Group thus has amassed 33 local TV network affiliate stations — gets his hands on Tegna’s 64 stations his bargaining position with cable giants could get a major boost. Allen also could gain leverage to sell cable companies his other nine fledgling networks including Pets.TV Comedy.TV Recipe.TV and Cars.TV.

One problem: Allen is bidding for Tegna’s TV stations against the hedge fund Standard General whose CEO Soo Kim owns the Bally’s casino empire and is teaming up in his bid with Apollo Global Management the deep-pocketed private-equity giant. They have already submitted a fully financed offer of $22 a share for Tegna according to multiple sources. Tegna shares on Friday closed at $19.66.

That offer comes with its own issues — and could create an opening for Allen. Standard General earlier this year launched an unsuccessful proxy contest to oust Tegna Chief Executive David Lougee pointing to allegations of discrimination and racial bias against Tegna which Lougee denied. The Standard General-Apollo team would push out Tegna’s current management; Allen would keep them according to sources familiar.

Nevertheless sources said Allen may face an even bigger problem himself which is that the Weather Channel’s business took a major hit during the pandemic. As TV advertising dried up Allen Media’s earnings fell from about $185 million to $130 million before it closed in August on an acquisition of 10 stations from Gray Television — giving it a modest boost according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.

As a result Allen Media’s debt in recent months has climbed to more than seven times its ebitda a closely watched measure of profitability sources close to the situation said. That’s getting close to a red line where Allen Media could break its debt covenant — and makes it harder for him to secure financing for an ambitious acquisition the person familiar with the company’s finances said.

Allen — who got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last week — already in recent years has tried to make a transformative acquisition and failed. In 2018 he wanted to participate in the $4 billion auction for Tribune’s television stations and could not line up co-investors.

Last week Allen was reportedly talking to Oaktree Capital Management Fortress Investment Group and Ares Management about partnering on a last-minute bid for Tegna sources said.

A sticking point for Allen is that his co-investors want a big stake in Tegna because they’d be putting up most of the equity. Allen wants to maintain almost complete control sources following the situation said.

“I think he will cave” a source close to the situation said.

Allen made some lenders skittish after an audit they conducted this summer showed he’d drawn a hefty compensation package from his company which had recent annual revenue of around $600 million even as business was declining sources said. Allen paid himself a total compensation package of $50 million in 2020 according to sources familiar.

Flagging Allen’s compensation lenders charged him $40 million to allow him to borrow more money to finance Allen Media’s roughly $1.5 billion in debt according to sources familiar with the matter. Allen Media is paying a blended interest rate of around 7 percent sources said. If it weren’t for the spending concerns he would’ve been charged less than $40 million sources said.

4 The reality facing Allen and other prospective buyers is that Tegna might not even consent to a sale at all. Getty Images for Bloomberg Businessweek

Meanwhile Bloomberg reported that Allen recently borrowed $83 million to expand his Beverly Hills Calif. estate. Since 2018 he has bought a lavish apartment on Central Park South for $27 million a sprawling chalet in Aspen Colo. for $27 million and another estate on the Hawaiian island of Maui for $23 million.

If Allen doesn’t close the deal for Tegna his mini-media empire could find itself on shaky ground under the weight of excessive debt sources said. The Weather Channel Network earns less than 15 cents a month per cable subscriber and makes most of its money from advertising according to a person familiar with the situation. (Allen Media operates the Weather Channel television network and its streaming service. But IBM owns the Weather Channel brand as well as the site weather.com and the Weather Channel App.)

Still Allen Media did well in the September “upfronts” where media companies sell airtime to advertisers according to a source familiar with the circumstances.

But in addition to rival bidders Allen faces uncertainty from Tegna itself which has said only that it’s exploring a possible sale. Tegna which had two sale processes in recent years that did not result in a sale said last Wednesday it is reviewing its “options to create and return value to shareholders.”

Allen and Tegna both declined to comment to The Post.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bandhan Employees’ Welfare Trust and Angshuman Ghosh together buy a 25% stake in Nicco Parks & Resorts,"Empower Your Corporate Journey with Strategic Skill Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit IIM Lucknow Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit

Bandhan Employees’ Welfare Trust and Angshuman Ghosh son of Bandhan Bank founder Chandra Shekhar Ghosh together have bought a 25% stake in Nicco Parks & Resorts the largest amusement park in eastern India.They acquired the shares for Rs 35.5 crore from Nicco Corporation the insolvent cable maker placed for liquidation in 2017 by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).“This was the last remaining asset of Nicco Corp and we are pleased that the 25% stake has finally found a buyer for it” said Vinod Kothari the liquidator for Nicco Corporation.The new owners have made an open offer to buy about 12.2 million equity shares in Nicco Parks representing 26% of the company's equity capital. The offer is priced at Rs 30.5 per share with face value Re 1.Nicco Parks closed Friday at Rs 47.95 on BSE.The consortium of Bandhan Employees Welfare Trust and junior Ghosh emerged as the higher bidder at the e-auction held on October 28 people familiar with the development said.The Trust was formed in 2009 when Bandhan was a non-banking finance company prior to its transformation into a bank in 2015. It owns 14% in Bandhan Financial Services the promoter of Bandhan Bank. The Trust has around 3000 members mostly the old-timers in Bandhan Group.Bandhan Financial Services formed Bandhan Financial Holdings as the non-operative holding company for Bandhan Bank. The holding company owns 40% in the bank.“We earned a dividend from our holding and wanted to invest it to grow the corpus” said Arpita Sen a committee member of the Trust which bought 20% in Nicco Parks.The balance 5% is bought by Angshuman Ghosh.“Nicco Parks is an iconic amusement facility in Kolkata. That’s why I grabbed this opportunity to take a small stake in it. This is my first major step as an independent investor” Angshuman said.The West Bengal government one of the promoters of the Park holds about 25.85% in it through West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation . Nicco group promoter Rajive Kaul holds 4.6% while public shareholding is at 33.92% at the end of September.“The liquidation proceedings of Nicco Corporation will result in a distribution of nearly 35% of the dues to secured creditors and employees. It is also notable that employees' and workmen's gratuity claims were paid off fully” Kothari said.The liquidation exercise helped to garner about Rs 150 crore about Rs 40 crore higher than the bid submitted during the corporate insolvency and resolution process he said.Lenders including State Bank of India Canara Bank Central Bank of India and Srei Infrastructure Finance had a cumulative exposure of about Rs 325 crore in Nicco Corporation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWFsZXN0YXRlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2ZpcnN0LWhvbWVidXllcnMtdXNlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtaW5jZW50aXZlcy10by1zZWN1cmUtcHJvcGVydGllcy1pbi1zd2Fua3ktaW5uZXJicmlzYmFuZS1zdWJ1cmIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First homebuyers use government incentives to secure properties in swanky inner-Brisbane suburb - realestate.com.au,"A swanky inner-Brisbane suburb has become the unsuspecting prime target of first homebuyers armed with government incentives.

Exclusive National Australia Bank data shows there has been a 108 per cent increase in first homebuyer lending for properties in Hamilton between May and August.

The suburb is known for its swish homes and multimillion-dollar sales with the median house price hitting $1.99m after rising 34.3 per cent over the past year.

But it’s not houses first home buyers have been purchasing during the pandemic driven property boom.

They are using the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme Queensland’s First Home Owner’s Grant and First Home Concession or a combination of the three to secure units in Hamilton said NAB homeownership executive Andy Kerr.

First home buyers have recalibrated their strategy mid-year and were either looking to buy within an hour’s commute of the CBD or an inner-city apartment he said.

According to REA data the median price for a unit in Hamilton is $509013 after a 12.5 per cent jump over the past 12 months.

“First home buyers have capitalised on the apartment boom in trendy Hamilton right on the fringe of the Brisbane River” Mr Kerr said.

“They have started to hunt bargains and value and that’s why outer metro (houses) and inner-city apartments came into play.

“Outer metro had been the real story in 2021 but in the last four to six months we have seen start to move back to units.”

According to REA data the median price for a unit in Hamilton is $509013 following a 12.5 per cent over the past 12 months.

The NAB’s latest loan figures are due out in November but their most recent data (March) showed the average new loan had risen $12000 to $401000.

The suburb that attracted the biggest increase for first homebuyer loans Acacia Ridge some 16km south of the CBD had a 115 per cent increase.

It’s where the median house price remains very much within entry-level budgets at $524995.

Bray Park (60 per cent) had the third-highest increase in home loans followed by Springfield Lakes (51) Forest Lake (37) Ormeau (37) and Southport (31).

“The trends we are seeing are suburbs like Acacia Ridge where this is good local shopping and restaurants that are within striking distance within a 45-minute commute (of the CBD) that is the sweet spot we are seeing in most cities” he said.

“The impact of new builds in Ormeau was certainly something we did see because of the incentives that were offered.”

Of the regional cities East Mackay topped the list with a 55 per cent increase followed by Beechmont in the Scenic Rim with a 39 per cent rise.

The increasing focus on environmental social and governance (“ESG”) considerations at public companies including this year’s highly publicized proxy contest at Exxon Mobil Corporation (“Exxon”) has demonstrated the growing importance of understanding ESG and the implications it can have for investors and companies. Among the many ESG developments bubbling to the forefront of the markets in recent years is the desire of investors to see companies address social justice concerns. In particular shareholders have begun to request that companies conduct racial equity audits (“Racial Equity Audits”) which generally seek an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. We anticipate greater interest in Racial Equity Audits and similar initiatives in the upcoming proxy season and accordingly believe companies will be pushed to critically and objectively examine their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion to identify areas in need of improvement.

A. Overview of the ESG Landscape Today

ESG considerations can be broken down into three categories. First—environmental criteria which considers a company’s actions as a steward of the environment such as what steps a company is taking to address the depletion of the planet’s resources pollution and greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of climate change. Second—social criteria which considers how a company engages with all of its stakeholders (including employees customers and suppliers) rather than just shareholders including the treatment and diversity of its employees on the frontline management and boardroom levels the effects of a company on the surrounding community and whether a company is working with suppliers who share similar socially desirable values. Third—corporate governance which considers how a company governs itself and holds itself accountable taking into account the structure and diversity of a company’s board of directors the separation between management and the board of directors executive compensation equal and fair pay amongst employees and the extent to which a company or its management or board of directors are undertaking lobbying efforts making political and charitable donations or engaging in corruption or bribery.

With the increasing prominence of ESG awareness the market has also seen the rise of ESG-specific funds as a new form of investment vehicle. These funds have explicit mandates to make ESG-focused investments from mutual funds whose portfolio companies must score a high grade on ESG metrics to investment firms dedicated to ESG impact investing. In the U.S. market there are now over 600 ESG funds and exchange-traded funds for investors to choose from with approximately $161 billion in assets under management (“AUM”) which is more than double the AUM of ESG funds in 2010. According to research from Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) “ESG Funds were among the largest winners in 2020 taking in a record $60 billion in net flows nearly triple their 2019 total.”

In the meantime on November 9 2020 the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced the issuance of new final rules that expanded human capital management disclosure requirements applicable to SEC reporting companies. Since then SEC leadership has signaled that more comprehensive ESG-related disclosure could be mandated in the near future with SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee issuing statements earlier this year “directing the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings” and inviting input from “investors registrants and other market participants on climate change disclosure.” Former Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance John Coates also stated earlier in the year that the “SEC should help lead the creation of an effective ESG disclosure system so companies can provide investors with information they need in a cost-effective manner.” Based on these statements we believe there is a strong likelihood that the current SEC-mandated human capital management disclosures will soon be expanded to require additional disclosures covering environmental and other social initiatives and metrics further supporting a view that ESG awareness stewardship and reporting at public companies are here to stay.

As the ESG movement gains momentum and as the new wave of investors who factor ESG concerns into their investment decisions gain a larger share of the market companies are being advised to revisit their current policies and practices under the ESG lens. Companies that dismiss these concerns or lag behind their peers in addressing ESG matters may find themselves in the crosshairs of investors and proxy advisory firms or even state legislatures and federal agencies. On the other hand it has been found that companies that affirmatively adopt meaningful approaches to these issues may not only help progress environmental and societal goals but may also potentially see improved financial performance.

B. How ESG Ties Into Shareholder Activism

ESG considerations are becoming increasingly relevant to shareholder activists. This is because issues relating to climate change and the environment racial justice and diversity human capital and governance may influence companies at large and shareholder investment flows. Governance has long been a key focus of shareholder activists as corporate governance best practices including accountability of a company’s board of directors to its shareholders robust disclosure on executive compensation and independence of a board of directors from management have been found to have a readily apparent correlation with increased returns to shareholders. Recently however activists have begun to realize that social and environmental issues can also impact their investments in both negative and positive ways.

ISS and others have published a number of reports that have found that addressing social and environmental concerns correlates with companies either currently experiencing or having the potential to experience increased growth and profitability. As discussed in more detail below a company’s performance on ESG factors such as investment into renewable energy promotion of employee health and safety and contributions to the local community are pressing issues that can either benefit or adversely affect a company’s perception in the public eye operational execution and bottom line. Enhanced performance in these areas can lead to less scrutiny from environmental regulators increased customer loyalty more productive employees reduced employee turnover more lucrative business partnerships and increased profitability.

Improved ESG criteria is not a new area for activist investors. Shareholder activists have advocated for increased diversity in corporate boardrooms for a number of years. Concurrently with shareholder activists nominating an increasing number of diverse director candidates the voting policies of many institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc. (“BlackRock”) have been updated to reflect a desire to enhance boardroom diversity as have the voting guidelines of many prominent proxy advisory firms such as ISS. State governments have also codified ESG initiatives into law—California leading the charge with the passage of Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 which require a certain percentage of directors on the boards of public companies headquartered in the state be composed of females and individuals from underrepresented communities. Most shareholder activists are cognizant of the stance of institutional investors and proxy advisory firms on ESG issues and have increasingly incorporated ESG factors into their proxy campaigns.

C. Recent Push for Racial Equity Audits

Amongst the various ESG developments gaining traction in the markets is the recent push by shareholders for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits which generally consist of an objective investigation into a company’s practices policies and histories to determine such company’s impact on social issues and areas for improvement. In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020 and the subsequent civil rights movement and unrest many companies announced a number of initiatives and measures to address social justice issues including committing financial resources and reviewing their own policies and practices. However many advocates believe that without objective means to identify areas of improvement and monitor companies’ progress these commitments may be illusory and confirmation that these companies have in fact met their commitments could be difficult. Accordingly the 2021 proxy season saw an influx of shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (“Rule 14a-8”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended for companies to conduct Racial Equity Audits.

Just like its environmental and corporate governance counterparts addressing social concerns can be equally important to companies and investors alike as this can translate into among other things value additive results. For example following a racially-tinged incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks in 2018 where two African-American men who were waiting for a business meeting to begin were arrested the company performed a Racial Equity Audit which found that among other things racial sensitivity and the elimination of implicit biases are correlated to Starbuck’s core business plan of “creating an inclusive and equitable working environment as well as a welcoming ‘third place’ between home and work for customers.” In addition the W.K. Kellogg Foundation has found that “[b]y 2050 our country stands to realize an $8 trillion gain in GDP by closing the U.S. racial equity gap.”

II: Background and Overview

A. What Are Racial Equity Audits?

A Racial Equity Audit is at its core an independent objective and holistic analysis of a company’s policies practices products services and efforts to combat systemic racism in order to end discrimination within or exhibited by the company with respect to its customers suppliers or other stakeholders. Not only are Racial Equity Audits designed to help inform investors about their current and future investments from a social and financial perspective but are also intended to help companies craft their policies and practices to achieve their social justice goals.

According to certain proponents the point of a Racial Equity Audit is not necessarily to critique a company’s current platforms and efforts. Rather as argued by Trillium Asset Management (“Trillium”) a strong proponent of such audits the point of an audit is to embrace the notion that “if management is truly committed to make racial justice a critical element of its operations then in practice it can and should treat it like any other operations issue and audit it as such.” These proponents further argue that Racial Equity Audits should not be viewed as the end of a process for companies and/or shareholders looking to make a change; instead they can be a “stepping stone” to assist companies in developing and identifying a strategic plan to advance their goals.

B. What Impact Can a Racial Equity Audit Have on a Company’s Social Equity Policies and Practices?

The impact a Racial Equity Audit may have on a company may be felt in many ways. Racial Equity Audits can focus on various aspects of a company’s business including the treatment of customers at a company’s physical locations the diversity of senior management the targeting of products and even political contributions. Following an audit some companies have used the findings to develop a strategic plan to capitalize on opportunities to address racial equity moving forward. For example following the voluntary Racial Equity Audit conducted by Starbucks after the 2018 incident discussed above the company began requiring implicit bias training for employees setting public corporate diversity goals and implementing a number of other social initiatives. The public announcement of the Racial Equity Audit and related diversity equity and inclusion efforts appeared to not only rehabilitate Starbucks’ public image after the incident but helped the company become the “most popular restaurant stock on the S&P 500 with actively managed funds that are dedicated to ESG investing” according to RBC Capital Markets.

Racial Equity Audits may also find that a company’s existing policies and practices are not sufficient to address or may be perpetuating systemic social issues. For example in the supporting statement submitted by the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) to its Racial Equity Audit proposal included in the proxy statement for The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (“Goldman”) 2021 annual meeting of shareholders SEIU detailed Goldman’s alleged contributions to systemic racism. Specifically SEIU stated that “Goldman underwrites municipal bonds whose proceeds pay police brutality settlements.” Similarly Trillium on behalf of Christopher and Anne Ellinger submitted a Racial Equity Audit proposal that was included in Johnson & Johnson’s proxy statement for its 2021 annual meeting of shareholders in which Trillium expressed concerns with claims that the company continues to market its talc-based baby powder to “Black and Brown women after its talc supplier included the WHO’s ‘possibly carcinogenic’ label on shipments.” Proponents of Racial Equity Audits argue that a reassessment of internal policies and practices via such audits can identify the right levers to pull to begin to shrink these racial divides.

C. What Is the Democracy Case For Racial Equity Audits?

Civil rights advocates and proponents of social justice have long touted the moral and ethical considerations of closing the racial divide in America. Recently investors and companies have also begun to appreciate that positive financial returns are often associated with investing in initiatives working towards racial equality. Beyond the moral case and business case for conducting Racial Equity Audits and fighting systemic racism in general is the “democracy case” espoused by social justice advocates and that corporations can at times act more swiftly and have a more profound effect on current social issues than the government; therefore these advocates argue that corporations have a responsibility to address issues affecting our democracy. Racial Equity Audits can be designed to help identify if and where these issues exist within a company so that management can address them most effectively.

D. How Racial Equity Audits May Boost Financial Returns and Growth

Some studies have shown that “promoting racial justice can increase profitability and competitive advantage.” A study by McKinsey & Company found that implementing or improving racial justice policies can positively affect a company’s bottom line. As illustrated in the study companies with the highest degrees of ethnic/cultural diversity were 33% more likely to outperform their less diverse peers and companies with the most ethnically/culturally diverse boards of directors are 43% more likely to experience higher profits than their less diverse peers. A study by a Citigroup Inc. (“Citi”) global economist found that addressing racial disparities can have even broader macro benefits. According to this study “closing racial gaps would have generated an additional $16 trillion in economic output since [the year] 2000” and “by closing the various gaps between Blacks and Whites the U.S. could stand to gain an additional $5 trillion in economic activity over the next five years.” Racial Equity Audits could therefore prove to be a critical tool for companies looking to capture some of these unrealized gains.

E. How Investment Managers Especially Pension Fund Trustees Pushing to Address Racism May Be Consistent With Their Fiduciary Duties to Maximize Returns for Investors

A fiduciary’s duty is to act in the best interest of their beneficiaries and traditionally translates to acting to obtain the highest return on investment but it can be equally important that fiduciaries seek to minimize risk. Accordingly it has been argued that working to ensure that systemic risk in the marketplace is proactively addressed via for example a Racial Equity Audit is consistent with a fiduciary’s duties. Advocates of Racial Equity Audits believe that they are essentially intended to be implemented in furtherance of risk management and risk tolerance criteria that fiduciaries may choose to measure in order to protect their investments.

In addition there has also been a rise in ESG-specific funds as well as a growing number of ESG-specific products at mutual funds and other financial institutions. Beyond fund managers’ typical fiduciary duties to minimize risk and achieve positive returns these fiduciaries are explicitly mandated with making investments into companies that “aim to have a sustainable and societal impact in the world” based on ESG criteria or that “meet stringent environmental social and governance standards.” As the usefulness of Racial Equity Audits as a tool for ESG-conscious shareholders to measure a company’s adherence to ESG prerogatives becomes more mainstream it would be no surprise to see support for these audits grow.

F. How Professionals in the Area Believe Audits Should Be Conducted and the Importance of Independent Third Party Reviews

No two companies are identical. Every company has a different mix of products operations and services; therefore according to practitioners in the area it is important for participants in a Racial Equity Audit to identify the scope of the audit and benchmarks prior to conducting the audit. New York State Comptroller Thomas F. DiNapoli a staunch advocate of Racial Equity Audits has stated that such an audit should ascertain at least three things:

First whether a company’s policies practices and products are equitable and nondiscriminatory for employees customers and the communities in which they operate. Second whether any changes to existing programs or new measures or initiatives would help a company become more equitable and inclusive. And lastly whether a company has sufficient mechanisms in place to monitor effectiveness.

Practitioners also stress the importance of auditors using the right methodology including both quantitative and qualitative methods and for such auditors to review not only information provided by the company but to gather its own information. Accordingly auditors are encouraged to solicit information directly through surveys and interviews and to review historical records and a company’s performance against its peers.

Practitioners also believe that the audit process can be important for companies as a way to build trust with their stakeholders. To that end they believe companies should clearly disclose and explain the processes and personnel roles within a Racial Equity Audit and undertake to publicly share the results of the audit. Practitioners also stress the importance of identifying and engaging the “process owners” (e.g. the Chief Executive Officer Chief Legal Officer or Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer) as the persons who will actually drive the implementation of recommended initiatives. Advocates believe it is critical that the audit be conducted by an independent third party in order to ensure integrity and credibility throughout the process. Comptroller DiNapoli has observed that discrimination can be “deep-seated” within a company and “internal self-reviews have the potential to reinforce current structural impediments and biases” which is why he believes it is necessary for audits to be an independent assessment.

G. Which Companies Have Already Conducted Racial Equity Audits How Were They Conducted and What Were the Results?

Some companies have independently engaged in Racial Equity Audits or similar internal reviews usually in response to external pressures. As discussed earlier Starbucks undertook a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”) also conducted its own version of a Racial Equity Audit in 2018. The audit was led by Laura W. Murphy a civil rights advocate with help from a civil rights law firm. The Facebook audit began “at the behest and encouragement of the civil rights community and some members of Congress proceeded with Facebook’s cooperation and [was] intended to help the company identify prioritize and implement sustained and comprehensive improvements to the way it impacts civil rights.” The audit process included interviewing over 100 civil rights organizations several hundred more advocates as well as members of Congress. The aspects of Facebook that the audit focused on were informed by the aforementioned interviews which led to a holistic review of the entire company and not just a single aspect such as employment practices. The audit produced three reports which ultimately described how Facebook utilized the audit process “to listen plan and deliver on various consequential changes that will help advance the civil rights of its users” in a number of categories and also recommended implementation of specific action items including to (1) “continue to onboard expertise” (2) “build out the civil rights leader’s team” (3) “expand civil rights product review processes” (4) “require civil rights perspectives in escalation of key content decisions” and (5) “prioritize civil rights.” The thoroughness of the audit and the response and subsequent actions taken by the company have led to the Facebook audit being heralded by many as a big success.

H. Pushback to Racial Equity Audits

A number of other high-profile companies and financial institutions have been approached either by shareholders or civil rights advocates about conducting Racial Equity Audits. However not all companies have been as eager and willing to comply with these requests. As discussed further below several financial institutions including Citi JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman have resisted shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits stating that they would either fold such measures into their existing human rights assessments or that they didn’t believe it was the appropriate time for such an endeavor.

III: Rule 14a-8 Proposals—The Initial Stages of Advocacy

A. Shareholder Proposals

Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 shareholders may submit proposals to be included in a company’s proxy materials for its annual or special meetings of shareholders. Under Rule 14a-8 a company is required to include a shareholder proposal and related supporting statement in its proxy statement and list the shareholder proposal on its proxy card to be voted on with the company’s proposals if: (a) the shareholder satisfies specified eligibility and procedural requirements; and (b) the proposal is not excludable under Rule 14a-8(i). If the company determines that it is not in the best interests of the company to include a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal in its proxy materials it can (i) seek no-action relief from the SEC staff (the “Staff”) that if granted would allow the company to exclude the proposal without the threat of Staff recommendation of an enforcement action based on a procedural deficiency or a substantive exclusion under Rule 14a-8; (ii) take legal action in court to exclude the proposal; and/or (iii) negotiate with the proponent to withdraw the proposal. Shareholder proposals come from a variety of proponents including individual investors labor unions public pension funds shareholder activists and institutional investors and such proposals often focus on the environment corporate governance executive compensation and social issues. According to Forbes Magazine the past proxy season “set new records with at least 467 shareholder resolutions on environmental social and governance (ESG) issues.”

The Sustainable Investments Institute reports that 28 shareholder proposals dealing with racial justice had been included in proxy statements filed with the SEC as of April 27 2021. Certain of these racial justice proposals submitted by shareholders included proposals calling for Racial Equity Audits. For example the SOC Investment Group formerly known as the CtW Investment Group (“CtW”) a group that works with pension funds sponsored by unions affiliated with Change to Win a federation of unions representing nearly 5.5 million members submitted the following proposal to Bank of America Corporation for inclusion in its proxy statement:

RESOLVED that shareholders of Bank of America Corporation (“BofA”) urge the Board of Directors to oversee a racial equity audit analyzing BofA’s adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil rights organizations employees and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed. A report on the audit prepared at reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary information should be publicly disclosed on BofA’s website.

Similar Racial Equity Audit proposals were submitted by shareholders at several public companies during the 2021 proxy season with substantially the same resolution clause copied above but with different issues highlighted. In general Racial Equity Audit proposals ask the board of directors of a company to oversee such audits analyzing the company’s “business models—from policies to products and services—to determine whether they cause reinforce or perpetuate discrimination.”

B. Why Proponents Submit Racial Equity Audit Proposals

According to public policy analysts racial violence and the COVID-19 pandemic sparked an increase in Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals focused on racial justice. Several of the supporting statements for Racial Equity Audit proposals stated that:

High-profile police killings of black people—most recently George Floyd—have galvanized the movement for racial justice. That movement together with the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused the attention of the media the public and policy makers on systemic racism racialized violence and inequities in employment health care and the criminal justice system.

Proponents contend that Racial Equity Audits would help public companies “identify prioritize remedy and avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color” and would help a company’s board of directors assess such company’s “behavior through a racial equity lens in order to obtain a complete picture of how it contributes to and could help dismantle systemic racism.”

The chart below lists the proponents who submitted Racial Equity Audit proposals to public companies pursuant to Rule 14a-8 during the 2021 proxy season and the number of proposals they submitted:

C. Public Company Resistance to Racial Equity Audit Proposals

Boards of directors of public companies are “[i]ncreasingly . . . called upon to navigate the challenges presented by climate change racial injustice economic inequality and numerous other issues that are fundamental to the success and sustainability of companies financial markets and our economy.” After the May 2020 killing of George Floyd 66% of S&P 500 companies posted statements on their websites or social media accounts 36% made financial contributions to racial justice organizations and 14% stated in their communications that “Black Lives Matter.” While it has been observed that these companies were “quick to issue statements supporting Black Lives Matter and promis[ed] to do more to be responsive to non-white consumers employees and communities” most companies on the receiving end of a Rule 14a-8 proposal to implement a Racial Equity Audit have actively resisted such proposal by seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal from their 2021 proxy statements negotiating with proponents to withdraw their proposals and when the company had been unsuccessful with the foregoing recommending that shareholders vote against the proposals. In doing so these companies have argued that they have already taken measures to address racial justice such as “investing in Black entrepreneurs expanding credit and working to boost diversity within their ranks.”

Companies Sought No-Action Relief . Companies that sought to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals from their 2021 proxy statements by requesting no-action relief from the SEC argued that the exclusions set forth in sections (i)(3) (i)(7) or (i)(10) of Rule 14a-8 applied.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(10) a company is permitted to exclude a shareholder proposal if the company has already substantially implemented the proposal. The Staff has stated that “substantial” implementation under the rule does not require the company to have implemented the proposal in full or exactly as proposed by the shareholder. To demonstrate that they had substantially implemented the audit proposals companies argued they had (i) made pledges and commitments towards racial justice initiatives and made such information publicly available; (ii) issued ESG and/or diversity focused reports; (iii) issued press releases and public disclosures addressing racial inequality; (iv) implemented initiatives to advance racial equity; or (v) financially committed to racial justice initiatives and causes.

Rule 14a-8(i)(7) allows exclusion of proposals related to a company’s ordinary business operations. SEC interpretations of this rule provide that proposals that concern ordinary business matters but focus on significant social policy issues would not be excludable because “the proposals would transcend the day-to-day business matters.” In seeking to exclude Racial Equity Audit proposals companies argued that these audits concerned day-to-day aspects of their ordinary business operations including: (i) “product sales and advertising;” (ii) “customer relationships;” (iii) the “nature of the company’s public relations messaging and communications with its shareholders and other constituents;” (iv) “workforce management;” (v) “relationships with suppliers;” (vi) “community impacts;” or (vii) “decisions regarding the products and services [the company] offers.” Furthermore these companies contended that the proposals did not focus on a significant policy issue that transcended their ordinary business.

Under Rule 14a-8(i)(3) a shareholder proposal may be excluded from a company’s proxy materials if the proposal or the supporting statement accompanying the proposal is contrary to any of the federal proxy rules including Rule 14a-9 which prohibits a company from disclosing materially false or misleading statements in its proxy materials. The Staff has recognized that exclusion is permitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) if “the resolution contained in the proposal is so inherently vague or indefinite that neither the stockholders voting on the proposal nor the company in implementing the proposal (if adopted) would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty exactly what actions or measures the proposal requires.” Johnson & Johnson the only company to invoke Rule 14a-8(i)(3) during the 2021 proxy season to attempt to exclude a Racial Equity Audit proposal argued that the proposal was impermissibly vague and indefinite because “neither Johnson & Johnson nor shareholders would be able to determine with any reasonable certainty what actions or measures the proposal requires.”

The SEC considered the arguments described above to exclude the shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits and in each case the SEC did not concur with the company that the shareholder proposal should be excluded. Below is a chart listing the shareholder proposals submitted at various companies during the 2021 proxy season the proponent the regulatory basis to exclude the proposal invoked by the company and the SEC’s response to the company’s request for exclusion.

Companies Negotiated with Shareholders to Withdraw the Racial Equity Audit Proposal . BlackRock the world’s largest asset management firm and CoreCivic Inc. (“CoreCivic”) an operator of private prisons have agreed to conduct independent Racial Equity Audits after receiving shareholder proposals for such audits resulting in the proponents withdrawing their proposals. In the financial industry BlackRock’s decision distinguishes it from other financial institutions that have asked shareholders to vote against similar audit proposals and/or have sought no-action relief from the SEC.

Companies Recommended Voting Against Racial Equity Audit Proposals . Most companies who may have been unsuccessful in seeking no-action relief from the SEC to exclude the proposal or in negotiating a resolution with a shareholder to withdraw the proposal have recommended that shareholders vote against the proposals. These companies have asserted that they disagree with the “approach” of Racial Equity Audit proposals but are “aligned with [their] stated goal of addressing racial inequity in the financial sector.”

For example the board of directors of Citi recommended a vote against the Racial Equity Audit proposal included in its 2021 proxy statement noting that “[a]s recently as September 2020 Citi released a 104 page report on the economic cost of Black inequality in the United States titled Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps” and said its efforts on these issues are available to the public. Wells Fargo Co. (“Wells Fargo”) said it is conducting a “human rights impact assessment” and that it will update its Human Rights Statement to better align with the expectations of companies under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Wells Fargo also said it is making efforts toward “expanding [its] diversity and inclusion commitments with a focus on hiring promotions and turnover with increased accountability across all of those areas and [is] taking specific actions in support of these commitments.” The board of directors of Goldman recommended that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on a Racial Equity Audit saying it has taken additional steps toward racial equity in the past year including assessing its “shortcomings” and committing to hiring more analysts from “historically Black colleges and universities while maintaining [its] existing programs focused on other diverse populations.” Goldman also pointed out that it is “[b]uilding upon more than $200 million of grants in minority communities and to minority-owned businesses over the past two decades” and “in 2020 [Goldman] created the Fund for Racial Equity to support the vital work of leading nonprofits that are addressing racial injustice structural inequity and economic disparity which has committed $10 million from GS Gives in addition to matching employee contributions to recipient organizations.”

D. Proxy Advisors’ Positions on Racial Equity Audits

The two leading proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis & Co. LLC (“Glass Lewis”) have generally taken opposing views on Racial Equity Audits. According to Bloomberg Glass Lewis “has broadly said conducting the audits would help companies reduce risks of high-profile controversies that may result in customer and employee attrition regulatory inquiries and significant fines” and that “‘[g]iven broad societal changes it is particularly important for consumer-facing companies’ which depend on their customers’ trust and loyalty ‘to address issues of racial equity.’” On the other hand according to Bloomberg ISS has stated that “racial audits aren’t warranted because companies are taking ‘sufficient meaningful actions’ to address racial inequities such as expanding opportunities for people and communities of color as well as improving the diversity and inclusion of its workforces.” The following chart sets forth the recommendations ISS and Glass Lewis made with respect to each Racial Equity Audit proposal in the 2021 proxy season:

E. Amazon’S Response to a Racial Equity Audit Proposal—A Case Study

During the 2021 proxy season Amazon.com Inc. (“Amazon”) faced a shareholder proposal requesting the company to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. The proposal was submitted by Comptroller DiNapoli as trustee of New York State’s Common Retirement Fund for public employees which owns shares in Amazon. Comptroller DiNapoli was joined by other Amazon shareholders in requesting Amazon’s board of directors to commission a Racial Equity Audit that would analyze two main issues: (1) Amazon’s “impacts on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” and (2) the “impacts of those issues on Amazon’s business.” In response Amazon sent a letter to the SEC seeking to exclude the proposal from its 2021 proxy materials. Amazon argued that regardless of the proposal being “framed in the form of a request for a report” this did not change the fact that the “subject matter of the proposed report is within [Amazon’s] ordinary business” and thus excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

Amazon argued the proposal’s call to review its impact “on civil rights equity diversity and inclusion” is a “broad survey on the impact of the Company’s policies practices products and services on societal issues” which implicates “routine business issues” such as “the products and services that the Company offers to its customers the Company’s business practices and operations the Company’s strategic decisions and the Company’s choice of technologies.” Similarly according to Amazon such an audit would “necessarily implicate[] a multitude of ordinary business matters relating to the Company’s day-to-day operations” which Amazon argued included decisions relating to among other things its charitable donations hiring decisions diversity and recruitment initiatives customer relations advertising public relations and communications with its shareholders and the kinds of products it sold. Despite the laundry list of examples Amazon cited in its No-Action Letter the SEC did not concur that the proposal was excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

In a webinar hosted by CtW Comptroller DiNapoli explained the importance of racial equity at Amazon and why shareholders should vote in favor of the proposal and argued that “racial inequity is harming the United States economy.” DiNapoli argued that “the pattern and magnitude of issues repeatedly facing the company demonstrate a need for a more in-depth review . . . Concerns related to workforce diversity treatment of minority workers environmental justice in communities of color surveillance and civil rights are just some of the controversies that have troubled Amazon.” For example current and former Amazon employees have accused the company of allowing racism to permeate its operations. The company’s environmental impact has also been called out for allegedly disproportionately affecting minority communities. Comptroller DiNapoli expressed concern with Amazon’s alleged lack of transparency stating that while the company has put policies in place to address this issue it “has not reported to investors the effectiveness or the process for completing its ongoing policy review.” In 2020 Amazon conducted its first human rights assessment which it referenced to support its position that there was no need to conduct a Racial Equity Audit. However Comptroller DiNapoli noted “a human rights assessment is not the same as an independent racial equity audit and shareholders should be weary of equating the two.”

On May 26 2021 Amazon shareholders rejected eleven shareholder proposals at the annual meeting. Among these the proposal for a Racial Equity Audit garnered the most support with 44% of the votes cast on this proposal voting in favor. Comptroller DiNapoli described the vote as “an immense success for a first-time proposal . . . [i]f CEO Jeff Bezos’ shares (70616270 shares 14%) were to be removed from those voting ‘against’ it the proposal received majority support.”

IV: The Focus of Racial Equity Audits on the Financial Industry

Financial institutions and asset management firms have become the focus of Racial Equity Audit shareholder proposals. According to CtW this focus is based on the belief that:

the finance industry has played a critical role in perpetuating unequal wealth distribution to communities of color. Whether it be modern day ‘redlining’ techniques related to mortgage loans to excessive checking account fees to most recently Payday [sic] Protection Program distribution communities of color have faced decades of discrimination as a result of the financial industry’s policies and practices.

While the financial institutions that have received Racial Equity Audit proposals have recently made philanthropic and strategic investments along with other commitments to racial equity CtW has stated that “the only way to effectively address racial injustice and economic inequality is careful study of how the industry’s products and services have contributed to this imbalance” which includes analyzing mortgage issuances the number of bank branches in minority neighborhoods or “banking deserts” and whether charitable contributions are “fully aligned with . . . public statements.”

A. An Outlier in the Financial Industry—BlackRock Agrees to a Racial Equity Audit

BlackRock’s response to the Racial Equity Audit proposal that SEIU submitted for inclusion in its proxy statement was an outlier among the other financial and asset management firms that faced similar proposals. Like the other companies that received shareholder proposals on Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season SEIU’s proposal urged BlackRock to “assess its behavior through a racial equity lens to identify how it contributes to systemic racism” including where its stated values are misaligned with the impact of its actions. The resolution included in SEIU’s proposal also noted that:

A 2020 report on proxy voting found that BlackRock did not use its clout as a significant owner to advance racial justice. BlackRock opposed nearly all shareholder proposals directly addressing racial justice issues including two proposals at Amazon seeking disclosure regarding hate-promoting products and effects of its facial recognition technology on people of color.

According to SEIU BlackRock “decided that the SEIU proposal is too important to wait until they are voted on at their shareholder meetings” and announced its plans to voluntarily conduct an independent racial audit of its operations. As a result the shareholder proposal was withdrawn and SEIU announced that it was currently working with BlackRock to bring about “needed change within the company and the financial services industry.” Commentators anticipate that BlackRock’s commitment to a Racial Equity Audit “could sway other financial services companies to follow in its footsteps.”

V: Developments for Future Proxy Seasons

A. Racial Audits May Be Here to Stay

ESG initiatives including Racial Equity Audits are likely to continue to gain momentum during the coming proxy seasons. As ESG issues garner more media attention and as younger generations move into the investing space these issues and related disclosures may become increasingly important to consumers investors and other stakeholders. Racial Equity Audits could emerge as a critical tool for companies to evaluate their current social impact and provide an objective method for investors to monitor their investments and potentially identify new companies that could benefit from increased social and economic engagement.

While we witnessed an increase in shareholder proposals related to Racial Equity Audits in the 2021 proxy season all such proposals were either withdrawn or defeated. However as Racial Equity Audits become more commonplace and enter the cultural norm these proposals may begin to resonate with more stakeholders and be approved by shareholders as early as the next proxy season.

B. Proactive Companies May Try to Cut These Initiatives Off at the Pass

In light of the anticipated increase in the number of Racial Equity Audit proposals in the coming proxy seasons we may see a corresponding rise in the number of companies that follow BlackRock’s lead and voluntarily conduct their own Racial Equity Audits. Proponents of Racial Equity Audits warn that such audits should be conducted in a robust manner by fully independent third parties and that the subject companies take action to address deficiencies shortcomings and concerns uncovered by the audits. Otherwise these proponents posit a lackluster or hastily conducted Racial Equity Audit or failure to take meaningful action in response to an audit may actually have the opposite effect for the implementing institution—instead of insulating the company from potential proposals demanding Racial Equity Audits faulty or perfunctory audits may instead create a target on the institution’s back for ESG activists in the following years.

C. Proxy Advisory Firms Likely to Weigh In

No major proxy advisory firm has issued official voting guidance on the implementation of Racial Equity Audits—and the two largest advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have been split on their support for shareholder proposals requesting such audits. However in the coming years we believe this is an area in which the proxy advisory firms may issue official voting guidance. On July 28 2021 ISS launched its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey which included requests for feedback on Racial Equity Audits. ISS will use the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey as a “key component of ISS’ annual policy development process to assess potential policy changes across regions and markets for 2022 and beyond.” While ISS has largely appeared hesitant to support Racial Equity Audits in the circumstances presented in the 2021 proxy season the results from its Annual Benchmark Policy Survey could change its future guidance and recommendations on such audits. As the area develops (and if more companies voluntarily implement these audits) Racial Equity Audits could become viewed as good corporate governance particularly if top proxy advisory firms issue official guidance supporting the implementation of such audits.

The proxy advisory firms’ level of guidance may take varying forms—at the low end proxy advisory firms may increase a company’s ESG or corporate governance “score” for having in the past or recently conducted a Racial Equity Audit. At the higher end proxy advisory firms may offer official guidelines on what they believe are minimum actions a company should take with respect to Racial Equity Audits in order to receive the advisor’s support. For example such guidelines may provide for a minimum frequency of Racial Equity Audits and indicate parameters on what attributes an audit must possess to be considered sufficient. In this case failure to have a Racial Equity Audit policy or refusal to implement such a policy after shareholders have approved a proposal to implement one may become a criteria an advisory firm would consider in making a recommendation for or against the re-election of a company’s chairperson of the governance committee and/or the re-election of other directors at the company’s annual meeting.

Clear guidance from proxy advisory firms would also be beneficial to companies considering implementing Racial Equity Audit policies by offering indications on what parameters constitute “best practices” and how frequently these audits should occur. By offering such guidance companies may find it easier to voluntarily implement Racial Equity Audit policies.

D. Potential Legislative or Regulatory Mandates

Even with an increase in the number of shareholder proposals requesting Racial Equity Audits it is possible that companies may not adopt them as quickly or as widely as the public and/or certain legislative bodies would prefer. If this occurs legislators and/or regulatory authorities may at some point in the future step in to close the gap between investor demand and practical implementation. We saw this occur in California with Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 discussed in further detail above. As the general public’s views evolve on ESG issues public pressure for certain actions—in this case increased diversity in public boardrooms—often influence not just shareholder advocacy but legislative action. The California legislature recognized the public desire to move towards greater diversity on public boards and codified set requirements. In this way legislatures and/or regulatory authorities have the ability to serve as the catalyst for change and wider-reaching adoption by forcing companies that might have been unlikely or slow to act on their own to adopt such policies.

Indeed the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion is currently reviewing legislation that would require banks to conduct Racial Equity Audits every two years in an effort to promote diversity and equity. The proposed Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act would require such audits by independent third parties of the subject companies’ “policies and practices pertaining to civil rights equity diversity and inclusion.” The initial debates on the draft legislation also considered adding to the draft bill penalties for non-compliance including fines of up to $20000 a day for failure to engage in such audits. The draft legislation would also require banks to investigate what ties they may have to slavery and disclose steps such institution would take to reconcile profits it may have received from slavery. The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Joyce Beatty and co-sponsored by Reps. Nikema Williams and Jesus G. Garcia and is currently under committee review.

Other external forces that may prompt public companies to adopt Racial Equity Audit policies are the SEC and the securities exchanges. Currently neither the SEC nor the major U.S. securities exchanges mandate publicly traded companies to make disclosures regarding Racial Equity Audit initiatives. However on August 6 2021 the SEC approved new listing rules proposed by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) requiring each Nasdaq-listed company to disclose certain information about the diversity of its board of directors and generally include a minimum number of members of its board of directors who are Diverse (as defined within the new listing rules). Accordingly as Racial Equity Audits become an increasingly important area for investors it is possible that the SEC and the major exchanges may eventually require companies to make further diversity equity and inclusion disclosures which may include the existence and frequency of a company’s Racial Equity Audits.

Legislative or regulatory requirements are not without their own risks and compliance with any such minimum standards would not be fool proof to insulate a company from potential ESG proposals and proxy campaigns. Racial Equity Audits and similar equity and inclusion initiatives that are not robust or designed with the aid of independent third party consultants may risk being perceived as mere “window dressing” and invite criticism from shareholders.

E. Companies Should Stay Informed in This Area

Given current trends in ESG public companies should stay informed on Racial Equity Audits and their adoption crafting and implementation. Further companies wishing to stay ahead of the curve may start by critically and objectively looking at their current internal practices and policies relating to equity and inclusion and identifying areas in need of improvement. If a company lags behind in this quickly developing area we believe shareholders may become more willing to launch shareholder campaigns focused on ESG issues including demanding objective results through Racial Equity Audits.

22Supra note 10. The most recent and prominent example of the intersection between shareholder activism and ESG was the 2021 proxy contest at Exxon. Exxon has faced pressure from shareholders to shift practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon faces proxy fight launched by new activist firm Engine No. 1 Reuters Svea Herbst-Bayliss Gary McWilliams December 7 2020 available at https://www.reuters.com/article/exxon-shareholders-engine-no-1/exxon-faces-proxy-fight-launched-by-new-activist-firm-engine-no-1-idUSKBN28H2IO. Shareholder activist Engine No. 1 grew impatient with Exxon after years of declining financials and long-continued dependency on fossil fuels with no indication of future change. Id. As a result Engine No. 1 launched a proxy campaign in December 2020 to effect change on Exxon’s board of directors. Id. The activist investor nominated a slate of four director candidates with expertise operating energy companies and utilizing clean technology. Id. Dismissal and neglect of these concerns led to Engine No. 1’s unprecedented victory with three of its director nominees being elected to Exxon’s board at its 2021 annual meeting—sending a clear message that environmental concerns and proactive planning are deeply important to Exxon’s shareholders.(go back)

Allen — who made headlines last year when he took a racial-discrimination case against Comcast to the Supreme Court losing the case but nevertheless wringing concessions from the cable giant for his fledgling TV networks — is now eyeing an $8 billion deal to acquire Tegna a chain of 64 TV and radio stations that span more than 50 markets across the US.

Allen’s motives may have become clearer last week when Fox launched a 24-hour streaming weather app that media insiders say looks like the basis for a new cable-TV channel. Fox Weather will likely have significant leverage as it eyes a rollout given the clout of Fox’s news and sports channels — and the Weather Channel is in its crosshairs sources said.

Fox’s app which touts free always-on video streaming and 3-D radar will be broadcast from a newly renovated studio at its Midtown headquarters and can also take content from local Fox stations around the US. “Fox’s network of dual-polarity Doppler radars helicopters reporters and news crews around the world lets us show you weather in a way you’ve never seen before” according to its Web site — illustrating what the incumbent Weather Channel and Allen are up against.

Fox which shares a common owner with News Corp. the publisher of The Post declined to comment.

If 60-year-old Allen — whose Allen Media Group thus has amassed 33 local TV network affiliate stations — gets his hands on Tegna’s 64 stations his bargaining position with cable giants could get a major boost. Allen also could gain leverage to sell cable companies his other nine fledgling networks including Pets.TV Comedy.TV Recipe.TV and Cars.TV.

One problem: Allen is bidding for Tegna’s TV stations against the hedge fund Standard General whose CEO Soo Kim owns the Bally’s casino empire and is teaming up in his bid with Apollo Global Management the deep-pocketed private-equity giant. They have already submitted a fully financed offer of $22 a share for Tegna according to multiple sources. Tegna shares on Friday closed at $19.66.

That offer comes with its own issues — and could create an opening for Allen. Standard General earlier this year launched an unsuccessful proxy contest to oust Tegna Chief Executive David Lougee pointing to allegations of discrimination and racial bias against Tegna which Lougee denied. The Standard General-Apollo team would push out Tegna’s current management; Allen would keep them according to sources familiar.

Nevertheless sources said Allen may face an even bigger problem himself which is that the Weather Channel’s business took a major hit during the pandemic. As TV advertising dried up Allen Media’s earnings fell from about $185 million to $130 million before it closed in August on an acquisition of 10 stations from Gray Television — giving it a modest boost according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.

As a result Allen Media’s debt in recent months has climbed to more than seven times its ebitda a closely watched measure of profitability sources close to the situation said. That’s getting close to a red line where Allen Media could break its debt covenant — and makes it harder for him to secure financing for an ambitious acquisition the person familiar with the company’s finances said.

Allen — who got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last week — already in recent years has tried to make a transformative acquisition and failed. In 2018 he wanted to participate in the $4 billion auction for Tribune’s television stations and could not line up co-investors.

Last week Allen was reportedly talking to Oaktree Capital Management Fortress Investment Group and Ares Management about partnering on a last-minute bid for Tegna sources said.

4 Allen reportedly wants a controlling stake in Tegna — but he needs co-investors. LightRocket via Getty Images

A sticking point for Allen is that his co-investors want a big stake in Tegna because they’d be putting up most of the equity. Allen wants to maintain almost complete control sources following the situation said.

“I think he will cave” a source close to the situation said.

Allen made some lenders skittish after an audit they conducted this summer showed he’d drawn a hefty compensation package from his company which had recent annual revenue of around $600 million even as business was declining sources said. Allen paid himself a total compensation package of $50 million in 2020 according to sources familiar.

Flagging Allen’s compensation lenders charged him $40 million to allow him to borrow more money to finance Allen Media’s roughly $1.5 billion in debt according to sources familiar with the matter. Allen Media is paying a blended interest rate of around 7 percent sources said. If it weren’t for the spending concerns he would’ve been charged less than $40 million sources said.

4 The reality facing Allen and other prospective buyers is that Tegna might not even consent to a sale at all. Getty Images for Bloomberg Businessweek

Meanwhile Bloomberg reported that Allen recently borrowed $83 million to expand his Beverly Hills Calif. estate. Since 2018 he has bought a lavish apartment on Central Park South for $27 million a sprawling chalet in Aspen Colo. for $27 million and another estate on the Hawaiian island of Maui for $23 million.

If Allen doesn’t close the deal for Tegna his mini-media empire could find itself on shaky ground under the weight of excessive debt sources said. The Weather Channel Network earns less than 15 cents a month per cable subscriber and makes most of its money from advertising according to a person familiar with the situation. (Allen Media operates the Weather Channel television network and its streaming service. But IBM owns the Weather Channel brand as well as the site weather.com and the Weather Channel App.)

Still Allen Media did well in the September “upfronts” where media companies sell airtime to advertisers according to a source familiar with the circumstances.

But in addition to rival bidders Allen faces uncertainty from Tegna itself which has said only that it’s exploring a possible sale. Tegna which had two sale processes in recent years that did not result in a sale said last Wednesday it is reviewing its “options to create and return value to shareholders.”

Allen and Tegna both declined to comment to The Post.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bandhan Employees’ Welfare Trust and Angshuman Ghosh together buy a 25% stake in Nicco Parks & Resorts,"Empower Your Corporate Journey with Strategic Skill Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit IIM Lucknow Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit

Exclusive National Australia Bank data shows there has been a 108 per cent increase in first homebuyer lending for properties in Hamilton between May and August.

The suburb is known for its swish homes and multimillion-dollar sales with the median house price hitting $1.99m after rising 34.3 per cent over the past year.

But it’s not houses first home buyers have been purchasing during the pandemic driven property boom.

They are using the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme Queensland’s First Home Owner’s Grant and First Home Concession or a combination of the three to secure units in Hamilton said NAB homeownership executive Andy Kerr.

First home buyers have recalibrated their strategy mid-year and were either looking to buy within an hour’s commute of the CBD or an inner-city apartment he said.

According to REA data the median price for a unit in Hamilton is $509013 after a 12.5 per cent jump over the past 12 months.

“First home buyers have capitalised on the apartment boom in trendy Hamilton right on the fringe of the Brisbane River” Mr Kerr said.

“They have started to hunt bargains and value and that’s why outer metro (houses) and inner-city apartments came into play.

“Outer metro had been the real story in 2021 but in the last four to six months we have seen start to move back to units.”

According to REA data the median price for a unit in Hamilton is $509013 following a 12.5 per cent over the past 12 months.

The NAB’s latest loan figures are due out in November but their most recent data (March) showed the average new loan had risen $12000 to $401000.

The suburb that attracted the biggest increase for first homebuyer loans Acacia Ridge some 16km south of the CBD had a 115 per cent increase.

It’s where the median house price remains very much within entry-level budgets at $524995.

Bray Park (60 per cent) had the third-highest increase in home loans followed by Springfield Lakes (51) Forest Lake (37) Ormeau (37) and Southport (31).

“The trends we are seeing are suburbs like Acacia Ridge where this is good local shopping and restaurants that are within striking distance within a 45-minute commute (of the CBD) that is the sweet spot we are seeing in most cities” he said.

“The impact of new builds in Ormeau was certainly something we did see because of the incentives that were offered.”

Of the regional cities East Mackay topped the list with a 55 per cent increase followed by Beechmont in the Scenic Rim with a 39 per cent rise.

However its origin story dates back decades prior.

Inspired by the illustrious Nike Air Max Plus from 1998 the Air VaporMax Plus proves just how modern technology can uplift iconic ideas. Famously the original Air Max Plus debuted at retail in 1998 and never left the shelves for more than 20 years to follow always stocked in concurrent colorway or updated retro form in some corners of the world.

Essentially the roots of the Air Max Plus date back to 1997 when Nike footwear designer Sean McDowell had arrived at the brand. Quickly he was tasked to create a new Air Max running shoe. Already having ideas that originated from his time hanging out on Florida beaches McDowell pulled from the elements by drafting a sneaker that had a sunset aesthetic on the upper upheld by support that looked like swaying palm trees. The breezy beauty became the Nike Air Max Plus a shoe easily recognizable thanks to its fluid design top-down 3M flash and of course new Nike Air cushioning.

While design details caught the eye of fashionable wearers around the world in 1998 the true selling point for serious runners at that time was the Nike Air Max Plus’s new Tuned Air technology. Serving as the debut model for Nike’s latest performance tech the Air Max Plus ushered in a new way to articulate the brand’s infamous Air Max cushioning. By using blow-molded Air bubbles backed by rubberized hemispheres in strategic spots Tuned Air cushioning was designed to offer a smoother more supportive ride for runners.

Over the course of the late 1990s and 2000s Nike would continue to reinvent its Air Max cushioning in a myriad of ways. However it was in 2017 when the most radical revision of Nike Air would hit the market in the form of VaporMax.

Taking seven years of ideation and engineering before it was fit to hit the market VaporMax mimicked running on air aesthetically while offering a more efficient ride technically. The full-length cushioning was fresh flexible and far less weighty visually than previous iterations of Nike Air providing the most futuristic rendition of the famed technology yet.

Instantly the new tech turned heads in the world of running while also gaining traction among fashion crowds. Having seen this phenomenon before Nike leaned into the upcoming 20-year anniversary of the Air Max Plus to modernize an old favorite with yet another new evolution of Air Max cushioning.

In 2018 the Nike Air VaporMax Plus was released.

Sporting a stronger more advanced stance than the iconic original the Nike Air VaporMax Plus quickly caught attention from fans hip to nostalgia but also honing curiosity about what was next. On the Air VaporMax Plus the Tuned Air sole was replaced by a more modern VaporMax unit while the upper elected a softer neoprene fit. The original’s palm tree styling became even stronger by way of bold TPU caging while 3M hits also appeared down the tongue and toe box as a nod to the original. For added effect the famous heel branding was carried over instead reading Vm Air rather than Tn Air.

In its introduction the Nike Air VaporMax Plus pulled from original favorites like the acclaimed “Hyper Blue” colorway seen on the Air Max Plus and its orange “Sunset” iteration. Tonal pairs in all-black and all-white also turned heads proving that like the original the Air VaporMax Plus could continually reinvent itself in new themes and colorways without missing a beat.

Over the course of its growth the Nike Air VaporMax Plus began to expand its range by releasing in beautiful “Be True” celebratory colorways as well as makeups that nodded the likes of other archival Air Max favorites like the “Neon” Air Max 95 and “Undftd” Air Max 97. The shoe became a hit from fashion elite such as A$AP Rocky as well as everyday mall shoppers looking for a loud look with plenty of modern cushioning. The Nike Air VaporMax Plus appealed to almost all due to its nostalgic lines evolved technology and accessibility at sneaker stores worldwide.

Even after years on the market the Nike Air VaporMax Plus has proven to have incredible staying power. Living as a lifestyle favorite among fans of all ages and less of a performance running shoe the VaporMax Plus remains in rotation at shoe stores in the U.S. and abroad. With no signs of slowing down countless colorways continue to be rolled out ranging in inspiration from Nike athletes Ken Griffey Jr. to black/hyper pink pairs reminiscent of the Nike Air Yeezy 2.

The same system that allows for a pair of Jordans to be shipped from Dongguan China to rural Pennsylvania with one click has also caused the cost of a 40-foot shipping container to skyrocket from $2000 to $25000.

The system — once thought of as perfectly efficient — is now being stretched to its limit.

Sports endemic companies have not been immune:

Nike could lose up to 160 million pairs of shoes due to factory closures in Vietnam which normally supplies around half its shoes.

Puma advised customers to shop early for Christmas as supply bottlenecks and manufacturing disruptions would mean a shortage of its products well into 2022.

After a surge in demand and difficulty supplying customers Peloton has seen its deferred revenues (collected before a good or service is actually delivered) increase from $99 million in Q1 2020 to $611 million in Q2 2021.

Apple left a potential $6 billion on the table due to a limited supply of semiconductor chips that affects everything from iPhones to Apple Watches.

Though Titleist parent Acushnet announced a 108% increase in sales in Q2 2021 CEO David Maher expressed concerns to shareholders about various levels of disruption in the supply chain leading to an 18x increase in wait times for custom orders.

Amazon increasingly focused on fitness and sports media rights generated $110.81 billion in revenue in the third quarter missing Wall Street estimates of $111.6 billion. The reasons cited included global supply chain disruptions.

The phrase “supply chain” was mentioned 3000 times on investor calls for S&P 500 companies in Q3.

How Did We Get Here?

In order to understand the current predicament it’s important to understand where we came from. From a macro perspective there are two concurrent factors that drove up demand and simultaneously constrained supply.

As companies idled production in the beginning of 2020 — anticipating an overall slump in demand — they were met instead with a global pandemic that shuttered individuals inside and prompted them to spend on physical goods rather than services.

Manufacturers have been slammed with orders for their products ever since.

The Golden Ratio

Now consider the interplay between business inventory and sales. In economic circles it’s known as the Inventory Sales ratio and reflects the relationship between manufacturing inventories and trade inventories versus sales. The ratio is currently hovering around its all-time low.

From an efficiency standpoint the low ratio is technically a good thing indicating that businesses are able to efficiently turn over their product.

In practice however it is more indicative of a mismatch between supply and demand with many consumers not having the level of choice they are used to.

Location Location Location

Back in 2018 when the U.S.-China trade war tariffs were first imposed some companies shifted production out of China to avoid tariffs and moved their factories to places like Vietnam.

The result? Not pretty.

Covid and particularly the Delta variant hit all of the major manufacturing hubs in Vietnam leading to factory shutdowns and halts in production. Consumer product companies have experienced reduced revenues and increased headaches as a result.

In a full reversal from the attempted trade war arbitrage — moving manufacturing out of China and into non-tariff impacted countries such as Vietnam and Taiwan — companies are now seemingly willing to eat the extra costs to ensure their goods get delivered.

In its September earnings call Nike CEO John Donahoe stated that 80% of shoe factories and 50% of apparel factories in Vietnam and Taiwan were closed which at the time represented 10 weeks of lost production.

The proposed solution? Moving operations back to China.

Solutions at Home

Some companies are taking a more domestic approach.

In February with mounting delays due to orders being stuck at port for five times longer than usual Peloton announced that it had increased its manufacturing supply by 6x. Increased supply however was not enough to stem the supply issues.

In a February 2021 letter to shareholders CEO John Foley stated that Peloton would be investing $100 million in air freight and expedited ocean freight to help speed up deliveries.

to help speed up deliveries. It also spent $420 million on acquiring Precor a U.S.-based exercise equipment company. Precor has two U.S. manufacturing facilities both of which will be utilized to manufacture Peloton products.

The company invested an additional $400 million in an Ohio factory it’s calling “Peloton Output Park.” The factory should in theory help Peloton reduce its costs over the long run.

While spending capital on logistical infrastructure is commendable the track record for companies bringing overseas manufacturing back home is mixed at best.

Looking to the Future

So where do we go from here?

In some respects we are already on the road to recovery. With society crawling toward a new normal and companies having new infrastructure in place to maneuver some of the complexities of the supply chain there does appear to be light at the end of the tunnel.

Nevertheless the past 18 months did highlight the need for change whether it was Peloton shifting some of their production back to the U.S. or companies opting to change their foreign manufacturing centers — and we can expect to see more adjustments.

Steve Lamar CEO of American Apparel & Footwear Association stated this month that retailers are looking to shake up the supply chain with many staking out suppliers in Central America or Africa as part of a “generational sourcing shift to diversify their supply chains.”

The short-term solution will likely require significant capital investment on expedited shipping and moving manufacturing out of areas heavily impacted by Covid.

The future may bring about an entirely new approach to logistics.

We could see new regions build out vast manufacturing and distribution centers and the ubiquitous “Made in China” sticker might even become a thing of the past."

Most people even the struggling golfers can only dream of winning so much money. And if they do there’s no way they can let that amount slip away for any reason.

However Hahn in a recent appearance in Golf’s subpar opened up about one such experience. With Colt Knost and Drew Stoltz he revealed how he forgot to encash in his first check.

Hahn admitted that back then he didn’t have a direct deposit set up. However he had a reason for it. Recalling the time he read the book ‘the secret’ in college he detailed “For me one of the things that I got from it was to visualize a check a million-dollar check coming to my house. That was all I wanted from my life… I just wanted the actual physical check.”

“So I win the Northern Trust. Got the physical check for 1.2 million” Hahn added. Obviously he was ecstatic. He took pictures with it and celebrated his win. However when it came to depositing the check he just said “Oh I put it in my glove compartment. No big deal.”

Meanwhile life went on normally and the money didn’t really reach his account. Two weeks went by and his wife asked him “How long does it take for it to clear a million dollar check? You went to the bank like two weeks ago and it still hasn’t hit our account.”

Suddenly it struck Hahn. He said “I’d left a million-dollar check in my glove compartment in my car for two weeks and I’d totally forgotten about it.”

When the American golfer finally reached his bank and presented his check the lady at the reception laughed. Not every day does a person walk into the bank to cash in more than a million dollars. In addition to the craziness Hahn left his identification in his car. When the helpers started selling services to him frustrated he said “Hey guys I just want to cash the check.”

“Since then I’ve gone direct deposit because it is a lot easier” he said. “But losing a check in the glove compartment doesn’t quite sit well.”

Northern Ireland's laboratory staff are a workforce of around 1100 people who are focused on diagnostics across cancer care blood services and Covid-19.

The team contribute to the vast majority of patient diagnoses from GPs and in hospitals.

Health and Social Care (HSC) pathology services perform around 40m diagnostic tests in Northern Ireland each year and these results inform over 80% of all healthcare diagnostic and therapeutic decisions for patients.

While their work is often unseen it's critical to our health service and never more so than during the pandemic which placed unprecedented demands on its services.

Ahead of National Pathology Week (NPW) the annual celebration of the important contribution pathologists make to healthcare Belfast Live paid a visit to meet some of the team based at Antrim Area Hospital.

Running from 1 to 7 November NPW aims to improve public awareness and understanding of how pathologists and scientists diagnose disease.

Biomedical science student Kathryn Ann McCombe 23 is two months into her training at Antrim Laboratory.

She is starting her journey in specimen reception before going through all the different stages towards point-of-care analysis.

""I started off learning the different tests in urines and how some are urgent while others are routine. I moved on to labelling samples and I'm currently in 'ins and urgents' making sure that any urgent tests such as a troponin that can tell if a person is having a heart attack get processed rapidly.

""I really loved this career path because of the pivotal role it has in a patient's journey"" Kathryn Ann said.

""A&E and a GP surgery would not function without the biomedical science results we produce in the lab.

""It's a very fulfilling role being able to change the life of a patient and give a true analytical value to their pain and being able to be believed by medical professionals.

""To be able to show them that they're getting into remission and their values are coming down is wonderful and the meaning to a patient is unbelievable"" she added.

Specialist biomedical scientist Steven Carmichael 33 is among those assisting Kathryn Ann in the first stage of her training and explains a typical day .

""We have quite a large catchment area within the Northern Trust with GP samples coming from Moira all the way up to Macosquin"" Steven said.

""A lot of these come to us in the evening so first thing in the morning we get our analyzers going and run our samples before getting ready for the next batch of samples coming in the afternoon. Meanwhile we're also trying to run urgent samples from ICU and A&E and keep on top of it all.""

Steven's journey to a career in pathology saw him following in the footsteps of another family member.

""My uncle was a biomedical scientist in Altnagelvin Hospital while I've two sisters who are nurses there too one is a midwife and the other is in theatre. We seem to be a healthcare family!

""It is a rewarding job and there are times when you realise that you've made a difference in helping patients. The results we provide are critical to their treatments and diagnoses"" he added.

Amy Campbell 25 is a fully qualified biomedical scientist based in the cellular and molecular pathology laboratory which focuses on cancer diagnostics.

Amy explained the reason behind her career choice: ""I didn't really have much of an idea of what I wanted to do but I was passionate about science and wanted to go down that route. I knew that nursing or medicine wasn't maybe for me so I started to look into other backgrounds.

""That's when I came across biomedical science and the idea of being able to work as a multidisciplinary team alongside doctors and nurses and able to carry out the tests and provide the results that would help in the diagnosis of patients. I am helping patients not front facing like the doctors and nurses but in the background.""

(Image: Belfast Live)

After a four year degree course at Ulster University Amy completed her placement within the hospital laboratory and was in the midst of trying to complete her final year project when she was drafted in to assist with the pandemic response.

""I was working full-time within Covid and supporting the nurses and doctors within the hospital. We were doing a lot of testing for care homes within the Northern Trust area for healthcare workers and nursing staff.

""Definitely I never thought at the age of 24 that I would be thrown in at the deep end. Final year is stressful enough but in the middle of a pandemic it was even more challenging trying to find the balance. The reward of knowing that your were helping patients and their families along with surrounding staff was nice.""

Amy added: ""People who work in the labs are often forgotten because we are in the background but I don't think they realise how much help we provide to the doctors and nurses. It's definitely a very rewarding job.

""Sometimes when you say you work in the lab people automatically think it's all about blood and urine but it's so much more than that. On a day-to-day basis it's so different and no two days are ever the same.

""You could be doing small biopsies one day and up to larger sections of breast or colon and you've also got the blood urine and faeces.""

(Image: Belfast Live)

Following in Amy's footsteps is final year student Emma Jayne Hutchinson 22 a trainee biomedical scientist in the same lab.

""We get all the specimens down from the hospital from small biopsies to larger colons or breasts so there is a very wide scope even within this one department"" Emma Jayne explained.

""Sometimes it's hard to explain the job and people are surprised by all the different things we do.

""Covid was obviously a stressful time but it was also good as I got to see a lot more that I wouldn't have in a normal placement year. I felt like I was making a difference and helping the hospital.

""I was allowed to do a lot more than I originally thought. It really opened my eyes because they explain it all at university but it's hard to picture until you're actually doing it.""

Last month Health Minister Robin Swann launched a new £40m Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to significantly improve the delivery of clinical diagnostic services for key areas of healthcare.

He said: “A world class digital healthcare service is at the heart of our future healthcare needs and the launch of LIMS is a shining example of transformation being delivered. LIMS is a modern and improved digital e-health solution the first of its kind in the UK that will future-proof HSC pathology services and boost Northern Ireland’s regional diagnostic capabilities across cancer care blood services and COVID-19.

“The £40m investment in the LIMS system using software from CliniSys supports the building of a new tailored platform. It will significantly enhance standardisation of pathology services across Northern Ireland resulting in better quality of care for every patient and will support all of our healthcare needs by providing 24/7 testing support to hospitals and GPs.”

The Department of Health said it has been working with the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) and the Pathology Network NI on a programme to modernise pathology services.

A spokesperson added: “A consultation in 2016 noted that laboratory tests underpin the vast majority of patient diagnoses and that demand will grow as HSC services respond to the needs of an ageing population advances in cancer medicine and the spread of genetic testing and precision medicine.”

What will it see? Here's everything you need to know:

Why a new space telescope?

The James Webb Space Telescope will be 100 times more powerful than its predecessor Hubble and will be capable of capturing extremely faint infrared light from the very first galaxies at the edge of the universe. It will also be able to study planets around other stars in our own galaxy examining their atmospheres for telltale signs of life. Originally scheduled to launch in 2010 and cost about $1 billion Webb — a joint venture among U.S. European and Canadian space agencies that took 10000 people to construct — experienced a sequence of maddening delays as costs ballooned to $10 billion. But the colossal telescope finally has been shipped to French Guiana in South America where it will be fitted onto a rocket and blasted into space on Dec. 18 beginning the most technically ambitious mission in NASA history. Should Webb successfully reach its destination nearly a million miles from Earth the telescope will earn its nickname ""First Light Machine"" as it sends back images of stars formed just 250 million years after the Big Bang. ""It's going to help us unlock some of the mysteries of our universe"" and ""rewrite the physics books"" says Greg Robinson Webb's program director at NASA.

How does it work?

The telescope utilizes several novel technologies. It relies on a 21-foot mirror made of ultra-lightweight beryllium chiseled into 18 hexagonal segments and coated with gold. Unlike most telescopes which house a mirror or lens within a tube to block out light Webb's mirror will be exposed to open space relying on five parasol-like sheets of aluminum-coated plastic — each as thin as notebook paper and as big as a tennis court — to block out light and heat from the sun moon and Earth. Webb includes four solar-powered cameras and sensors to collect data.

How does Webb differ from Hubble?

Hubble launched in 1990 sent back dazzling images from deep space and helped astrophysicists better determine the age of the universe the nature of black holes and the number of galaxies. It also led to the discovery that thanks to ""dark energy"" the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. That's where Webb comes in. By the time light from a 13 billion–year-old star reaches Earth the expansion of the universe has stretched the light's wavelength into the infrared spectrum similar to how a siren's pitch drops as an ambulance speeds away. For that reason only an infrared-focused telescope is capable of peering into the ""cosmic dawn."" Webb uses mirrors that capture six times more light than Hubble's and cameras with a 15-times-wider view. Hubble orbits the Earth at an altitude of 340 miles. Webb will be positioned out in space roughly four times farther away from the Earth than the moon for maximum light-gathering.

How does it get to space?

First the 14330-pound telescope must be folded origami-style to fit atop an Ariane 5 rocket. After about 30 minutes of flight the telescope will be ejected from the rocket. ""That's when the nail biting starts"" says Heidi Hammel a vice president at the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. To open the sunshield about 150 release mechanisms made up of 7000 parts must fire correctly over the course of three days. On the seventh day the primary mirror will unfold. ""Those who are not worried or even terrified about this are not understanding what we are trying to do"" says Thomas Zurbuchen head of NASA's science office. After a roughly 30-day journey Webb will reach Lagrange Point 2 where the gravitational tugs of the sun and Earth balance out creating a convenient region for space telescopes to park. Webb will orbit the Sun not the Earth.

What will Webb look for?

Answers to astrophysics' biggest questions. As it travels through space at 186000 miles per second light provides images on delay: The naked eye views the moon as it was 1.3 seconds ago Jupiter as it was 40 minutes ago and Andromeda — the nearest galaxy to ours — 2.5 million years ago. Space telescopes are often compared to time machines collecting light emitted billions of years ago. Scientists believe Webb will be vital for studying the end of the Dark Ages — the period between the Big Bang and the formation of stars. That could reveal insights about the ""dark matter"" that makes up about 80 percent of the universe's mass. Webb can see back about 150 million years farther than Hubble and thus may provide glimpses of the formation of the first stars solar systems and galaxies says Caitlin Casey an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin. ""With Webb"" she says ""we're going right up to the edge of the observable universe.""

Searching for signs of life

Recent breakthroughs in astronomy have established that most stars have orbiting planets which means our galaxy probably hosts billions of these ""exoplanets."" Planets around other stars are too distant and dim to image clearly but Webb can use its enormous capacity to gather infrared light to search the atmospheres of exoplanets for circumstantial evidence of extraterrestrial life such as the presence of water oxygen carbon dioxide methane and other chemicals. One planetary system that Webb will study is about 40 light-years away: a small star called TRAPPIST-1 orbited by seven Earth-size planets — three of which orbit in the zone where temperatures could be mild enough for liquid water to form. Researchers are particularly excited to measure the methane and carbon dioxide in the fourth planet's atmosphere. ""We all want to find another Earth don't we?"" said Kevin Stevenson an astronomer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. ""Webb will provide us the first opportunity to really answer that question.""

Now we could also convince ourselves of the performance of the GeForce RTX 3060. For this review we used an INNO3D GeForce RTX 3060 Twin X2 with the newer LHR chip. This addition indicates that it is a graphics card that was specifically slowed down for mining with the ethash algorithm in order to make the graphics card unattractive for so-called crypto mining. Unfortunately this approach did not have an effect in terms of price because the models are still listed significantly above the RRP (329 Euros/~$380). At just under 690 Euros (~$798) the INNO3D GeForce RTX 3060 Twin X2 costs more than twice as much. However this already makes this model one of the cheaper models that are currently available.

The GA106 graphics chip offers 3854 shader units and can access 12 GB GDDR6 VRAM. Thus the smallest model gets the second-largest VRAM of the RTX-3000 series. Due to the memory interface Nvidia only had the choice between 6 GB or 12 GB. In order not to sell another memory cripple as an entry-level graphics card the manufacturer made the right decision in our opinion. In the many gaming tests we could very often determine a VRAM utilization of more than 6 GB. The INNO3D model's power consumption (170 watts) is exactly on the level that Nvidia specifies for the reference design. This also applies to the clock rates of the graphics chip and VRAM.

There are no big surprises in the dimensions. With a length of 24 centimeters the INNO3D GeForce RTX 3060 Twin X2 is a conventional 2-slot graphics card. Furthermore the INNO3D GeForce RTX 3060 Twin X2 requires an 8 pin power connector. Externally up to four monitors can be operated simultaneously. For this there is one HDMI with the latest standard (2.1) and three DisplayPort ports (1.4a).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwODAtdGktZ3B1LWNvdWxkLWJlLWNvbWluZy10by1zdXBlcmNoYXJnZS1nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti GPU could be coming to supercharge gaming laptops,"Nvidia could be readying an RTX 3080 Ti laptop graphics card if the rumor mill is to be believed.

Speculation about higher-end notebook GPUs from Nvidia has been flying around for quite some time now although previous leaks from a few months or so back pointed to the possibility of an RTX 3080 Super model (plus 3070 Super for that matter).

This fresh spillage has pinned the Ti label rather than Super branding on the purportedly incoming RTX 3080 variant with the theory being that this product will be based on Nvidia’s GA103 GPU (GN20-E8) as noted in a tweet from Matthew Smith which VideoCardz spotted (Smith is the keeper of TechPowerUp’s GPU database).

it seems the RTX 3080 Ti Mobile will use the GA103 chip.October 30 2021

The leak as VideoCardz explains actually originates from somebody posting on a PCI Device ID database with the handle ‘Faintsnow’ who is presumed to work for a graphics card maker. Faintsnow added the details of the GPU and confirmed that it’ll be the ‘GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU’ when questioned on what Nvidia’s name for this graphics solution would be.

No other details are provided here so the info imparted is admittedly thin on the ground.

Analysis: Some kind of high-end laptop GPU inbound for early 2022?

Obviously we need to keep a healthy sense of skepticism about the veracity of this as that original source is a murky one really.

That said this is a rumor which has been kicking around for a while and it does seem a likely move for Nvidia to release a laptop GPU with more oomph in the near-ish future – previously the grapevine has held that this mobile graphics card (or cards) could be unveiled early in 2022. Meaning we might be looking at a CES launch in January 2022 and if that is the case we’d expect to be hearing a lot more from the rumor mill on this GPU in short order.

There has been some controversy in the past about whether the supposed RTX 3080 Ti or Super might step up from the GA104 employed in the notebook RTX 3080 card to use the GA103 as indicated here because as you may recall regular rumor peddler Kopite7kimi – who first spilled the goods on the GA103 laptop chip – said at one point that it was quite likely canceled.

Kopite7kimi chimed in with this latest leak as well speculating that maybe this new discovery could even be an RTX 3090 mobile not a 3080 Ti. On the naming front it should be noted that Nvidia has never used the Ti suffix for a mobile GPU so there’s that to bear in mind too when it comes to the name guessing game.

Whatever it ends up being called the possibility that Nvidia still has a more powerful high-end laptop GPU in the wings waiting to step up and become the new flagship for Ampere in gaming notebooks is definitely still alive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MjQ4MS9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA4MC10aS1tb2JpbGUtcnVtb3JlZC10by11c2UtZ2ExMDMtZ3B1L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile rumored to use GA103 GPU,"NVIDIA's high-end Ti GPU could land in the world of laptops with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti using the GA103 GPU teased for 2022.

NVIDIA is reportedly preparing a new high-end laptop GPU offering with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile which will reportedly use the GA103 GPU.

The new rumor is coming from Matthew Smith who maintains the TechPowerUp GPU and GPU-z database that NVIDIA is working on a new flagship mobile GPU. It will reportedly use the GA103 GPU (GN20-E8) but we don't know the total configuration (CUDA cores etc) just yet.

We should see the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile be quite a beast hopefully with around 7680 CUDA cores and a 256-bit memory bus. We could see 8GB or 16GB of GDDR6 memory used but it would be nice to see some of that ultra-fast GDDR6X memory used inside of a super-fast new RTX 3080 Ti Mobile GPU.

VideoCardz reports: ""We spoke with Matthew on the actual source of this information. The name originated from the PCI Device ID database.

GeForce RTX 3080 Ti coming to laptops?

NVIDIA could bring a high-end Ti variant to laptops for the first time.

According to Matthew Smith a maintainer of TechPowerUP GPU and GPU-Z database NVIDIA is now working on a new flagship mobile GPU called GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. What should immediately be noted here is that NVIDIA never released a Ti variant in this performance segment as Ti variants were usually reserved for X050 models at most.

It is said that the card would utilize the GA103 GPU (GN20-E8) but the exact configuration of this model is still to be confirmed.

The GA103 GPU is an old rumor that has not yet found a confirmation. The processor allegedly features up to 7680 CUDA cores. The GPU should retain a 256-bit memory bus which makes 8GB and 16GB configurations a possibility.

Is it RTX 3080 Ti RTX 3090 or RTX 3080 SUPER Laptop GPU?

The supposed flagship now has three different names and neither has been confirmed yet. The RTX 3080 SUPER had already appeared in a leak featuring Lenovo laptop (pictured below) but the Device ID repository submissions claim it is actually a Ti variant. At the same time we have prominent NVIDIA leaker @kopite7kimi claiming it may actually be RTX 3090M (aka Laptop GPU). None of these names besides the SUPER model have found confirmation in the actual leak yet.

That said we cannot be sure if NVIDIA is rolling out multiple new high-end SKUs or we are actually talking about the same graphics card only with three different names.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile May Feature Ampere GA103 GPU Core With Increased Core Counts

Currently NVIDIA's flagship mobility graphics card is the GeForce RTX 3080 which is based on the GA104 GPU core and features the same core configuration as the RTX 3070 Ti Desktop with 6144 CUDA cores and a 256-bit bus interface. The card features up to 16 GB GDDR6 memory but it looks like NVIDIA is working to release an even faster mobile graphics chip.

Official name right now is

GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU Dev ID 2420 — T4C Fantasy (@T4CFantasy) October 30 2021

You may remember the Ampere GA103 GPU SKU which was presumed to be an optimized version of the GA102 GPU core. The GA102 is not feasible to be part of the mobility lineup due to its huge power consumption requirements and the GA103 GPU will be no different but it will be optimized for mobile efficiency from what we have heard. As such the chip is expected to offer an increased core count with a slightly bigger memory bus.

TechPowerUp's GPU-z BIOS Editor Matthew Smith has discovered the NVIDIA Ampere GA103 GPU with the specific Device ID being 2420 (GN20-E8). According to Matthew the SKU is codenamed GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile. It comes in both standard and Max-Q flavors but Kopite7kimi speculates that it may be called the GeForce RTX 3090 Mobile. Previous leaks have also hinted at the RTX 3080 SUPER & RTX 3070 SUPER series. Well all these names confirm that this SKU will be fastest than the existing GeForce RTX 3080 Mobile.

As for TDP the RTX 3080 Mobile currently features 150 Watt plus designs so it is easy to say that the RTX 3080 Ti Mobile will be more power-hungry but still within the sub-200W segment. The chip would offer performance close to the RTX 3080 thanks to more cores and a larger memory capacity though we don't know what bus interface the chip would offer.

As for designs the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile with the GA103 GPU will be featured in the highest-end enthusiast laptops with insane cooling designs. It is likely that NVIDIA is expecting to announce this chip at CES 2022 along with their flagship RTX 3090 Ti to take retain its dominance in the high-end segment. This aligns with the launch of new laptops based on Intel's Alder Lake-P & AMD's Rembrandt APUs.

GlobalFoundries campus in Malta N.Y. Mary Thompson | CNBC

Semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries debuted on the Nasdaq this week valued at over $25 billion as it became increasingly evident that a global chip shortage could persist through 2023 or later. Now GlobalFoundries needs to convince public market investors that the company is riding a wave of increased demand for all sorts of microchips that won't fizzle out after pandemic-related supply issues abate and that it can increase profitability even as it spends billions on a capital intensive business.

""I think for the better part of the next five to 10 years we're going to be chasing supply not demand"" GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield said in an interview with CNBC. GlobalFoundries' clients include Qualcomm  MediaTek  NXP Semiconductors and Qorvo . Automotive companies and home appliance makers have been struggling for months to obtain enough chips for building products and now the problem is spreading to electronics manufacturers and their suppliers. Apple for example said it will miss out on more than $6 billion in sales this holiday season because of chip shortages. Intel likewise blamed its lower CPU sales on shortages in power supply and networking chips. But the shortages aren't for the most advanced chips that use the latest manufacturing methods. Instead the shortages are for what are often called ""legacy nodes"" or semiconductors that use older technology to perform functions like power management connecting to displays or enabling wireless connections. Those are the kinds of chips that GlobalFoundries a third-party silicon-wafer foundry specializes in manufacturing for its clients Caulfield explained.

(GME) filed a SEC disclosure after Friday’s close noting the departure of Chief Operating Officer Jenna Owens after just eight months on the job. Owens a former Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) executive was hired in March as part of GME’s highly-publicized ‘digital transformation’. However the company has offered few details about the initiative since that time and her departure may be viewed as a setback encouraging shareholders to jump ship.

Investors have lost patience with Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) after 2020’s strong run-up contributing to a 14% year-to-date loss. Driver shortages escalating ride-share fees government catfights and heavy food delivery competition may have taken a toll in the third quarter raising odds for an aggressive ‘sell-the-news’ reaction after Thursday’s post-close report when UBER is expected to post a 16-cent per-share loss.

Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied out of a deep basing pattern at 16 cents in August topping out at 35 cents a few weeks later. It posted a higher low in September and bounced once again nearly completing a 100% retracement into the prior peak on Thursday. The coin has been pulling back since that time but strong support around 25 cents should ease selling pressure setting up a potential buying thrust that may complete a cup and handle breakout pattern with an upside target just above 50 cents.

Watch Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) on Wednesday because the passage of President Biden’s massive infrastructure bill may depend on Tuesday’s hotly-contested gubernatorial election in Virginia. The sector has been trading in tandem with acrimonious negotiations for several months now rallying 31% in the last 19 trading days. A Republican victory may be viewed as a mandate against big government spending potentially shifting moderate Democratic votes to the ‘no’ column.

Ford Motor Co. (F) joined the EV bandwagon this year announcing a series of initiatives to compete with better positioned rivals Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and General Motors Co. (GM). The automaker beat Q3 expectations and raised 2021 guidance last week adding to an uptick that’s posted an impressive 94% 2021 year-to-date return. However the stock is now approaching resistance going back to 2011 raising odds for a reversal and decline that could last for weeks or months.

Helping to keep a lid on prices were concerns over rising U.S. supply and the possibility of fresh supply from Iran in the future. Underpinning prices were expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Russia and their allies known as OPEC+ would maintain production cuts.

On Friday December WTI crude oil futures settled at $83.22 up $0.41 or +0.50% and January Brent crude oil finished at $83.72 up $0.06 or +0.07%.

Potentially Bearish Factors Cap Gains

Crude oil gains were capped last week by a report from the government that showed U.S. crude stocks rose by 4.3 million barrels during the week-ending October 22.

Additionally Iran said talks on reviving the international deal on its nuclear program will restart by the end of November bringing it a set closer to boosting oil exports.

Limited Output Expectations from OPEC+ Supportive

An OPEC+ committee largely stuck to forecasts of a strong demand rebound this year and next ahead of a meeting next week at which the group is expected to rubber stamp a planned output increase of 400000 barrels per day (bpd) in December according to Reuters.

The Joint Technical Committee (JTC) which met on Thursday now expects oil demand to grow by 5.7 million bpd in 2021 120000 bpd below OPEC’s forecast in its latest monthly report two OPEC+ sources said.

The JTC left its demand forecast for next year steady at 4.2 million bpd one of the sources said.

OPEC+ forecasts are still higher than those of the International Energy Agency (IEA) which expects oil demand to grow by 5.5 million bpd in 2021 and 3.3 million bpd in 2022.

Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Russia and their allies – collectively known as OPEC+ – meet on November 4 to decide policy.

US Drillers Add Oil and Gas Rigs for 15th month in a Row – Baker Hughes

U.S. energy firms added oil and natural gas rigs for a 15th month in a row in October as oil prices soared to fresh seven-year highs prompting some drillers to return to the wellpad.

For the week the oil and gas rig count an early indicator of future output rose two to 544 in the week to October 29 its highest since April 2020 energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report Friday.

That was the seventh time the rig count increased in the past eight weeks. The total rig count was still up 248 or 84% over this time last year.

U.S. oil rigs rose one to 444 this week while gas rigs also gained one to 100 their highest since mid-September.

For the month the number of active oil rigs rose by 23 putting the total count up for a 14th month in a row for the first time since July 2017.

Our planet is changing. So is our journalism. This story is part of a CBC News initiative entitled Our Changing Planet to show and explain the effects of climate change and what is being done about it.

The blackened lava fields and billowing steam vents of an active volcano near Reykjavik Iceland are the backdrop for a new venture that could help change the global calculation on climate change.

The facility known as Orca captures carbon dioxide or CO2 right out of the air — essentially scrubbing the atmosphere of the greenhouse gas.

""Like imagine when we started 14 years ago there was absolutely no support for what we were doing"" said Christoph Gebald 38 a German-born engineer who's now based in Zurich Switzerland.

""I'm very excited about where we are.""

Gebald's company Climeworks which he co-founded has emerged as one of the early leaders in a technology known as direct air capture. The plant in Iceland is the largest of its kind in the world.

Scientists have known for decades how to take CO2 out of the air but applying the technology on a large scale and in a way that makes economic sense has been elusive.

With the COP26 climate summit poised to begin Sunday in Glasgow Scotland and the world searching for solutions to de-carbonize faster there's been a spike in interest in how new technologies can help get there.

The Conference of Parties (COP) as it's known meets every year and is the global decision-making body set up to implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in the early 1990s and subsequent climate agreements.

Climeworks is now among more than a dozen companies around the globe — including some in Canada — blazing a new and for some controversial trail by attempting to capture dispersed greenhouse gases to counter the effects of climate change.

Detractors suggest carbon-capturing technology is expensive and its impact on lowering atmospheric CO2 questionable.

In July hundreds of Canadian and American environmentalists joined forces to call on governments to stop investing in carbon capture arguing it takes the focus off reducing emissions which should be the prime directive of climate mitigation efforts.

The Climeworks plant is located on the site of one of Iceland's largest geothermal plants about 50 kilometres outside the capital Reykjavik. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

However their fight appeared to be aimed largely at the oil gas and coal industries and their investments to capture and sequester pollutants coming out of the stack.

Instead direct air capture aims to collect greenhouse gases that have already been dispersed in the air. Proponents say since the gases circle the globe such facilities can be built anywhere and used to clean the air of the entire planet.

Gebald said in a fight as all-consuming as climate change the technology can play a crucial role.

""We need direct air capture as a solution for stuff we cannot reduce otherwise. It's emissions from agriculture it's emissions from operations that physically have a hard time to avoid CO2 like aviation"" Gebald explained via Zoom as a CBC crew toured the Orca plant.

""Climate science is asking for this and Orca is delivering that product.""

The Climeworks facility is located about 50 kilometres outside Iceland's capital next to the Hellisheiði Power Station which is run by Reykjavik Energy.

It's a geothermal plant that taps into the heat of the Earth's core to provide a supply of clean cheap electricity.

Pipes carrying superheated steam criss-cross the hillside and power the enormous electrical turbines at the power plant.

The Orca facility next door appears relatively modest in comparison.

It consists of a series of modules the size of a shipping container that are filled with dozens of fans all attached to white tube-shaped filter bags.

The fans draw in the air from outside and the CO2 molecules chemically attach to the filters. The filters are heated shaking loose the captured gas which is piped off for the next part of the process.

WATCH | Taking carbon dioxide out of the air and turning it to stone underground:

The world's largest carbon-sucking facility Duration 1:16 Two companies — Climeworks and Carbfix — have partnered in Iceland to scrub carbon dioxide directly out of the air then pump it deep underground where it's turned into stone.

That phase is handled by Carbfix a publicly owned Icelandic company that is part of the electrical utility.

Kari Helgason Carbfix's head of research and innovation took our CBC crew into an igloo-like structure filled with yet more pipes.

There he said the CO2 is mixed with water and injected 800 metres below into the volcanic rocks where it disperses. Over months it interacts chemically with the basalt rock and petrifies turning to stone.

Helgason said Iceland's capacity to seal away such greenhouse gases is vast.

""Iceland could store about 50 times the annual emissions of mankind"" he said noting Carbfix is exploring ways of shipping in CO2 from other countries and burying it the same way.

Iceland's geology is largely made up of porous basalt rock an ideal place to store CO2 which chemically reacts with the rock and petrifies. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

Helgason said the extremely porous volcanic rock that dominates Iceland's geology is ideal for storing CO2 because there's no risk of the gas escaping. Nor is there a chance the process can have unwanted side-effects such as earthquakes which can sometimes occur during fracking.

""Nature cleans up after itself"" said Helgason. ""It takes CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it in rock. We are just speeding up the process using science and innovation.""

Carbfix pioneered the process by entombing unwanted emissions from the geothermal plant but now deals with the CO2 from Climeworks and possibly other companies in the future.

'A bit overwhelming'

""It's a bit overwhelming I must admit. Sort of like the Wild West with everybody scrambling to decarbonize now whereas we should have started 10 20 years ago.""

The Climeworks operation has the capacity to remove about 10 tonnes of CO2 per day or about 4000 tonnes a year.

To put that in perspective that amounts to only a few seconds of the world's annual emissions. But Gebald the co-founder said that is just the beginning and larger plants will follow with the hope of scaling up to 30 million tonnes annually within 15 to 20 years.

The final part of the capture and sequestration process happens in these igloo-like structures. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

In fact a Canadian company Carbon Engineering based in Squamish B.C. is designing a facility in West Texas that would have roughly 250 times the capacity of the Iceland facility — or more than one million tonnes a year.

It plans to use the empty reservoirs deep beneath old fields to seal up the unwanted gases.

""We'll start construction next year and the plant will go operational we think in late 2024"" CEO Steve Oldham told CBC News in an interview.

Oldham's firm has had a small demonstration unit at the company's site on Howe Sound since 2015. It's also building a new larger demonstration plant in Squamish that will be opening in the coming months.

Turning CO2 into synthetic fuel

Carbon Engineering's other ventures include a $1.3-billion partnership with the Upper Nicola First Nation that will use the carbon dioxide captured from the air to ultimately produce synthetic fuel.

The Texas direct air capture facility is being bankrolled by Occidental Petroleum one of the largest exploration and production firms in the world with Carbon Engineering providing the design and technological expertise.

""Why are we building a plant in the United States? Because they actually have the policies in place today that close the business case"" said Oldham noting a combination of carbon taxes and tax credits has helped make a persuasive argument that there's a value for companies to remove carbon dioxide from the air.

""Our prices for permanent removal [of carbon] from our first plant start at $300 US a tonne. We are very confident those prices will come down.""

Oldham who formed his company back in 2009 said it's extremely rewarding to see years of work finally being validated.

""Direct air capture is hard. You know CO2 in the atmosphere is 400 parts per million — that's the equivalent of a single drop of ink in a swimming pool. So pulling it out cost-effectively is tough. And that's why ourselves and Climeworks have been up this business for many many years.""

The arrival of Climeworks in Iceland created a lot of discussion at the recent Arctic Circle forum in Reykjavik.

Well-received in Iceland

The gathering brought together thousands of delegates from northern countries with the fight against climate change topping the agenda.

Although environmentalists elsewhere have voiced concerns about big oil companies backing direct air capture ventures the Climeworks operation and the role of Carbfix in burying the carbon have been well-received in the country.

""We really are at this point that we just need to fight in every battleground and we need everyone to come together"" said Tinna Hallgrimsdottir a prominent young environmentalist who has tracked Climeworks's progress.

""We can't just skip one thing. We just need to do everything at the same time. But the emphasis should always be on emissions reduction but this will come as something to help us just to bridge the gap that we need.""

In a conference call with foreign media on the eve of the Glasgow summit the British politician in charge of COP26 refused to be drawn into a discussion about how important direct air capture will be in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gases.

""I think we will see and you've seen embryonic technology starting to emerge and that will absolutely be part of the solution in terms of tackling climate change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvaWNlLndhbGVzL2hvdy10YXhwYXllci1mdW5kZWQtZm9yZXN0cy1pbi1taWQtd2FsZXMtaW5mbGF0ZS1jYXJib24tdGFyZ2V0cy1iZWZvcmUtYmVpbmctbG9nZ2VkLWZvci1wcm9maXQtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Taxpayer-Funded Forests In Mid Wales Inflate Carbon Targets - Before Being Logged For Profit |,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

• voice.wales has found that new forests being planted by large private companies using Welsh Government cash are set to chop them for profit shortly after the net zero by 2050 goal.

• Woodland Investment Grants rules and regs mention specifically that officials will allow subsidised forests to be chopped down around 40 years after planting just when the tress will be absorbing the most carbon from the atmosphere.

• The plantations are being used for carbon offsetting a practice seen as enabling the most polluting firms to continue emitting carbon into the atmosphere.

• Deputy Minister for Climate Change Lee Waters the MS who has spearheaded the grants has not responded to a request to comment.

Large swathes of land have been bought up across mid-Wales by faceless megacorporations for the planting of trees – but how do they make their money?

A new government grant scheme funds for-profit businesses to plant trees and encourages them to log the forests when they mature all whilst still contributing towards Welsh Government net zero targets.

One of these companies is called Foresight which has its swanky offices situated in the Shard in central London. They describe themselves as a “leading infrastructure and private equity investment manager”.

Foresight have dedicated their time to setting up a firm to focus solely on tree-planting Foresight Sustainable Forestry Company Plc and is seeking to float the new business with an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange of £200 million.

The company has been buying up land with four farms in Wales already already in their pocket to plant forests to generate carbon credits to sell on the market to firms looking to pollute an extra bit more after they’ve reached their government-mandated allowances.

Richard Kelly co-founder of Foresight Forestry said in an ad for investors that their clients can enjoy the benefits of “the creation of carbon credits from new forest planting schemes.”

These credits are bought by big businesses like airlines and energy companies to ‘offset’ their emissions. Foresight keeps their client list close to their chest but we know that by advertising the creation of carbon credits from their projects they act as a laundrette for the dirty companies who want to greenwash their activities and appeal to eco-minded consumers.

The system has allowed even oil companies to claim that their businesses are green by buying carbon credits in bulk. In April Occidental Petroleum one of the largest oil producers on the planet had allegedly bought so many credits generated by companies like Foresight that it could claim a two-million-barrel shipment was completely carbon neutral.

The whole system lays bare the way in which any mitigation of the climate crisis will only be conducted through the prism of the free market and will be built around the need to maintain company viability and profits above the need to cut carbon emissions now. Welsh Government appears to be assisting in this.

Foresight has already admitted that they will seek handouts from the Welsh Government which ministers have advertised in the form of the Woodland Investment Grant (WIG).

The projects of private companies that claim assistance from Government investment schemes contribute to forestry figures that measure the Welsh Government’s progress towards their afforestation goals.

Deputy Minister for Climate Change Lee Waters announced in July that Wales needs to plant 86 million trees over the next nine years to hit their goal of being net zero emissions by 2050 telling the press at the time that the Woodland Investment Grant is to be used “to support this ambition”.

But there’s a gaping hole in the plan: These forests funded by taxpayer money might barely survive past 2050.

The “attractive investment characteristics” are advertised by the company in a slick PR video that shows stock images of timber-yards alongside beautiful forests.

Foresight isn’t just making their money from generating carbon credits they also intend to log their forests for timber after around 40 years which would mean that their forests would only exist just a decade after the net zero target should be met.

voice.wales has delved into the rules and regulations surrounding the Woodland Investment Fund and has found that the Welsh Government in fact encourages the new forests to be logged when they mature.

The rules booklet reads: “National Forest woodlands should aim to maximise the benefits to people nature and the wider environment through the creation of multi-purpose sites.” This could include “large scale commercial timber harvesting businesses supplying more home grown timber” alongside “growing biodiversity.”

Foresight Forestry co-founder Kelly said: “It takes 40 years for newly planted forests to mature for harvesting.” This would mean forests being funded by the Welsh Government are likely to disappear just decades after the 2050 goal.

At the same time the rate at which the tree absorbs carbon changes throughout its stages of growing. A tree’s absorption rate whilst it is a sapling is significantly lower and it can take several years for a new tree to exit this phase. Research shows that when a tree reaches maturity it is better able to store carbon and slow climate change.

Marshall has joined Southern Miss and Old Dominion as part of a C-USA exodus and the three institutions shifting to the Sun Belt join six others that previously announced departures from Conference USA to the American Athletic Conference.

The Thundering Herd previously noted that they would not make a decision on realignment until hiring a new university president. Former Intuit CEO Brad Smith was announced as Marshall's 38th president on Thursday clearing the way for the school to make a decision.

""Marshall is well positioned for an exciting future in the Sun Belt Conference"" President-Elect Smith said in a statement. ""Our brand our athletic programs and our incredible fans earned this opportunity. This is a strong move forward for our university our athletes and our fans.""

Marshall has been a member of Conference USA since 2005 winning three division championships and the 2014 conference crown since joining the league. The Thundering Herd hired former Alabama associate head coach Charles Huff to lead the program in 2021. He is 4-3 in his first season.

Additionally sources tell CBS Sports that FCS power James Madison expects to join the Sun Belt after the Dukes' board approved a plan to explore FBS football. The decision requires state approval but is not expected to be an issue. Adding James Madison -- which was also targeted by Conference USA -- gives Old Dominion and Marshall a natural travel partner.

The addition of four schools would give the Sun Belt 14 football-playing institutions.

Old Dominion and Southern Miss publicly announced their decisions to leave for the Sun Belt Conference earlier this week. The schools will make the move no later than July 1 2023.

""While C-USA has proven to be an excellent home for ODU Athletics during our transition from FCS to FBS and we thank the C-USA membership and leadership for such an outstanding partnership the chance to enhance the overall athletic experience for the student-athletes fans and alumni of ODU in the SBC with regional rivalries represents the perfect opportunity for the continued growth and evolution of ODU athletic programs in our pursuit of national prominence"" Old Dominion athletic director Wood Selig said in a statement.

Old Dominion joined Conference USA as it transitioned to the FBS level during the 2014 football season. The program played football for a brief period in the 1930s but ultimately folded before restarting a football team at the FCS level in 2009. Bobby Wilder led the program from inception until 2019 posting a 77-56 record between FCS and FBS including a 10-win season in 2016.

The program has struggled since the breakout season however posting an 11-32 record since 2017. Former Penn State offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne took over the program in 2020 but ODU opted not to play football during the pandemic season. A move to the Sun Belt -- along with the potential rise of James Madison from the FCS ranks -- gives the Monarchs significantly more regional partners in the Carolinas and Georgia.

""We are thrilled to welcome Old Dominion University to the Sun Belt. ODU brings a host of strengths to our conference. They are competitive across all of their sports have a strong brand and are supported by a great fan base"" Sun Belt commissioner Keith Gill said in a statement.

Southern Miss announced it would join the Sun Belt Conference on Tuesday setting off a second wave of departures from Conference USA.

""Today is a great day for Southern Miss. I want to thank Commissioner [Keith] Gill and the Board of Directors within the Sun Belt for their faith in our institution and our ability to add value to the conference"" said Southern Mississippi athletic director Jeremy McClain. ""We are excited about adding our rich tradition of success and passionate fan base to a conference that values those attributes and look forward to working together to continue to elevate the Sun Belt on the national stage.""

Southern Miss has been a member of Conference USA since the creation of the league in 1995. The Eagles were once a nationally-relevant power under head coach Jeff Bower posting a 21-2 record in conference play from 1996 to 1999. The program has five Conference USA football championships under its belt with the last one coming in 2011.

It is interesting that the Sun Belt chose to add despite the fact that it hasn't been poached by other conference in the latest realignment wave. This round of realignment started in July when the SEC announced that it is adding Texas and Oklahoma out of the Big 12. The Big 12 responded by poaching UCF Cincinnati and Houston out of the AAC as well as independent BYU. The AAC then added six programs out of Conference USA -- Charlotte Florida Atlantic North Texas Rice UAB and UTSA.

The future of Conference USA is now severely in doubt. Dodd reported that Conference USA could be looking toward FBS independents like Liberty UConn and UMass or FCS programs that may be looking to jump to the FBS level.

""To say that [Conference USA] is not wounded would be to deny [reality]"" a source close to the discussions told Dodd.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY3Jlc2NlbnRjaXR5c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9vbGQtZG9taW5pb24tZWRnZXMtbG91aXNpYW5hLXRlY2gtb24tbGF0ZS1maWVsZC1nb2FsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Dominion edges Louisiana Tech on late field goal,"NORFOLK Va. – After Louisiana Tech was stopped on a fourth down late in the game Old Dominion got within field goal range and kicked the game-winner from 46 yards out to come away with the 23-20 victory on Saturday night at S. S. Ballard Stadium.

J.D. Head came into the contest early in the fourth quarter for Austin Kendall. The starting QB went down after completing a 33-yard pass to Smoke Harris to get LA Tech (2-6 1-3 C-USA) into the red zone.

Head coach Skip Holtz called Marcus Williams Jr.’s number on back-to-back plays and the running back punched it in on the second rush getting stuffed up the middle before bouncing it outside for the 7-yard score to give the Bulldogs a 20-17 advantage.

Old Dominion (2-6 1-3 C-USA) proceeded to go on a 20-play 58-yard drive (converted four third downs and one fourth down play) that ate up 10 minutes of clock and resulted in a game-tying field goal by Nick Rice.

With 1:52 to go Head completed three straight passes to get the ‘Dogs into ODU territory. On the ensuing drive the team gained seven yards on an offside penalty and a 2-yard run by Williams Jr. to set up a 4th-and-3 from the 45-yard line. After a timeout Holtz elected to go for it and Head threw a deep ball down the sideline to Bub Means but the ball carried out of bounds.

A 10-yard completion by Hayden Wolff and three straight carries by Blake Watson got the ball to the LA Tech 29-yard line with two seconds to go. Rice followed by making a 46-yarder to hand the Bulldogs their fourth loss of the season on the last play of the game.

There was not much offense generated in the early going as the game remained scoreless through the first 26 minutes of play. Each team managed to tack on 10 points in the final four minutes of the first half though. LA Tech got a 32-yard pass from Austin Kendall to Isaiah Graham and a 30-yard field goal by Jacob Barnes.

The Bulldogs outgained the Monarchs 335-311. Kendall finished 22-of-36 for 253 yards with his main target being S. Harris who had a team-high seven catches for 63 yards. Williams Jr. added 42 yards on the ground with one score.

ODU was anchored by Watson who ran the ball 25 times for 108 rushing yards. The Monarchs got 162 of their yards on the ground and only 149 through the air.

QUOTABLES

Head coach Skip Holtz

“With a young quarterback and playing on the road we were trying to play for the win. Unfortunately we were not able to execute it. I thought defensively we did some really good things. We had some big stops had two turnovers. This is the fourth last play of the game loss of the season. We are going to have to get over it. We are going to have to pick ourselves up. We have four more games.”

NOTABLES

• With the loss Old Dominion now leads the all-time series 2-0. Both losses by LA Tech have come by three points to ODU.

• This marked the sixth time (out of eight) this season that the game was decided by one possession. LA Tech is 2-4 in those games.

• Austin Kendall eclipsed 20 completions for the fifth time this season.

• Smoke Harris tied his season-high with seven completions. The wide receiver has recorded at least six catches in five of his last six games.

• Marcus Williams Jr. tallied his third rushing touchdown of the season.

• Trey Baldwin and Tyler Grubbs tied for the team-high in tackles with 11 apiece. For Baldwin it was the third time in the last four games he has recorded 10+ tackles. For Grubbs it was the second time this season with 10+.

• The LA Tech defense forced two turnovers – a fumble and recovery by Khalil Ladler (both firsts of his Bulldog career) and an interception by Kody Fulp (first of his career).

GlobalFoundries campus in Malta N.Y. Mary Thompson | CNBC

Semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries debuted on the Nasdaq this week valued at over $25 billion as it became increasingly evident that a global chip shortage could persist through 2023 or later. Now GlobalFoundries needs to convince public market investors that the company is riding a wave of increased demand for all sorts of microchips that won't fizzle out after pandemic-related supply issues abate and that it can increase profitability even as it spends billions on a capital intensive business.

""I think for the better part of the next five to 10 years we're going to be chasing supply not demand"" GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield said in an interview with CNBC. GlobalFoundries' clients include Qualcomm  MediaTek  NXP Semiconductors and Qorvo . Automotive companies and home appliance makers have been struggling for months to obtain enough chips for building products and now the problem is spreading to electronics manufacturers and their suppliers. Apple for example said it will miss out on more than $6 billion in sales this holiday season because of chip shortages. Intel likewise blamed its lower CPU sales on shortages in power supply and networking chips. But the shortages aren't for the most advanced chips that use the latest manufacturing methods. Instead the shortages are for what are often called ""legacy nodes"" or semiconductors that use older technology to perform functions like power management connecting to displays or enabling wireless connections. Those are the kinds of chips that GlobalFoundries a third-party silicon-wafer foundry specializes in manufacturing for its clients Caulfield explained.

The company is also investing in a new facility in the Shanghai Lin-Gang area a semiconductor industry cluster designated by the city government.

Semiconductor production is a priority in China’s latest five-year plan as the world’s second-largest economy braces for a heightened tech war with the US. China’s output of integrated circuits (ICs) reached a monthly record in July on the back of strong demand and the addition of new production capacity.

Established just over two decades ago in Shanghai Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) is considered the country’s national champion in producing chips used in various electronics products from smartphones and computers to cars and mobile base stations.

Tapping experienced semiconductor talent from Taiwan the mainland Chinese chip foundry has been able quickly move up the technology ladder since it was established.

However SMIC’s ability to close the technology gap with chip foundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) has been stymied by US trade sanctions  imposed because of its alleged ties to the Chinese military – a charge the firm denies. As a result SMIC is focusing on mature technology nodes – which are now in high demand due to the increased use of chips in a wide range of consumer applications.

Here is all you need to know about China’s chip champion SMIC and how it is leading Beijing’s drive for semiconductor self-sufficiency.

What is SMIC and what are its connections to Taiwan?

SMIC was established in April 2000 by Richard Chang Rugin who made a career of building new wafer fabs during two decades at US chip maker Texas Instruments.

Many of SMIC’s engineers as well as key senior managers were recruited from Taiwan with TSMC being a primary target for talent.

Chang stepped down as CEO of SMIC in November 2009 three days after the company settled a years-long lawsuit with TSMC which had sued Chang’s company for alleged theft of intellectual property by hiring former TSMC employees.

Since 2017 SMIC has operated a shared senior management arrangement with Zhao Haijun and Liang Mong Song appointed co-CEOs in October of that year.

Zhao joined the company in October 2010 with 28 years of experience in the industry while Liang came to SMIC with 35 years of experience including senior positions in research and development at TSMC until 2009.

Another ex-TSMC executive was hired by SMIC in December 2020. Chiang Shang-yi was appointed vice-chairman after a 40-year career in the semiconductor industry including as head of the TSMC R&D team.

SMIC’s co-CEOs reportedly have different agendas. Liang backed an aggressive leading-edge strategy for SMIC which put him at odds with Zhao who preferred to develop commercially viable products using older technology according to a report by the Financial Times last year.

How does SMIC fit into China’s self-sufficiency ambitions?

As China’s biggest and most advanced chip maker SMIC is considered the country’s national champion in Beijing’s drive to establish self-sufficiency in semiconductors amid the US-China tech war.

Chip production is a priority in China’s latest five-year plan as the country braces for a heightened tech war with the US. China’s output of integrated circuits (ICs) rose more than 41 per cent year on year to 31.6 billion units in July a monthly record on the back of strong demand and the addition of new production capacity.

will cover a land area equal to about five football fields and mainly produce display driver and power management chips using mature technologies according to a document published by the government of Shenzhen’s Pingshan district. SMIC’s new Beijing plant with a total investment of nearly 50 billion yuan (US$7.7 billion) is expected to start operations in 2024 with monthly production capacity of 100000 12-inch silicon wafers. Its new Shenzhen plant meanwhile

SMIC derives more than half its wafer revenues from mainland China and Hong Kong while smartphone chips are its biggest market accounting for 44.4 per cent of wafer revenue last year.

SMIC generates the bulk of its sales from mature technology nodes which accounted for 37.5 per cent of its total in the first quarter of 2021.

How has SMIC been affected by the US-China tech war?

In October 2020 the US Department of Commerce designated SMIC as a “military end user” restricting it from using US technologies.

Then in December that year SMIC was added to the Entity List on the grounds of US national security and foreign policy interests. This further restricted the company from purchasing US chip manufacturing equipment requiring a licence to be issued before shipments can be made.

The US Commerce Department has said it will apply a “presumption of denial” for products required to produce chips at the 10-nanometre and below node. The restriction will hinder SMIC’s ability to import extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanners sold by Dutch company ASML.

In its fourth quarter results released in February  SMIC reported that its share of wafer revenue from advanced 14-nm and 28-nm processing nodes fell by a large margin from the earlier July-September quarter due to the loss of a “big customer” – believed to be Huawei Technologies Co which is also subject to US trade sanctions.

What is it doing to cope with US sanctions?

US trade restrictions imposed on SMIC for its alleged links to the Chinese military – a charge it denies – continue to cloud its prospects for moving up the technology ladder although recent export licence approvals show that the Chinese company has not been completely cut off from US technology.

From November 2020 to April 2021 suppliers to SMIC received 188 licences worth US$42 billion to sell products to the Chinese foundry according to a recent Reuters report citing documents obtained from the US Congress.

In March SMIC secured supplies of deep ultraviolet lithography systems from Dutch firm ASML in an amended purchase agreement worth US$1.2 billion which could help ensure the Chinese firm’s capacity expansion for more mature nodes.

Company vice-chairman Chiang Shang-yi believes SMIC should focus on developing advanced packaging technologies that can cram more circuits into smaller packages to overcome its weakness in nanometre process nodes.

In chip packaging SMIC has previously invested in specialist companies in this field. It holds 12.86 per cent equity in China’s JCET Group the third largest IC packaging and testing company after ASE of Taiwan and Amkor of South Korea.

Will SMIC ever be a world leader in making chips?

SMIC ranks No 5 among the top 10 foundries with a market share of 5 per cent behind TSMC Samsung Electronics United Microelectrnics Corp and GlobalFoundries according to Taiwan-based market research firm TrendForce (see chart).

Source: TrendForce and public documents

However with first quarter revenue of just over US$1 billion SMIC is dwarfed by No 1 player TSMC which reported first-quarter revenue of US$12.9 billion.

SMIC’s lack of access to EUV technology will mean it cannot produce more advanced chips hindering its attempts to catch up to TSMC in terms of technology development. However mature technology nodes from 350-nm to 28-nm are what most Chinese semiconductor design companies need especially those designing chips for Internet of Things and car applications.

All three of the new fabs that SMIC is building in Beijing Shanghai and Shenzhen are focused on the mature 28-nm technology node.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC9ib3NjaC13aWxsLWludmVzdC00NjItbWlsbGlvbi1pbi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctaW4tMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bosch Will Invest $462 Million In Semiconductor Manufacturing In 2022,"Bosch announced that it will invest €400 million ($462.5 million) in three semiconductor production sites next year. The majority of the investment will go into its production facility in Dresden Germany which commenced operations in June.

“Demand for chips is continuing to grow at breakneck speed. In light of current developments we are systematically expanding our semiconductor production so we can provide our customers with the best possible support” said Dr. Volkmar Denner chairman of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH.

According to Reuters along with the Dresden facility Bosch plans to invest €50 million ($58 million) in creating additional cleanroom space at its Reutlingen plant in Germany. With that decision Bosch will have invested a total of €150 million ($173 million) at the site between 2021 and 2023.

“Our aim is to ramp up production of chips in Dresden earlier than planned and at the same time expand clean-room capacity in Reutlingen. Every additional chip we produce will help in the current situation” said Harald Kroeger member of Bosch‘s board of management.

Bosch will also build a new center in Penang Malaysia to test finished semiconductors. The company expects the center to be able to perform testing of chips and sensors starting in 2023. Initially covering an area of 14000 square meters (150695 square feet) it will provide clean rooms office space R&D and training facilities for up to 400 employees.

Bosch has been producing semi-conductors since 1970 and today the chips are used in consumer electronics and automobiles. The automotive sector has been particularly affected by the supply disruption with many chipmakers opting to switch their production to consumer electronics during the pandemic.

With shortages set to last into 2022 any additional production is doubtless welcome news for automakers that are losing money. Estimates suggest that the automotive industry as a whole could lose $210 billion this year as a result of the shortage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWljaGFlbHRheWxvci8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL2Jvc2NoLXRvLXNwZW5kLTQwMC1taWxsaW9uLWluLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItZmFjdG9yaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bosch To Spend €400 Million In Semiconductor Factories,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2021/10/31/bosch-to-spend-400-million-in-semiconductor-factories/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWljaGFlbHRheWxvci8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL2Jvc2NoLXRvLXNwZW5kLTQwMC1taWxsaW9uLWluLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItZmFjdG9yaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Based on extensive research and nearly 100 interviews the report examines California’s economic footprint in Israel Israel’s economic presence in California key technologies where that activity is focused and future opportunities for collaboration.

Built on shared values and aligned interests the relationship between California’s Silicon Valley and Israel’s Silicon Wadi is reflected in growing venture investment large-scale acquisitions of Israeli companies successful Israeli-founded unicorns and public companies in Silicon Valley and extensive corporate and binational R&D.

“Drawn by the search for engineering talent Silicon Valley companies began their migration to Israel in the mid-1970s a movement that has continued to the point where today California R&D centers are pervasive” the report states. “Silicon Valley’s footprint can be seen most deeply in its concentrated investment in software and IT services.

More highlights of the report:

• From January 2003 to February 2021 California companies made 147 foreign direct investment projects in Israel. Software and IT services was the leading field followed by semiconductors financial services and communications.

• 103 California companies invested a total of $22.4 billion in Israeli companies between 2003 and 2021.

• California-based companies are responsible for 20 percent of all acquisitions of Israeli companies globally and for 42% of all acquisitions by US-based companies.

• Out of 402 multinational companies with an innovation presence in Israel 96 are California headquartered and 80 of those are from the Bay Area.

• California hosts 140 Israeli-owned firms that support 6248 jobs amounting to $615 million in wages.

• California is home to 22 Israeli-founded technology unicorns the most of any US state.

• Three of the five largest Israeli acquisitions in history and seven of the top 15 acquisitions were made by California companies including Mobileye and Moovit by Intel Mellanox by NVIDIA and Waze by Google.

Silicon Valley-headquartered firms such as Applied Materials KLA Corporation IBM Oracle Cisco Salesforce and Intel exemplify the role that Israel plays in the global R&D and business strategy of multinational companies.

“Intel with 14000 employees is both Israel’s largest technology company and its largest private employer” the report states.

Looking toward the future the report pinpoints promising fields for future cooperation as biotech data science and security particularly advanced cryptographic systems such as postquantum cryptography.

“Embedding intelligence at the edges of computing — through intelligent vehicles and highway systems for example — is creating new security vulnerabilities. With more intelligence in the grid there is a growing question of how to secure it and with the world at an inflection point between data-enabled connectivity and systemic vulnerability a rich opportunity exists for collaboration with Israel in fields such as AI and cybersecurity” the report predicts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNDQ4NTU5L2F2aWF0aW9uLXNvZnR3YXJlLW1hcmtldC1pcy1saWtlbHktdG8tZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1hLXRyZW1lbmRvdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aviation Software Market is Likely to Experience a Tremendous Growth in Near Future,"Aviation Software Market is Likely to Experience a Tremendous Growth in Near Future | Swiss Aviation Software HCL Technologies IBM

Since I began writing my column for Puck I’ve been inundated with feedback about Wall Street’s biggest characters and concerns. I’ll be engaging with some of those questions here—in addition to a few observations of my own.

DWAC the blank-check vessel for Donald Trump’s nonexistent media venture has tumbled from its meme-stock highs to settle at about $70 a share still more than a 570% return for early investors.

But first before the boys and Lisa got the call to spin up there was much personal drama to navigate. Clay and Stella were grabbing a coffee and planning their baby announcement strategy (sorry Mark Zuckerberg!) when who walks by but Ash whom Clay hasn’t heard from in about two years (since their faltered father/son TBI issue team-up). After Clay and Stella share their months-old wedding news Ash spots the sonogram photo on the cafe table. Ash talks of teaching the grandkid how to fish and such when Clay cuts him off mocking his sudden interest in family. When Ash slinks away (and after Stella calls out her husband on his rudeness) Clay catches up to his dad and notices a blood splotch on his shirt suggesting he has a chemo port — but Ash won’t say anything about his cancer.

Elsewhere Jason kept Emma’s boyfriend Brad on his toes then just as he got the call spin up they shared with him their plan to live together. Jason laughs out loud at the prospect then at least lays out some terms — after Emma graduates and after Brad finds a job. Brad says he has just enlisted with the Navy (with designs on becoming a SEAL!) and on that note Jason shuts down the conversation until he gets back. Meanwhile at the Bulkhead Lisa grabs a lunch/bats around thesis ideas with handsome Grant who’s in the DoD fellowship with her when Sonny (fresh off being chastised by Hannah for helicopter parenting) spots them from the bar. Just then the news breaks about a series of terrorist attacks on tourist spots in West Africa.

Onto the the mission at hand…. A group dubbed SGS and described as “latter-day Isis disciples” has supplanted Boko Haram as the most powerful terrorist force in the West African region Blackburn and Davis report and they are behind the attacks that left more than a hundred dead. With the Pentagon demanding “emphatic action” Bravo leaves to make camp in Burkina Faso — though when they get there it’s clear that the CIA at least has been in town for a good while ahead of the attacks.

Bravo’s CIA liaison Carl Dryden is tight-lipped and even keeps Lisa on her toes. At first Bravo is tasked with targeting a total of three HVTs in two neighboring safe houses at night though just as they are about to kick some doors Dryden tells Davis to order Bravo to stand down. A puzzled and frustrated Bravo returns to camp where Dryden eventually shares the latest intel and a comparatively audacious plan to target the HVTs in broad daylight before they board planes leaving a small airstrip near a petroleum plant. Though not without their reservations Jason and Ray (who is acting as OIC with Soto deployed elsewhere) agree to the plan.

Sure enough just as they are pulling up near the airstrip the next morning Bravo finds themselves under fire. They quickly pull over and enter the plant on foot where they gun down several tangos — including two of the HVTs. When they then get pinned down by a machine gun nest Trent takes it out with some sort of grenade. Bravo then breathes easier and gets to gathering/relaying intel from the terrorist command center they found inside the petroleum plant. Lisa and her analysts learn that the last HVT is planning to board a train to suicide-bomb the U.S. consulate during his travels. But just as Bravo is clearing out of the SGS command center one photo of many taped to a wall catches Jason’s eye — it’s of Mandy who clearly is/was being held prisoner by SGS. Seeing what Jason sees Ray nudges Bravo 1 to stay on mission though Jason obviously will want to do whatever they can to find and save their friend.

Indra Nooyi the former CEO of PepsiCo may have headed a multi-billion dollar corporation but when it came to managing her household she was told to “leave her crown outside” by her mother.

Sharing an anecdote Nooyi in a 2017 LinkedIn post recalled how she realised the importance of work-life balance when was reminded by her mother of the same.

The incident is from the day when Nooyi was informed by the CEO of PepsiCo that she would be the president of the Fortune 500 company and would also be appointed to the board of directors. Bubbling with the newfound knowledge of her success she left for home “early” only to be told by her mother to get some milk before she could break the news to her family members.

“I’ll never forget coming home after being named President of PepsiCo back in 2001. My mother was visiting at the time. “I’ve got great news for you” I shouted. She replied “It can wait. We need you to go out and get some milk.” So I go out and get milk. And when I come back I’m hopping mad. I say “I had great news for you. I’ve just been named President of PepsiCo. And all you want me to do is go out and get milk.” Then she says “Let me explain something to you. You may be the President of PepsiCo. But when you step into this house you’re a wife and mother first. Nobody can take that place. So leave that crown in the garage” Nooyi recalled in her post.

“She was right of course. No matter who we are or what we do nobody can take our place in our families. Now I’ll admit I’ve found it’s rarely possible to be the kind of mother wife employee and person you want to be – all at the same time. Often you need to make a choice and that’s especially true if you want to be CEO. There’s no way around it.”

Nooyi stepped down as the CEO of PepsiCo in 2018 after helming the company for almost a decade. The company increased its revenue by 80% during her revenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXRpb25vZmNoYW5nZS5vcmcvMjAyMS8xMC8zMC9uZXctcmVwb3J0LXJhbmtzLTE3LW1ham9yLXVzLWZvb2QtbWFudWZhY3R1cmVycy1vbi10aGVpci1hY3Rpb25zLXRvLXJlZHVjZS1ncm93aW5nLXJpc2stb2YtcGVzdGljaWRlLXVzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New report ranks 17 major US food manufacturers on their actions to reduce growing risk of pesticide use,"The report was conducted by As You Sow and found General Mills Lamb Weston Del Monte and PepsiCo to score the highest when it came their actions to reduce the growing risk of pesticide use.

As scientific research continues to connect pesticide exposures to harmful human health effects a new report ranked the efforts of 17 major U.S. food manufacturers to reduce pesticides in agriculture. The report was conducted by As You Sow and found General Mills Lamb Weston Del Monte and PepsiCo to score the highest when it came their actions to reduce the growing risk of pesticide use.

The report Pesticides in the Pantry: Transparency & Risk in Food Supply Chains ranked 17 major U.S. food manufacturers “based on their performance on 28 indicators designed to measure how effectively companies are reducing pesticide risk and improving agricultural resiliency.” Out of 27 possible points General Mills (16 points) Lamb Weston (15) Del Monte (14) and PepsiCo (14) scored the highest while Post and B&G Foods scored the lowest (0 points each) followed by J.M. Smucker (1 point).

“Investors expect companies to be planning for the future and preparing for the effects of climate change” Danielle Fugere As You Sow’s president and a contributor to the report said. “For food companies climate resilience requires investing in agricultural systems that restore ecosystems and soil health and dramatically reduce the use of toxic chemicals.”

While there are “new initiatives that aim to transition land to regenerative farming practices that are better for the environment farmers and consumers” this report confirms that “these efforts could be thwarted by continued use of pesticides as companies for the most part continue to ignore this important component of risk and resiliency.”

The harmful health effects of pesticide exposure includes cancer cardiovascular disease birth and developmental defects liver and kidney disease and obesity according to scientific research. And pesticide-based agriculture is harmful to the environment as studies demonstrate it causes loss of critical pollinator species reduced biodiversity and toxins in waterways.

Several companies made new commitments to reduce pesticide risk according to the report which is an improvement compared to 2019. But “problematically companies continue to avoid addressing and accounting for pesticide use as a meaningful component of promoting agricultural resiliency” according to the report. Therefore As You Sow offers “alternative solutions to support farmers in transitioning away from chemical-dependent farming systems” such as certified organic farming integrated pest management and regenerative agriculture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vYXVyb3JhLmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTE0NDI1MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Showcasing Pakistan's Hidden Treasures at Expo 2020 Dubai,"The spectacular Pakistan Pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai has been receiving global attention for promoting Pakistan as a leading destination and demonstrating the country’s immense potential through an immersive and visually captivating experience for millions of visitors from around the world.

Lucasti was an integral part of a clinical trial and the effort to develop the Pfizer vaccine.

Lucasti began working in clinical trials just out of medical school when the need was critical to find treatments for HIV. He has continued with that mission and his practice has been involved with more than 100 clinical trials for antibiotics and other medications over the last 25 years helping to bring treatment and cures to patients who need them.

Initially HIV positive patients were not permitted in the vaccine trial but after two months Lucasti said HIV patients who were on treatment and whose viral load was undetectable were permitted to take part in the clinical trial.

Because of his success with previous clinical trials Pfizer reached out to Lucasti to be part of their clinical trial for the mRNA vaccine.

“We were the only Pfizer COVID-19 clinical testing site in the Philadelphia area and only one of two in New Jersey” Lucasti said.

In August and September 2020 Lucasti enrolled 150 patients in the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine study. The participants had to meet certain criteria before being considered for the vaccine according to Lucasti. They could not have already had COVID-19 nor could the participants have any disease that could suppress their immune system. Lucasti said a number of the volunteer trial participants included surgeons and physicians at Shore Medical Center eager to help find a successful vaccine to combat the virus.

Lucasti said the clinical trial was a “blind” study and the 150 participants did not know if they received a placebo or the actual Pfizer vaccine. Participants were monitored after receiving the vaccine for reactions. Once the study was complete and the emergency use authorization was permitted by the Federal Drug Administration the study conducted was “unblinded.”

“The people in the study wanted to know if they had gotten a shot of the actual COVID-19 vaccine and those that received the placebo were given the opportunity to get the true vaccine” he said.

Lucasti said he and his staff have been involved with clinical trials on about 90% of the antibiotics that have been released in the past two decades.

“We work with the pharmaceutical companies and we enroll patients that we feel have a chance to benefit from a new medication to treat their disease or infection.”

As an infectious disease physician Lucasti said he loves what he does.

“In my field we have the opportunity to cure patients. In many fields the doctor can help a patient manage their disease very successfully but my hope is that if you come to me with an infection and after treatment their problem is resolved and cured. They leave and go on with their lives and that is something that is very special to me. Maybe I will never see them again and that is a good thing. They are cured and curing patients has always been my goal.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YW1wYWJheS5jb20vbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMS8xMC8zMC9zZXZlbi1zcG9va3ktdGhpbmdzLXBlb3BsZS1zYXktYXJlLWluLXRoZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5lcy1idXQtZGVmaW5pdGVseS1hcmVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seven spooky things people say are in the COVID-19 vaccines but definitely aren't,"Just in time for Halloween claims about what’s lurking in the COVID-19 vaccines are getting wilder and spookier.

There’s the “transhumanism nanotechnology” ingredient that will apparently turn all of us into copies of the Terminator. There’s also “graphene oxide” a material that some claimed will straight up kill you. Why didn’t Michael Myers think of that?

Rest assured we’ve fact-checked this and it’s all fake gore.

Here’s a look at seven scary things that are not in the vaccines and as a treat a list of the rather helpful things that are.

1. Aluminum that “will kill” the brain.

Aluminum. They use it in pickup trucks food containers and antiperspirants. But in the COVID-19 vaccines? No.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that small amounts of aluminum — specifically aluminum salts — have been used in vaccines since the 1930s as an adjuvant which helps elicit a stronger immune response from the body.

But none of the three COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the U.S. — Pfizer Moderna and Johnson & Johnson all of which have publicly accessible ingredient lists — contain any aluminum.

As for other vaccines research has shown their levels of aluminum are so low that they can’t easily be absorbed by the body let alone the brain. There has been no evidence of the aluminum in vaccines causing illness or developmental disorders.

2. Nanoparticles that will help people “locate you” via 5G networks.

While your cell phone can help Big Brother or your mother locate you via 5G networks the vaccines cannot.

Yet some social media users likened the bubbles of fat in the vaccine to the sort of tracking microchips implanted under a pet’s skin. That’s a lot of creepy nonsense.

There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines contain technology similar to pet microchips. The lipid nanoparticles used in some of the vaccines are called “nanoparticles” because they are very very small. They have nothing to do with 5G networks or tracking technology.

3. “RNA-modifying transhumanism nanotechnology.”

This baseless conspiracy theory says that the shots include a technology that changes “what it is to be human.” The vaccines don’t contain any such thing.

“None of the vaccines contain nanotechnology of any sort let alone ‘transhumanism nanotechnology’ which isn’t even a thing” Mark Lynas a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science and Cornell University told PolitiFact.

“RNA” and the prefix “nano” are valid scientific terms though. Here’s what they mean:“RNA” — ribonucleic acid — is a molecule that carries coded genetic information to a cell and a messenger form of RNA is used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to send information about the coronavirus to the body’s cells to teach the immune system to identify and prepare to fight off a COVID-19 infection. (Spoiler alert: It does not modify a person’s DNA or RNA.) The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a disabled adenovirus to deliver instructions to do the same.

“Nano” as we said earlier is a term widely used to describe things that are very tiny and scientists use the prefix more specifically to refer to things on the scale of individual atoms.

4. A “Trypanosoma Parasite” that is one of the causes of AIDS

A chilling grainy black-and-white image being shared on social media has been described as a “Trypanosoma Parasite” purportedly observed in Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. Several variants of the parasite internet users claimed are lethal and are one of many causes of acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS.

This is erroneous on all counts.

Dr. Bobbi Pritt the director of clinical parasitology at the Mayo Clinic told us the blurry image likely represents an out-of-focus non-cellular component of the vaccine and doesn’t show a Trypanosoma cruzi or any other parasite.

As for the claim that this particular parasite causes AIDS that’s also wrong she said.

“The only thing that causes AIDS is an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus” she said “and this cannot be acquired through the Pfizer vaccine.”

5. Living microorganisms that can “germinate to cause sickness” with “all sorts of uncontrollable byproducts.”

A popular video claimed that the Pfizer vaccine contains “particles that could germinate and cause illness” — and that vitamin supplements could stop this from happening. You can bet someone is selling those supplements online.

There’s no truth to this one either. The ingredients for Pfizer vaccines are chemical components — not living organisms.

“Contamination with spores or other microbial material can theoretically happen during production of any biologic including vaccines” said Volker Mai associate professor in the epidemiology department at the University of Florida. “However quality control is extensive and monitoring occurs continuously. Thus it is highly unlikely that any contaminated batch would make it into the market.”

6. Something that makes magnets stick to you

A vaccine turning you into the Marvel villain Magneto? That sounds terrifying (unless that’s what you wanted.) But don’t worry the COVID-19 vaccines won’t make you more attractive to magnets.

Social media users have shared videos that appear to show magnets sticking to people’s arms where they say they were injected and claimed this as proof the shots have microchips in them.

But medical experts called the claim utter nonsense.

Al Edwards an associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading in England told Newsweek that because vaccine’s ingredients are some of the same things that are in the human body “there is simply no way that injecting a tiny fragment of this material” could make it respond to a magnet. “Most food is made of similar molecules and eating food doesn’t make people magnetic” he said.

A similar claim cites a video showing what looks like small balls connecting and growing on their own. The disturbing clip was described as the COVID-19 vaccine’s reaction once it hits the bloodstream.

That’s wrong. The video was actually from a 2015 science experiment by the Stanford Complexity Group an initiative to bring complexity science to a wider audience that shows self-organizing wires which is still weird.

One more time for the people in the back: None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips or metals.

7. “Graphene oxide” which is “toxic to the human body and causes a number of problems.”

An incendiary video that speaks of murder claims that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is dangerously packed with something called graphene oxide.

A Pfizer spokesperson told PolitiFact that while graphene oxide — a material made by the oxidation of graphite — is used in some vaccines it is not used at Pfizer and is not in its COVID-19 vaccine. None of the listed ingredients is another name for graphene oxide and the material doesn’t appear in ingredient lists for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

The real not so spooky ingredients

The real ingredients are much less likely to keep you up at night.

All three manufacturers of the approved vaccines in the U.S. Pfizer Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have shared their ingredients.

For Moderna and Pfizer the active ingredient is messenger RNA which carries genetic information about the coronavirus to the body’s cells to help them recognize and produce antibodies against it. There’s no evidence that mRNA is dangerous and scientists say the material is broken down by the body within days.

Pfizer’s inactive ingredients include lipids salts sugar and saline solution.

The lipids encase the mRNA the salts help keep the pH or acidity of the vaccine close to that of a person’s body; and the sugar safeguards the lipids when they’re frozen and stops them from sticking together according to MIT’s Technology Review which spoke with experts to help decode the contents.

Before injection the vaccine is mixed with the saline solution just as many intravenously delivered medicines are the report said.

Moderna’s ingredient list is very similar and includes the lipids salts and sugar with a slight difference including the solution for the injection that may explain the different storage needs for each.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a disabled adenovirus rather than mRNA to deliver instructions to produce the coronavirus’ spike proteins and activate the immune system. The other ingredients are alcohol citric acid salts and sugars.

A full list of ingredients for all the vaccines is available on the CDC website.

CAIRO - 30 October 2021: Acting Health Ministry Khaled Abdel Ghafar said on Saturday that Egypt received the fourth shipment of Pfizer coronavirus vaccine at Cairo airport comprising 3 million and 634 thousands doses offered by the US government through the COVAX initiative in cooperation with Gavi the vaccine alliance.

He pointed out that the total doses of the ""Pfizer"" vaccine that Egypt has received so far has reached 8255520 doses.

The vaccine shipment will undergo safety testing before being distributed among vaccination centers nationwide according to him.

Egypt's first Pfizer vaccines shipment arrived from the US in late September.



Spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Population Dr Khaled Megahed said the World Health Organization (WHO) had approved an emergency use for the two- shot Pfizer vaccine.

The FDA cleared kid-size doses — just a third of the amount given to teens and adults — for emergency use and up to 28 million more American children could be eligible for vaccinations as early as next week.

One more regulatory hurdle remains: On Tuesday advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make more detailed recommendations on which youngsters should get vaccinated with a final decision by the agency's director expected shortly afterwards.

""Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy"" Dr Janet Woodcock the acting FDA commissioner said in a statement. ""Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine's safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.""

A few countries have begun using other COVID-19 vaccines in children under 12 including China which just began vaccinations for three-year-olds. But many that use the vaccine made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are watching the US decision and European regulators just began considering the companies' kid-size doses.

With FDA's action Pfizer plans to begin shipping millions of vials of the paediatric vaccine — in orange caps to avoid mix-ups with the purple-capped doses for everyone else — to doctors' offices pharmacies and other vaccination sites. Once the CDC issues its ruling eligible kids will get two shots three weeks apart.

While children are at lower risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 than older people 5- to 11-year-olds still have been seriously affected — including over 8300 hospitalisations about a third requiring intensive care and nearly 100 deaths since the start of the coronavirus pandemic according to the FDA. And with the extra-contagious delta variant circulating the government has counted more than 2000 coronavirus-related school closings just since the start of the school year affecting more than a million children.

""With this vaccine kids can go back to something that's better than being locked at home on remote schooling not being able to see their friends"" said Dr. Kawsar Talaat of Johns Hopkins University. ""The vaccine will protect them and also protect our communities.""

Earlier this week FDA's independent scientific advisers voted that the pediatric vaccine's promised benefits outweigh any risks. But several panelists said not all youngsters will need to be vaccinated and that they preferred the shots be targeted to those at higher risk from the virus.

Nearly 70 per cent of 5- to 11-year-olds hospitalised for COVID-19 in the US have other serious medical conditions including asthma and obesity according to federal tracking. Additionally more than two-thirds of youngsters hospitalised are Black or Hispanic mirroring long-standing disparities in the disease's impact.

The question of how broadly Pfizer's vaccine should be used will be a key consideration for the CDC and its advisers who set formal recommendations for paediatricians and other medical professionals.

A Pfizer study of 2268 schoolchildren found the vaccine was nearly 91 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections based on 16 cases of COVID-19 among kids given dummy shots compared to just three who got vaccinated.

The kid dosage also proved safe with similar or fewer temporary reactions — such as sore arms fever or achiness — that teens experience.

But the study wasn't large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second full-strength dose mostly in young men and teen boys. It's unclear if younger children getting a smaller dose also will face that rare risk.

Some parents are expected to vaccinate their children ahead of family holiday gatherings and the winter cold season.

But a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey suggests most parents won't rush to get the shots. About 25 per cent of parents polled earlier this month said they would get their children vaccinated ""right away."" But the remaining majority of parents were roughly split between those who said they will to wait to see how the vaccine performs and those who said they ""definitely"" won't have their children vaccinated.

The similarly made Moderna vaccine also is being studied in young children and both Pfizer and Moderna also are testing shots for babies and preschoolers.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Sittenfeld case get it wrong? Ex-councilman hopes appeals court frees him from prison,"CINCINNATI — Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld asked a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out his public corruption conviction at a hearing on Thursday.

Once a rising political star and favorite to be Cincinnati mayor Sittenfeld is now serving a 16-month sentence for bribery and attempted extortion.

But Sittenfeld is looking for freedom and exoneration.

“I think this was a good day for Sittenfeld. I think the judges’ questions went much tougher on the prosecutor than on Sittenfeld’s lawyers” said Ken Katkin a Northern Kentucky University law professor who attended the 2022 trial and Thursday’s oral arguments at the appeals court.

Sittenfeld has maintained that he did nothing illegal by accepting $20000 in campaign donations from undercover FBI agents who were posing as developers and championing their project to redevelop a blighted downtown property into a boutique hotel because he was a pro-development politician.

It is extremely rare for an appeals court to overturn a jury’s verdict in a criminal case; it only happens 10% of the time said Katkin who gave Sittenfeld a much higher chance of winning on appeal.

More than 75 people attended Thursday's hearing mostly Sittenfeld’s friends family and political supporters. Once every seat in the large courtroom had been filled a court official directed the standing spectators to an overflow room where they could listen to the hearing.

Oral arguments are usually slated for 30 minutes. But the three-judge panel of appointees of former President Donald Trump asked repeated questions that pushed the hearing to 40 minutes. The judges were John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy.

Sittenfeld’s attorney Yaakov Roth warned of the widespread implications on political fundraising if the appeals court let this conviction stand. Roth a partner at the Washington D.C. law firm of Jones Day helped to vindicate former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell from corruption charges.

“There is a real danger of exposing every elected official in the nation to potential prosecution” said Roth who argued the government is illegally expanding corruption laws by targeting routine political behavior as somehow criminal.

But Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Singer who prosecuted Sittenfeld during a three-week trial with colleagues Emily Glatfelter and Megan Gaffney Painter reminded the court that the jury’s verdict must be respected.

“The jury does not assess any piece of evidence standing alone the jury assesses all of the evidence in the full context and … the jury found Mr. Sittenfeld’s testimony not credible” Singer said.

The jury rejected Sittenfeld’s explanations from the witness stand about his intent behind some very controversial recorded conversations that prosecutors used to convict him.

Lawyers on both sides focused on an October 2018 recorded call between Sittenfeld and Chinedum Ndukwe who was cooperating with the FBI. Sittenfeld who wanted to run for mayor asked for campaign donations in the form of “rounding up LLCs” from Ndukwe a former Cincinnati Bengal turned real estate developer: Sittenfeld can be heard saying “You don’t want me to be like hey Chin love you but can’t.”

""Honestly I can ... I can sit here and say I can deliver the votes"" Sittenfeld told the undercover agent who is known as Rob during a November 2018 meeting at a downtown condo.

Former prosecutor and ex-city councilman Steve Goodin said an appeals court isn't likely to contradict a jury’s findings.

“There is a jury who found there is actually an express deal to sell his vote. That is his biggest problem” Goodin said.

But Sittenfeld’s case despite its local nature has captured the national spotlight especially among legal conservatives. Former attorneys general White House counsels law professors and former prosecutors filed amicus briefs on behalf of Sittenfeld and in opposition to criminalizing political fundraising.

“All of them were arguing … these were all lawful campaign contributions that were properly recorded to the Federal Election Commission properly disclosed and not diverted these funds were not spent on anything improper either” Katkin said. “These kinds of prosecutions are extremely unusual bordering on almost never happening where no money is diverted into a candidate’s pocket.”

The three judges asked repeated questions about the standard for sufficiency of evidence yet seemed skeptical about throwing out the jury's verdict. They also picked up on technical issues at the trial such as amending the indictment and instructions to the jury.

“This issue of informal amending of an indictment ... what they’re really asking is did the prosecutors and the judge invite the jury to convict based on Sittenfeld’s conversation with Chin Ndukwe even though he was only charged with taking a bribe from the developers not Chin Ndukwe"" Katkin said.

At the end of the hearing Roth asked the judges to consider suspending the remainder of Sittenfeld’s sentence and releasing him from prison while the appeal was pending.

If that happened Katkin said Sittenfeld could be released this week. But the final appeals court decision may not come for three months.

Sittenfeld was the third council member the FBI arrested in 2020 on public corruption charges stemming from a massive sting at Cincinnati City Hall involving at least three undercover FBI agents and multiple informants who secretly recorded numerous elected leaders over two years.

Former council member Tamaya Dennard pleaded guilty to honest services wire fraud for accepting $15000 as part of a scheme to exchange her votes for money. A judge sentenced her to 18 months in prison and she was released in 2022.

Former council member Jeff Pastor also pleaded guilty to honest services wire fraud. Prosecutors said he took $55000 in bribes in exchange for votes on development deals.

Pastor is serving his two-year sentence at the same federal prison as Sittenfeld who was his former colleague at City Hall. Both are at the minimum-security prison and camp at Ashland in Eastern Kentucky.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaW9ucHJvZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvcGl0dHNidXJnaC1uZXdzLXN0cmlrZS1sZWFkZXItcmVhY3RzLXRvLXBnLWNvLW93bmVycy1sYXdzdWl0LXZzLWhpcy1mYW1pbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pittsburgh news strike leader reacts to PG co-owner's family lawsuit,"Workers from four unions are continuing their unfair labor practice strike at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette despite the news that one of the PG’s owners has filed suit against his twin brother and other family members in part because they explored selling the newspaper.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9maW5hbmNlLzIwMjQvZmlubGV0ZS1vZmZlcnMtcGctdmVyc2lvbi1vZi1vbmx5ZmFucy10aHJvdWdoLWF0aGxldGUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLTEyMzQ3NzgyNTUv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvMjAyNC9maW5sZXRlLW9mZmVycy1wZy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLW9ubHlmYW5zLXRocm91Z2gtYXRobGV0ZS1pbnZlc3RpbmctMTIzNDc3ODI1NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finlete Offers ‘PG Version of OnlyFans’ as Pro Investing Grows,"Rob Connolly’s first athlete-related start-up was Meetlete a sports-star version of Cameo. Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbG91ZGhvdXNlLmNvbS9wb3N0cy9zeXJhY3VzZS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLTQtc3Rhci1wZy10eWxlci1qYWNrc29uLXNheXMtaGUtdGFsa3MtdG8tb3JhbmdlLWV2ZXJ5LWRheS0wMWh4bTJ0ODRrYmbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Syracuse Basketball: 4-star PG Tyler Jackson says he talks to Orange 'every day',We caught up with ‘25 Tyler Jackson last weekend in Baltimore at @madehoops #EastMania and talked about his season with @OvertimeElite how his game has evolved working hard to achieve his goals the latest with his recruitment which team stood out to him in March Madness and… pic.twitter.com/DkmWXQcfiF
PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vamFyaW5nLmlkL2ZpbmRpbmctc29sdXRpb25zLXRvLWFkZHJlc3MtdGhlLWRhbmdlcnMtb2YtY2lnYXJldHRlLWJ1dHQtd2FzdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finding Solutions to Address the Dangers of Cigarette Butt Waste,"Starting from Jaya Wijaya Park then moving to Monjari Park a dozen members of Pemuda Penggerak (Youth Initiator Movement) in the city of Solo Central Java collected nearly 10000 cigarette butts in the parks.

That large amount of cigarette butts were found there despite the fact that the two parks have been designated as nonsmoking areas since 2019 following the enactment of the city’s Bylaw Number 9 of 2019.

Leader of the Youth Movement Cikal Ardinasari said that the thousands of cigarette waste scattered in the parks were collected for about 40 minutes.

“The omnipresence of cigarette butts proves that there are smokers at the places that are supposed to be no-smoking areas” Cikal told Jaring.id by telephone on Friday October 8 2021.

Therefore Cikal chose to hand over the cigarette trash to the city’s government office instead of throwing it directly into a garbage dump. She wanted to show the local government about rampant violation of the bylaw due to low supervision of the nonsmoking areas.

“We will continue to do that as a form of advocacy to the government” she said.

The movement to pick up cigarette butts has been carried out since 2017 by Cikal and her friends. “But when the Covid-19 pandemic began to emerge we had to halt this activity” she said.

Later only in January 2021 they were able to actively continue their activity of freeing public spaces from cigarette butts. Everytime they carry out the activity they never forget to wear gloves masks and bring garbage bags to collect the cigarette butts in order to protect themselves and keep the environment clean. “…because cigarette butts are waste” she said.

Similar to Cikal Rama Tantra a member of the Youth Tobacco Control Movement also initiated a movement to pick up cigarette butt trash. “We’re trying to do a campaign which sort of makes people aware that ‘one cigarette butt brings many problems’. We do this through policy advocacy” Rama said to Jaring.id by telephone on Sunday October 10 2021.

Initiated by 20 young people from all over Indonesia in 2019 this movement aims to reduce the prevalence rate of smokers.

The Basic Health Research published by the Ministry of Health in 2018 highlighted an increase in the prevalence of smokers in children aged 10 years. In 2013 the prevalence rate was 28.8 percent then it increased to 29.3 percent within the following five years (2018). Meanwhile the prevalence of smokers aged 10-18 years rose by 2 percent from 7.2 percent in 2013 to 9.8 percent in 2018.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic happened in December 2019 to be exact Rama and his fellow activists conducted an activity to clean up the area of the National Monument (Monas) from cigarette butt trash. Surprisingly they managed to collect more than 2000 cigarette butts within an hour.

Discarded cigarette butt is the one of the most-polluting waste for the environment. Thousands of cigarette waste are easily found in public spaces such as parks and bus stops including in areas that are supposed to be nonsmoking areas. “We want to make people aware that cigarettes are not only a health and economic problem but also an environmental problem” said Rama.

According to Rama the large quantity of cigarette butt trash that can be found in every corner of the city indicates that cigarettes can be easily accessed by the public.

A research from the Center for Social Security Studies at the University of Indonesia (PKJS UI) in 2020 showed that there were eight retail cigarette stalls around every school in Jakarta. Some of them are even located less than 100 meters from the school.

Conducted using Google Maps and Google Street View application this research found at least 8371 retail cigarette stalls in Jakarta. Thousands of these retail cigarette stalls are found mostly in densely populated areas.

The largest number of cigarette stalls were spread across East Jakarta with 3085; followed by West Jakarta with 2136; Central Jakarta with 1457; South Jakarta with 1293 and North Jakarta with 397 kiosks. “Cigarettes shouldn’t be sold per stick. The price should be more expensive to make it less affordable for the public” Rama hoped.

Even so not everyone appreciates what Rama and his fellow activists have done. Not infrequently they are considered doing it just for the sake of being a spotlight in social media content.

“The people who sneer at us don’t understand the dangers of cigarette butts” said Rama.

The large amount of cigarette waste in public spaces is not surprising for Tubagus Haryo the Deputy Chairperson of the Jakarta Citizens’ Forum (FAKTA). According to him this happens because the government has not paid attention to how to process cigarette butts. In fact cigarette waste is toxic since it is suspected to contain harmful substances.

“The treatment for cigarette waste should be the same as for the waste management for B3 (toxic and hazardous) materials. We have regulations on the processing of B3 but does the Ministry of Environment and Forestry give special attention to these cigarette butt problems?” Tubagus questioned.

He criticized that the Ministry of Environment and Forestry should be able to encourage cigarette companies to be more responsible for handling cigarette waste. This is in accordance with Law Number 32 of 2009 concerning the Environment which stipulates that producers who cause pollutants must recycle the waste they produce.

“Companies must be responsible for the waste of the packaging and the leftovers of the consumed products” he said. According to him cigarette companies can use corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to process the waste. “They can create a program on how to prevent cigarette butts waste from entering the water and soil” continued Haryo.

The results of research published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials explained that scattered cigarette butts is a hazardous waste. A comprehensive systematic review published by the Department of Environmental Health Engineering School of Public Health Iran University of Medical Sciences Tehran Iran estimated that around 5 5 trillion cigarettes are produced every year in the world. Meanwhile the waste of cigarette butts will reach 1.2 million tons and increase by 50 percent until 2025.

Researcher Javad Torkashvand revealed that there are thousands of harmful chemicals inside a cigarette butt such as arsenine benzene hydrogen cyanide PAHs pyridines and heavy metals. “Each cigarette butt can contaminate 1000 liters of water” wrote Javad Torkashvand in his journal.

Another study on the impact of cigarette butts was also reviewed by the Persian Gulf Marine Biotechnology Research Center Bushehr University of Medical Sciences Iran published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ)—a journal that focuses on health in 2017.

Researcher Sina Dabaradaran conducted an examination on the substances contained in a cigarette butt in 9 regions along the Persian Gulf during 10 days in 2015. The results found that cadmium (Cd) iron (Fe) acetone (As) zinc (Zn) manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni) were detected with varied amounts from 0.16 g/g to 123.1 μg/g in each substances contained in the cigarette butt. “It shows that large amounts of metal substances can enter the ocean every year from cigarette butts” said Sina.

Meanwhile research on the toxicity of cigarette butts published in the Journal of Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety Volume 113 in March 2015 revealed the adverse effects of cigarette butts on medaka fish (Oryzias Latipes). Research conducted by Wenjau Lee and Chih Chun Lee from the Department of Bioscience Technology Chang Jung Christian University Tainan Taiwan revealed that the concentration of cigarette butts can increase heart rate change behavior and even increase death. “This study shows that cigarette butts influence fish development and provides toxicological evidence of the ecological impact resulting from cigarette butts” said Lee.

Member of the National Tobacco Control Commission for Health Economics and Environment Jalal warned that cigarette butts contain harmful substances among others are toxic and plastic acetate. With this content cigarette butts should be categorized as toxic and hazardous substances. “Because plastic can take a long time to decompose in nature” said Jalal to Jaring.id when contacted by telephone on Saturday October 23 2021.

According to him it takes about 10 years to decompose cigarette waste. The decomposition will be faster if the cigarette waste is not buried in the ground or exposed to direct sunlight. “Therefore due to its nature we should decide on a more serious processing of cigarette butts and separate the processing of other wastes” he said.

In Government Regulation Number 101 of 2014 concerning Management of Hazardous and Toxic Waste it is explained that every person or company that produces B3 waste is obliged to store B3 waste. Other rules related to waste treatment are also contained in Article 123 of the Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry Number 6 of 2021 concerning Procedures and Requirements for Processing of Hazardous and Toxic Waste. This rule regulates in detail B3 processing from thermal start stabilization and solidification. Other ways according to technological developments such as bioremediation electrocoagulation and washing.

Even so said Jalal the cigarette industry has not carried out its responsibilities towards cigarette waste. “Tobacco companies have a shared responsibility to manage cigarettes. The firmness that is already in the law needs to be realized” said Jalal.

Based on an observation conducted by Jaring.id at one of the final waste disposal sites (TPA) in Rawajati South Jakarta there is no visible separation process between cigarette waste and other household waste. The cigarette butt is mixed with other waste during the waste management process.

The Director General of Management of Trash Waste Toxic and Hazardous Materials (B3) Management of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry Rosa Vivien Rahmawati denied that cigarette butts were categorized as B3 waste. Therefore no special treatment is needed for cigarette butts. “There are no cigarette butts containing toxic and hazardous waste” said Rosa Vivien Rahmawati via Whatsapp message on Thursday October 21 2021. However Rosa said the ministry had never examined the B3 content in cigarette butts. “Nothing yet” she continued without explaining further.

Meanwhile the Deputy for Health Improvement Coordination of the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Culture Agus Suprapto explained that the government did not include tobacco waste treatment in the revised draft of Government Regulation (PP) 109 of 2012 concerning the Safeguarding of Materials Containing Addictive Substances in the Form of Tobacco Products for Health. “Revision has not been set yet. It has not included cigarette butts either. If you have the data please show it to us and we will examine it later and decide what needs to be considered so as not to throw cigarette butts carelessly” said Agus to Jaring.id on Tuesday October 19 2021.

Agus said he would bring up the issue of managing cigarette butts in a cross-ministerial meeting. “I will first coordinate about these cigarette butt issues. I will discuss with the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs about the magnitude of the problems so that it can be considered an evidence base” he said.

Before this article was published Jaring.id had tried to contact a number of cigarette companies such as Wismilak PT Gudang Garam Tbk and PT HM Sampoerna Tbk. Of the three companies only PT HM Sampoerna responded.

Director of PT HM Sampoerna Tbk Elvira Lianita said the company has taken a comprehensive approach which included climate change mitigation water management waste management and prevention of deforestation. “It’s a form of pattern to reduce the environmental footprint” said Elvira Lianita via Whatsapp message on Wednesday October 27 2021.

As a company affiliated with Philip Morris International Elvira explained Sampoerna is committed to reducing plastic waste and cigarette butts by 50% in 2025. “Cigarette butts have smoke residue ash have an unpleasant smell and will decompose in a long time” she said.

Up to the present time PT Sampoerna has just done two things related to waste management of cigarette butts namely researching alternative lower carbon materials in cigarette filters and secondly increasing public awareness to dispose of cigarette butts in their place. “This research has been carried out by Philip Morris International for the last 10 years and we continue to look for alternatives that are fully biodegradable” said Elvira.

In 2020 PT Sampoerna stated that it had launched a research pilot program for recycling cigarette butts in collaboration with Waste4change. This program is carried out to overcome the impact of cigarette butt waste.

However Elvira admitted that the company had not found an economical and environmentally friendly recycling scheme on a large scale. “Environmental issues and plastic waste management are complex issues and are not limited to cigarette butts. Sampoerna is committed to taking an active role and collaborating with competent parties in overcoming environmental problems” concluded Elvira.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The oil and natural gas company company earned $1.57 per share or $1.58 if non-recurring items are removed. That beat Wall Street expectations by a penny according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

A year earlier it lost $680 million or 15 cents per share.

Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales.

Revenue was $73.79 billion also topping expectations.

Elsewhere in the sector Chevron Corp. reported similar results moving to a strong profit after posting a loss a year ago. The oil company's results also beat analysts' forecasts.

[Video not showing up above? Click here to watch » arkansasonline.com/1030exxon/]

Exxon's oil-equivalent production rose 4% to 3.7 million barrels per day in the third quarter. Production volumes in the Permian Basin averaged about 500000 oil-equivalent barrels per day up approximately 30% from a year earlier.

Oil companies were under pressure during the pandemic to curtail drilling after demand plummeted because so many people were staying home. Prices fell and exploration and production budgets were slashed. That resulted in less oil and gas on the market and in storage which in turn raised prices. But things have started to turn around as people get vaccinated and return to offices and begin to travel.

The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline spiked 13 cents over the past two weeks to $3.44 per gallon. The price at the pump is $1.22 higher than a year ago. Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday the rise comes as the cost of crude oil surges.

The energy sector has far outpaced the broader market in 2021. The S&P 500's energy stocks are up more than 50% compared with a roughly 20% gain for the overall index.

Exxon based in Irving Texas said it's looking into investing in lower-carbon business ventures. Its low-carbon investments are expected to be approximately $15 billion from 2022 through 2027. But the company along with others in the sector have faced growing criticism on climate change.

On Thursday ExxonMobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said that his company ""does not spread disinformation regarding climate change″ as he and other oil company chiefs countered congressional allegations the industry concealed evidence about the dangers of it.

Woods was among top officials at four major oil companies testifying as congressional Democrats investigate what they describe as a decades-long industry-wide campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming.

CHEVRON CORP.

Chevron Corp. on Friday reported third-quarter net income of $6.11 billion after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.

The San Ramon Calif.-based oil company said it had profit of $3.19 per share. Earnings adjusted for non-recurring gains came to $2.96 per share.

Earnings were so strong that the driller's net-debt-to-capital ratio has fallen below its target of 20% to 25% a key threshold that could spur an increase in stock repurchases Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said.

The results exceeded Wall Street expectations but Chevron does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $2.21 per share.

The company posted revenue of $44.71 billion in the period also beating Wall Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $42.47 billion.

Chevron pumped the equivalent of 3.03 million barrels a day during the quarter an increase of 7% from a year earlier aided by the purchase of Noble Energy in October 2020.

PHILLIPS 66

Phillips 66 on Friday reported third-quarter net income of $402 million.

On a per-share basis the Houston-based company said it had profit of 91 cents. Earnings adjusted for non-recurring costs came to $3.18 per share.

The results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.95 per share.

The oil refiner posted revenue of $31.47 billion in the period.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)



Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal has risen quickly in the ranks of Washington to become a powerful progressive leader on Capitol Hill since first winning her House seat in 2016.

Democrats control extremely narrow majorities in Congress a dynamic that has empowered moderates as well as progressives and the two factions have become locked in a power struggle.

Against that backdrop the Washington state Democrat has become a prominent voice for the party’s left flank and liberal policies as chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

Before coming to represent Seattle in Congress Jayapal was a state senator and a prominent activist for immigrants women and civil rights.

She won her first congressional race in 2016 and was endorsed by Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Once in Congress she quickly rose within the ranks of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and became known as a vocal critic of the Trump administration during the former President’s time in office.

Fight between progressives and moderates over Biden’s agenda

The congresswoman has in recent weeks been at the center of the action as her party works to finalize a sweeping package to expand the social safety net a key priority for President Joe Biden.

While moderates are focused on passing the infrastructure bill the priority for progressives has been to reach a deal to pass the larger social safety net package which would address health care aid to families and the climate crisis.

To ensure the larger package doesn’t get left behind House progressives led by Jayapal have made clear they won’t support the infrastructure bill unless the safety net bill moves in tandem.

That position has dramatically shaped the political landscape that top Democrats have had to contend with and forced House leadership this week to delay a vote on the infrastructure bill for the second time in two months. The outcome highlighted the power of the progressive caucus which has nearly 100 members making up close to half of the Democratic caucus.

The decision to push back the timeline for the infrastructure vote came at a critical moment for Biden’s agenda. It took place just hours after the President came to Capitol Hill to pitch House Democrats on a framework for his social safety net plan. That legislation has not yet been finalized or publicly signed off on by all Senate Democrats whose votes will be critical to its passage.

“The reality is that while talks around the infrastructure bill lasted months in the Senate there has only been serious discussion around the specifics of the larger Build Back Better Act in recent weeks thanks to the Progressive Caucus holding the line and putting both parts of the agenda back on the table” Jayapal said in a statement on Thursday.

“Now Congress needs to finish the job and bring both bills to a vote together” she said.

Jayapal’s rise as a progressive leader

Jayapal represents Washington’s seventh congressional district which includes much of Seattle as well as surrounding areas.

The Democratic lawmaker has the distinction of being the first South Asian American woman to be elected to the House according to her congressional biography which states that she was born in India and came to the United States to study at Georgetown University when she was 16 years old. The biography also says that Jayapal has lived in Indonesia and Singapore as well.

Jayapal spoke to CNN in an interview earlier this year about her vision for the progressive caucus and how she wants to see it operate as a unified bloc.

“We have to be able to say this is what the progressive caucus stands for this is what we’re fighting for” she said. “This is not a litmus test this is not a purity test but we do want people to generally be in line with the caucus on votes.”

The progressive caucus has taken on a higher profile in recent years as Democratic party rising stars have been elected to Congress and joined its ranks including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

​​The group has remained largely unified as moderates and progressives spar over Biden’s agenda a dynamic that has strengthened the bloc’s influence and Jayapal’s power amid the high-stakes negotiations.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) have demanded major cuts to Democrats’ Build Back Better bill a large climate and social spending package that’s been in the works for months. Progressives fear further cuts — and some worry the bill might be abandoned altogether — if Manchin and Sinema can’t be compelled to accept the $1.75 trillion spending proposal currently on offer.

Their strategy to pin the senators down was on display Thursday when the Congressional Progressive Caucus refused to move forward on a bipartisan infrastructure bill without a simultaneous vote on Democrats’ larger social spending bill. Because House Democrats have a narrow three-person margin any major defections can sink legislation.

Progressive members have for weeks demanded that the votes on the two bills be held together. They worry that Manchin and Sinema — who back the infrastructure package — could completely abandon the budget bill should infrastructure advance on its own given their longstanding opposition to the size of the measure and to several of the policies it contains.

The best way to guarantee that Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin support the President’s framework is for the Build Back Better Act to pass in the Senate first.



The people — not just some but ALL of our people — must win. — Cori Bush (@CoriBush) October 29 2021

To ensure the two senators support the spending package progressives are using the bipartisan bill as leverage: In order to pass one Democrats need to get on board with passing the other as well. Tying the two votes together is also a way to prevent moderate lawmakers from whittling down the spending bill even further. The sooner moderates agree to the latest spending proposal numbers the sooner they’ll get their vote on infrastructure.

“Congress needs to finish the job and bring both bills to a vote together” the Congressional Progressive Caucus wrote in a statement explaining their stance. “There is too much at stake for working families and our communities to settle for something that can be later misunderstood amended or abandoned altogether.”

Progressive pressure on Thursday secured an infrastructure vote delay which marked a win for them. It also followed a loss: The latest version of the spending bill which progressives have announced they’d accept includes some serious cuts. The plan released by the White House Thursday doesn’t include many of their key priorities including paid family leave and Medicare’s ability to negotiate prescription drug prices.

Despite this they appear to have now decided to take what they can. They want Manchin and Sinema to do the same and hope to use what leverage they have into making sure they do so.

What progressives hope to gain in the next week

Progressives called for the infrastructure vote delay for two reasons: They wanted specifics about the text of the social spending legislation and they wanted direct assurances from Manchin and Sinema that they’d vote to pass the social spending bill.

A core issue at play is a lack of trust: Because of how many cuts Manchin and Sinema have already demanded to key Democratic priorities (including reducing prescription drug prices increases to the corporate tax rate and eliminating the Clean Energy Performance Program) progressives are wary of their support for the Biden framework. Additionally neither senator has publicly said they support the framework. That has progressives concerned since Democrats have approved a budget resolution framework before only to have the legislation itself stall.

“I don’t owe them my trust and they don’t owe me theirs” Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) said in an MSNBC interview. “Let us see the vote. ... That’s how we know where you stand.”

Progressives’ concerns weren’t assuaged after the release of President Joe Biden’s $1.75 trillion framework for the legislation. While the CPC publicly endorsed the measure in principle both Manchin and Sinema issued positive statements about negotiations without any concrete commitments.

“As we work through the text of the legislation I would hope all of us will continue to deal in good faith and do what is right for the future of the American people” Manchin said in a statement.

“I look forward to getting this done expanding economic opportunities and helping everyday families get ahead” Sinema said in a separate statement.

I’ve lost count of how many interactions with reporters that Sen. Manchin has had today. His unwillingness to just come out and say he supports a WH framework - that was negotiated more directly with him than probably any other lawmaker - seems notable. — Garrett Haake (@GarrettHaake) October 28 2021

Progressives want a guarantee that all Democratic senators are actually on board with this bill and that Manchin or Sinema won’t blow up the framework. They’ve already seen this process play out once: Democrats in both the House and the Senate passed a $3.5 trillion budget resolution but both moderates balked at moving forward with that price tag and many of its components.

“We need to have certainty either through legislative text through … agreements … that we can trust” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told reporters Thursday.

The caucus’s demand for legislative text has led to results. In an effort to convince progressives to consider a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill the House Rules Committee released 1700 pages of tentative text on Thursday. That text didn’t wind up being enough for a vote because as with the framework Manchin and Sinema have yet to agree to it.

Jayapal noted Thursday that progressives would support adding policies back into the legislation that were stripped out of Biden’s framework like paid family leave and Medicare expansion provisions. She said however that progressive support for the framework was not contingent on these additions and that they stood behind the endorsement they’ve made.

Progressives won and lost this week

Thursday marked the second time progressives successfully blocked a vote on infrastructure over concerns about the spending bill. This time they faced increased pressure from congressional leaders to reverse their position in order to send Biden off to his coming G20 climate meetings with a legislative win to tout.

But the caucus held firm.

Originally progressives had identified five broad areas where they wanted investments: the care economy affordable housing climate jobs a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients and reductions to prescription drug prices. The original $3.5 trillion version of the spending bill included many of these issues but because of Manchin’s and Sinema’s concerns multiple areas were significantly cut back or dropped entirely.

Biden’s new $1.75 trillion framework ultimately invests heavily in early childhood education and climate but does not include a major provision to help reduce prescription drug prices a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients or paid family leave.

And areas that survived cuts still saw dramatic reductions in spending. For example Democrats’ original budget measure contained $450 billion for long-term home care and $332 billion for affordable housing. Biden’s framework meanwhile includes $150 billion for the former and $150 billion for the latter.

Sinema has opposed Democrats’ more expansive proposals to reduce prescription drug prices — but agreed to a narrower option that includes a smaller pool of drugs. A pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients also isn’t expected to make it into the legislation because of the rules governing the budget reconciliation process and the Senate parliamentarian’s existing ruling advising against its inclusion. And paid family leave has run into opposition from Manchin who’s worried that the policy would be too burdensome for businesses.

Biden’s framework still has about $100 billion allocated for immigration reform though it’s unclear whether it will make it past this procedural hurdle. Democrats’ latest pitch to the parliamentarian will focus on issues like the legal visa backlog and a shield from deportation for some unauthorized immigrants the New York Times reports. Lawmakers are also still finagling some of the details for the bill leaving the door open for the possible return of some policies.

Progressives back the framework even with the existing omissions. In its current state it includes several of their demands on child care subsidies funding for clean energy tax credits and a Civilian Climate Corps. Additionally they argue that the talks on the bill wouldn’t have even happened without the pressure they’ve put on Democratic leadership and moderate lawmakers.

“The reality is that while talks around the infrastructure bill lasted months in the Senate there has only been serious discussion around the specifics of the larger Build Back Better Act in recent weeks thanks to the Progressive Caucus holding the line and putting both parts of the agenda back on the table” the CPC said.

Although they are standing their ground on legislation timing they appear willing to accept the policy concessions that have already been made. “We wanted a $3.5 trillion package but we understand the reality of the situation” said Jayapal.

As Facebook faces a firestorm for changing its corporate name to Meta amid heightened scrutiny over how the tech titan harms humanity Greek economist and Progressive International co-founder Yanis Varoufakis on Friday called out the company for stealing the moniker of a global anti-capitalist think tank.

Varoufakis in a tweet took aim at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who announced the new name at a conference Thursday as the social media company contends with widespread criticism of its practices thanks to revelations from former-employees-turned-whistleblowers.

""Hands off our mέta Our Center for Postcapitalist Civilization Mr. Zuckerberg"" tweeted the former Greek finance minister who is on the think tank's advisory board. ""You and your minions wouldn't recognize civilization even if it hit you with a bargepole.""

The mission page of mέta's website explains that ""we are already in the early stages of an era that can only be described by that which it succeeds: we live in postcapitalist times. They may turn out dystopic utopic or anything in between.""

""Through art and research argument and poetry"" the site says ""mέta (the abbreviation of our Our Center for Postcapitalist Civilization) works to break with a dystopic present to imagine the world anew—to grasp our present historical moment so as to help radical progressive movements find a path from the emergent dismal postcapitalism to one worth fighting and living for.""

Along with Varoufakis other advisory board members include scholar Noam Chomsky musician Brian Eno filmmaker Ken Loach economist James K. Galbraith and philosopher Slavoj Žižek.

In addition to the social network Facebook Meta also owns the photo- and video-sharing platform Instagram as well as the messaging application WhatsApp.

As Common Dreams reported Thursday while Zuckerberg celebrated the new corporate name for the company tech ethicists and branding professionals warned the world not to be ""fooled"" by the move.

""It's tempting to view Facebook's rebranding as nothing more than a cynical attempt by the company to distance itself from endless scandals and the real-world harm caused by its surveillance capitalist business model. But it's actually much more sinister than that"" said Evan Greer director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future in a statement Friday.

""With this announcement Mark Zuckerberg revealed his end game: He's making a play to control the future of the Internet"" she asserted accusing the CEO of ""co-opting the terminology of decentralization and attempting to solidify his stranglehold on the future of human attention and interaction.""

Emphasizing the the importance of recognizing that ""the Internet is changing"" Greer argued that ""we need to fight tooth and nail to ensure that the policies governing this next generation of the Internet are carefully crafted to protect vulnerable communities free expression and human rights––and that they don't undermine the potential of truly decentralized technologies which could help finally end the era of Big Tech surveillance capitalism.""

""We are at a crossroads"" she said. ""It's time to decide what we want the future of the Internet to look like. And then it's time to fight for that vision.

Despite having run very different campaigns — Adams warned of rising crime and repeatedly said public safety was a prerequisite to prosperity while Bragg led with pledges to dial back prosecutions dramatically — Adams touted the supposed sameness of the two men’s approaches to crime saying “It’s no different than mine.” He added: “Those (who) would try to pull us apart they will create these tensions and fights…Shut up. Shut up.” Adams and Bragg in charge.

Though he would prefer not to hear it Adams must know that Bragg’s stance as a progressive prosecutor is potentially at odds with the former cop’s promises to remedy what he describes as New York’s state of disorder. Even if the next mayor empowers the NYPD to make more arrests a DA unwilling to prosecute would leave cell doors wide open for suspects — many with long rap sheets — to walk right back onto the streets. This comes on the heels of legislative changes like bail reform and the recently passed Less is More Act both of which will already constrain Adams from achieving the crime rate reductions he’s promising New Yorkers.

While several of Gotham’s past mayors faced similar public safety challenges none have had to contend with the dramatically changed conceptions of the DA’s role that have taken hold today. For more than three decades Manhattan DA Robert Morgenthau led an office that conceived of its responsibilities as distinct from the political and policy fray. “The prosecutor’s job is to protect the public and to administer the laws” said the long-serving Democratic public servant.

Ironically in the 12 years since his retirement DAs now regularly flaunt their eagerness not to enforce the law.

Case in point: guns. New York City boasts one of the strictest gun control regimes in the nation. Progressives have long championed these policies as necessary to prevent more legal guns from causing harm. But laws aimed at deterring illegal ones are now in doubt. Bragg whose plan states that “not every person charged with possessing an illegal gun in New York City is a driver of violence” promises not to prosecute certain cases of illegal possession and to eliminate one-to-three year sentences for violations. That cuts against the spirit of Adams’s proposals to bring back the NYPD anti-crime plainclothes unit focusing on gun removal and use precision policing to rein in the recent spike in shootings.

In fairness Bragg believes that his plan will allow for a greater focus on violent firearm use and fewer unnecessary convictions for nonviolent offenders. But if progressives believe gun control laws are necessary to keep inherently dangerous legal guns off the streets logically they should seek to enforce other laws aimed at deterring illegal possession.

Fortunately on guns Adams need not rely exclusively on unwilling DAs. Because firearm offenses often violate state and federal law simultaneously the mayor may well steer the NYPD to federal prosecutors’ offices in the Eastern and Southern Districts.

But other crimes don’t share the same jurisdictional overlap especially quality-of-life offenses that ordinary New Yorkers of all political persuasions care about. Bragg vows he will not prosecute instances of alleged trespass resisting arrest driving with a suspended license or consensual prostitution-related crimes among other things. He likewise promises to shift the default away from prosecuting larceny under $250 and disorderly conduct. That’s hardly the message New York’s retailers want to hear as they and their customers contend with a shortage of goods caused in part by blatant shoplifting. And it chafes against Adams who has promised “we’re not sitting back watching people walk into Duane Reades and other stores and grabbing garbage bags full of supplies.”

To see what may become of Gotham if Adams and Bragg can’t align their policies on crime look to the dire lessons of other cities with progressive prosecutors. Philadelphia’s Larry Krasner who decriminalized drug possession and diverted much illegal gun possession recently lamented this year’s 18% rise in murders and “terrible spike” in gun violence. Krasner’s relationship with Mayor Jim Kenney has now broken down entirely with the two publicly trading insults. In Chicago progressive DA Kim Foxx recently refused to charge five suspects in a West Side shootout that left one dead and others wounded. Fed-up Mayor Lori Lightfoot — herself a progressive and former prosecutor — has requested that the U.S. attorney’s office review the case.

Regardless of any misgivings or disagreements about the merits of progressive prosecution in general all should agree that public servants who avoid this dysfunction serve everyone’s best interests. Bragg’s impressive background equips him well to join the next mayor in rectifying a city beset by violence and disorder. Retaining the flexibility and discretion to prosecute all offenses would grant New Yorkers the full benefit of his prudence — and avoid a standoff with the city’s next mayor.

For proof all you need to do is ­unpack the Biden administration’s so-called Environmental Social Governance agenda and its ties to BlackRock the world’s biggest money-management company headed by Larry Fink which manages more than $9 trillion in assets.

BlackRock has been an active cheerleader for White House policy toward ESG — the practice of prodding industries to enact climate-control measures and adopt other lefty shibboleths such as board diversity as part of their business models — and profit from it without attracting much attention from the usual suspects.

Since his days on the campaign trail Joe Biden has made no secret that he wants much more government in the economy. Now that he’s president Biden’s Securities and Exchange Commission is no longer intent on merely protecting small investors from financial fraud; it now wants to reverse climate change by imposing ESG standards on all public companies that mandate disclosure of their carbon footprint.

Corporate governance used to focus on what companies can do to deliver profits over the long haul. No longer. The Treasury Department’s Financial Stability Oversight Council recently identified “climate change as an emerging and increasing threat to US financial stability.”

It doesn’t end there. The Biden Labor Department is now proposing a new rule that would force companies and their 401(k) sponsors to include investments that adhere to ESG standards. To make room for these new ESG offerings the best-performing funds will take a back seat to funds that adhere to the woke mandates.

Again the revolving door is nothing new; big business is always looking for ways to shape government policy in ways that serve its self-interest. What’s different here is how big of a role people associated with Larry Fink’s BlackRock have taken in formulating national ESG policy and how much the company stands to profit from it with barely a peep from that aforementioned gotcha crowd.

For those who don’t know Fink he’s one of the most fascinating powerful and woke figures on Wall Street. His firm runs money for individuals businesses and governments across the globe also managing the Fed’s massive portfolio of debt off and on since the 2008 financial crisis.

Fink is a billionaire and his success enabled him to become a key player in the Democratic Party. And he hasn’t been bashful in deploying BlackRock’s clout to advance Democratic economic causes in ways that happen to support its bottom line.

3 Larry Fink is a “woke” investor writes Charles Gasparino. Brendan McDermid/REUTERS

Last year he famously wrote an open letter threatening to push for the removal of board members of companies BlackRock invests in if they refuse to toe the progressive line on climate change.

More recently he has vowed to make ESG a centerpiece of BlackRock’s investing model. As Eleanor Terrett of Fox Business has reported BlackRock now offers more than 150 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (investment pools that trade like stocks) that adhere to ESG standards — more than any other firm on Wall Street.

BlackRock manages more than $400 billion in ESG client money which means it’s making money hand over fist being an environmentally aware corporate citizen since according to Terrett these funds can carry fees that are as much as 40 percent higher than other similar investments. (BlackRock counters that its ESG ETFs are cheaper.)

Fink meanwhile has some important help in advancing this profitable ESG investing model. As it turns out the Biden administration is stocked with former BlackRock people who are doing the same on a national regulatory level.

Take Brian Deese the current head of the National Economic Council. He was Fink’s global head of sustainable investing. Or take Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo. He was Fink’s former chief of staff and is one of the top advisers to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who is a key player in the national ESG push.

There are other BlackRock people serving in the Biden administration with more tangential ties but who are powerful nonetheless. They include Michael Pyle BlackRock’s former global chief investment strategist. He’s now chief economic adviser to VP Kamala Harris. Then there’s Tom Donilon chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute. His brother Mike Donilon is Biden’s senior adviser and chief campaign strategist.

The White House didn’t return calls for comment. BlackRock said in a statement that “climate risk is investment risk. We do believe that limiting the impact of climate change is better for the economy and will lead to higher growth.” Fink for his part may really believe climate control is necessary for mankind to survive. Deese who according to his latest White House disclosure held $2.4 million in BlackRock stock may also be pushing for government policies without thinking twice about how it benefits his old firm.

But appearances do matter. And the appearance of a revolving door between BlackRock and the White House deserves more scrutiny."

Why it matters: The inability to get goods made and shipped is raising prices and dragging down the global economy.

More automation will help improve efficiency eventually but a more sustainable supply chain may require companies to pivot from ""just in time"" to ""just in case.""

Driving the news: U.S. GDP growth slowed to 2% in Q3 2021 a lower-than-expected number economists attributed to the Delta variant and supply chain problems.

According to the Freightos Index the median cost of shipping a standard metal container from China to the West Coast hit $20586 in October — almost double what it cost in July which was already twice what it cost in January and 700% higher than the cost a year ago.

Be smart: While the idea of a supply chain crisis can make it sound as if the global economy is experiencing a shipping deficit of some sort in fact more goods than usual are flowing.

That's the problem: the pandemic led consumers to shift from spending money on services to spending on goods — well beyond what the global supply chain could handle — while COVID-related disruptions damaged the ability of factories to get the components and labor they needed to make all that stuff.

— well beyond what the global supply chain could handle — while COVID-related disruptions damaged the ability of factories to get the components and labor they needed to make all that stuff. Add to that the years of companies prioritizing ""just in time"" manufacturing and shipping with little excess inventory on hand to cushion disruptions and you have a supply chain crisis.

""What's important is not so much the 60 or 80 container ships lined up off L.A. — that will eventually get resolved"" says Hamid Moghadam CEO of San Francisco-based Prologis the largest industrial real estate company in the world. ""It's a fundamental issue of capacity to carry more inventory in the system so that you don't have a problem.""

The catch: There's a reason companies embraced ""just in time"" rather than ""just in case"" strategies — a dollar spent on banked inventory is a dollar that can't be invested elsewhere. Many goods like fashion or high technology products will also quickly lose value over time if stored in a warehouse as a hedge against logistics crises.

Moghadam notes that one solution could be to build more warehouses closer to consumers — which would benefit his company as a leading logistics landlord — but that often meets resistance with the public.

""People want their stuff immediately but they don't want to deal with the traffic and the congestion"" he says.

What's next: Since consumers are unlikely to abandon their desire for rapid shipping — especially since the pandemic led to a boom in e-commerce — one longer-term solution is to make the supply chain more efficient through automation and other technological advances.

The Colorado-based startup Outrider is automating operations in yards within distribution facilities where goods move from trucks and other transport lines to warehouses. That can help reduce costs and improve safety notes Outrider CEO and founder Andrew Smith.

San Diego-based Platform Science develops smart fleet management technology that keeps trucks on the road connected strengthening ""actual links in the supply chain"" says Jack Kennedy the company's CEO and co-founder.

As 3D printing matures it will allow companies to produce necessary components where and when they're needed sidestepping both ""just in time"" and ""just in case"" for ""make on demand.""

By the numbers: Investors are paying attention — a record $45.1 billion has been raised by industrial startups so far this year according to Pitchbook compared to $34 billion for all of 2020.

Yes but: Those investors need to understand it can be harder and take longer to create change in sectors that deal in ""atoms rather than bytes"" says Will O'Donnell managing partner of Prologis Ventures the company's VC arm.

The bottom line: The pandemic-related supply chain crunch won't always be with us but further crises will recur unless we can fundamentally change how we get things from A to B.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This was announced by the Public Hygiene Council (PHC) on Sunday (Oct 31) as it expanded the SG Clean Day initiative - which started in April this year - from an annual to quarterly affair.

There will be no sweeping at all public parks gardens park connectors open areas and ground levels of housing estates from 6am to midnight during SG Clean Day. This is aimed at raising public awareness about the amount of litter piled up without cleaners' intervention.

SG Clean Day is expected to become a monthly event next year.

The expanded initiative was kicked off by the PHC along with the National Parks Board and all 17 town councils at Bukit Batok's Fuji Hill Park.

PHC also launched a community storage shed known as CleanPod at the park where residents got their first glimpse of tools like tongs buckets and trolleys that they can use.

Twelve of these sheds were previously set up at public parks for residents to tap. More are expected to be rolled out across all town councils over the next few months.

Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor who was the guest of honour at the event noted how the pandemic has highlighted the importance of public health and hygiene.

""The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the demands on our cleaners. Having initiatives like this gives our cleaners some warranted time-off and is a tangible way for us to show our appreciation for the work of the cleaners"" she said.

Dr Khor cited the 2021 Public Cleanliness Satisfaction Survey conducted by Singapore Management University with 97 per cent of respondents agreeing that residents must work together with cleaners to keep their neighbourhoods clean.

""I hope that SG Clean Day will help to further instil a sense of ownership in members of the public so they play their part and keep public spaces clean"" she added.

Town councils will regularly disinfect equipment in the CleanPods and residents are advised to wear gloves while picking up litter.",,,,,,

Yes it might cost more than a basic iPad but it's less than an iPad Pro and this product sits roughly between those two popular products on the tablet continuum.

But even with a good set of features and a reasonable price Android tablets can be a tough sell. Apple's iPads running iPadOS continue to dominate the tablet market and what people think of when they think ""tablet."" Along with Samsung companies like Lenovo Huawei and Amazon (through its Fire tablet line) offer a wide array of iPad alternatives although none truly stands out as a compelling reason to switch from another operating system beyond offering better interoperability with Android phones.

Joseph Kaminski/CNET

The Tab S7 FE has an upscale feel with a 1.3-pound aluminum body and slim bezels that allow more viewing space with a smaller footprint. Devices from the iPad Mini to the Microsoft Surface Pro have trimmed screen borders so the S7 FE is on trend. The 12.4-inch display has a 2560x1600-pixel resolution with a 60Hz refresh rate. It has a 5-megapixel selfie camera and an 8-megapixel camera on the back. Inside the processing is handled by a Qualcomm SM7325 chip and it ships with Android 11 as its OS.

The Galaxy Tab S7 FE includes a stylus. Joseph Kaminski/CNET

If you want color options you'll have to go with the Wi-Fi version which comes in pink silver green or black. The S7 FE starts with 64GB of internal storage but you can configure it with 128GB 256GB or 512GB as well. The microSD slot can support cards up to 1TB. Unfortunately the 5G version is limited in spec options as well as color: It's black only and only comes with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Plus you'll have to pay for data every month.

Samsung also offers the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus which looks almost identical to the S7 FE but it has four speakers to the FE's two. The S7 Plus also has a Super AMOLED display with a slightly higher resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate versus the TFT display with a 60Hz refresh rate in the S7 FE. If you want those extra features of the S7 Plus it will run you $849 (£799 AU$1449).

The S7 FE supports facial recognition to unlock the tablet or you can use a passcode or pattern. Unfortunately there is no built-in fingerprint reader as in the more-expensive S7 Plus. While face login on Windows PCs and iOS devices usually works fine for me in this case it didn't recognize me as often as I had hoped it would.

Joseph Kaminski/CNET

If you're switching over from using an iOS device you may also find the landscape camera placement off-putting compared with the portrait position on iOS devices. Then again with more people using video chat since the start of the pandemic this might be a welcome change and could make Zoom chats easier.

Camera placement is also important because if you're using facial recognition to unlock your device but are more accustomed to the iPad's camera placement you might be covering the S7 FE's camera with your fingers (this happened to me several times). That's why I'd appreciate a fingerprint reader so I could hold the tablet in any position when unlocking the device.

I tested the tablet using Samsung's Book Cover Keyboard ($160) which magnetically attaches to the tablet and protects the screen and back. There's a handy slot cut out for easy access to the included S Pen stylus. The S Pen also magnetically attaches to the back of the tablet.

Joseph Kaminski/CNET

Performance and battery life

The Qualcomm-powered Galaxy Tab S7 FE won't blow you away with its performance. Even the less expensive ninth-gen iPad outshone the S7 FE in benchmark tests like Geekbench 5 and 3DMark Wild Life Extreme Unlimited. In practical hands-on testing the S7 was able to smoothly handle Google docs MS Office 365 suite web surfing and streaming media. Games from the Google Play store like NBA 2K Need For Speed: No Limits and my old guilty pleasure Minion Rush ran smoothly as well. If you want to stay in the Android garden at least its walls are a little more porous than on an iPad. For example you can get apps for the Samsung Galaxy S7 FE from both the Google and Samsung app stores.

Geekbench 5 (multicore) Microsoft Surface Pro 8 5257 Apple iPad (9th Generation) 3358 Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE 1876 Note: Longer bars indicate better performance

Geekbench 5 (single-core) Apple iPad (9th Generation) 1332 Microsoft Surface Pro 8 1217 Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE 654 Note: Longer bars indicate better performance

3DMark Wild Life Extreme Unlimited Microsoft Surface Pro 8 5338 Apple iPad (9th Generation) 1866 Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE 1108 Note: Longer bars indicate better performance

Geekbox Product name Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE Price as reviewed $829 Display 12.4-inch TFT 2560x1600 @60Hz PC CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G PC memory 4GB RAM Storage 64GB internal/expandable to 1TB Ports USB-C Networking Cellular 5G Wi-Fi 5 Bluetooth 5.0 Operating system Android 11 Weight 1.3 pounds

As for battery life I was able to get just under 12 hours of video streaming over 5G on a single charge. The hefty 10090-mAh battery probably didn't hurt. The tablet can be fully charged in 4 hours with the 15-watt adapter that comes with it but also there's a fast-charge option with a 45-watt adapter sold separately. That should allow you to get a reasonable amount of battery charge in just a few minutes.

Joseph Kaminski/CNET

When it comes to sound the S7 FE can pump up the volume loud enough to fill a room without crackling from two speakers on opposite sides. The tablet supports Dolby Atmos and Samsung says the dual speakers were ""tuned by AKG.""

Ralph Lauren said its NY flagship stores is getting color-dye technology that could let customers dye their own clothes by next year.

The project was initially developed to improve the iconic apparel company's environmental footprint in the manufacturing process.

This DIY component to Ralph Lauren's production line could use an ""experiential retail"" model to draw people back to stores.

Ralph Lauren is putting part of its production process in the hands of customers as businesses look to the experiential retail model to draw customers back to stores.

The fashion company known for its iconic polos revealed its flagship stores will be equipped with new textile-coloring technology that could potentially let shoppers dye shirts in-store as early as next year a partner with Ralph Lauren on the technology told CNBC.

The details of the in-store dyeing process which are still largely unknown and under development would allow let a customer take one of Ralph Lauren's blank-slate cotton tees or polos choose a color and have its Color on Demand technology dye the product in-store right before purchase.

Giving the consumer some creative agency in the the production process ""has always been a powerful thing"" Simeon Siegel retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets told CNBC. ""Bringing the consumer into the story has always been a winning proposition.""

As the consumer economy re-emerges from the coronavirus pandemic retailers will have to balance e-commerce with their brick-and-mortar models which may mean moving toward converting larger stores into ""experiential retail"" leaning on customization and rapid production. Ralph Lauren previously allowed customers to take part in the production experience customizing colors for its iconic horse-patch to be sewn onto clothes purchased online.

""The store will become more experiential each and every day"" Siegel added. ""The trick is how to capitalize on it to sell more things.""

Earlier this year Ralph Lauren said it partnered with several materials textile and chemical companies including Dow to develop a more eco-friendly production process that relies on less water energy use and harmful chemicals. The companies announced a new system in March called ""Color on Demand"" including a new textile treatment called ECOFAST Pure which uses up to 40% less water 85% fewer chemicals and 90% less energy than traditional dyeing processes.

""Ralph Lauren obviously is a big user of cotton and to dye textiles it takes a lot of chemicals and a lot of water and you generate a lot of waste and mainly you do that because you're trying to use heat and pressure to put that dye into the fabric"" CEO of chemicals company Dow Jim Fitterling said at a CNBC summit for corporate sustainability and environmentalism.

The new color dye system could help Ralph Lauren better plan amid supply constraints that many retailers continue to face allowing them to ""better balance inventory"" and more efficiently anticipate demand for their products without having to worry about ordering details like color.

Ralph Lauren said in a press release that it is aiming to use Color on Demand in more than 80% of the company's solid color cotton products by 2025. The company also announced earlier this month it would open-source the dyeing process for the textile industry.

If the colors that apparel retailers choose for their latest lines often aren't to your liking or by the time they hit the store shelves seem behind the latest trends on the sidewalks or on social media a solution may be coming sooner than you imagined. By next year Ralph Lauren flagship stores may have the textile coloring technology to let shoppers have the blank slate of cotton polo shirt dyed in-store. Chemicals giant Dow  a major player in textile dyes has been working with Ralph Lauren on new processes for cotton dyeing that reduce use of chemicals water and energy intensity. ""Ralph Lauren obviously is a big user of cotton and to dye textiles it takes a lot of chemicals and a lot of water and you generate a lot of waste and mainly you do that because you're trying to use heat and pressure to put that dye into the fabric"" Dow CEO Jim Fitterling said last Thursday at the CNBC ESG Impact summit. Trillions of liters of water for example are used for fabric dyeing which is equal to 20% of the world's wastewater. That is one of the reasons Dow developed what it calls ECOFAST Pure announced earlier this year which to dye cotton needs up to 90% less chemicals 50% less energy and 50% less water. But the sustainability project could also have major implications for what is called experiential retail — the effort by retailers to give consumers new reasons to come into stores as e-commerce's footprint already large only grows as a result of the pandemic. Ralph Lauren's Color on Demand project uses the Dow technology to color cotton at any point in manufacturing and result in shorter lead times for making color decisions. Halide Alagöz chief product and sustainability officer at Ralph Lauren said in an announcement about the effort earlier this year that the retailer will be able to ""meet personalized consumer demands faster than ever before."" And while he didn't say it that means potentially coloring a shirt in the store. ""Ralph Lauren will be able to do something like put Color on Demand in one of their flagship stores in New York next year so that you can go in and get your Ralph Lauren polo dyed in the store"" Fitterling said at the CNBC ESG Impact event. ""That would have never been possible without this technology."" A Ralph Lauren spokeswoman said ""We look forward to sharing more about this in due course.""

The post-pandemic era of experiential retail

Coming up with new strategies to more deeply involve the consumer in the apparel production experience is not new for Ralph Lauren. It has allowed shoppers to customize colors for its iconic horse logo sewn into shirts for apparel ordered online. Other retailers such as North Face have been letting consumers pick and choose the components of jackets and have their preferences manufactured into the whole. Customization and faster fashion that embeds the individual consumer in the shopping narrative is going to play out in many ways in the retail sector. Levi Strauss & Co. CEO Chip Bergh has said the traditional sizes will be a thing of the past in fashion as 3-D body scanners and camera technology combined with much faster manufacturing will allow retailers to make clothes a unique fit for each person. Nike and Amazon both have made body-scanning technology acquisitions in recent years. Pre-pandemic every conversation in retail was about selling experiences over things and while the lockdowns may have put much that had been in the works on pause as digital became the only way to do business those strategies will now come back into focus. ""E-commerce has gained points of penetration and mindshare and will not give it back"" said Simeon Siegel retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets. ""But strong stores that made it through the pandemic are even stronger and are not likely to go away."" That means an increasing blend of e-commerce and experiential stores especially for high-profile locations. ""The store will become more experiential each and every day"" Siegel said. ""The trick is how to capitalize on it to sell more things."" Allowing a consumer to choose a color and have a piece of apparel dyed in a store could help to create the type of emotional attachment tied to a purchase that is key to retail's future. Making the consumer ""the creator"" according to Siegel ""has always been a powerful thing. Bringing the consumer into the story has always been a winning proposition."" ""People want to get back out after the pandemic"" said Ivan Feinseth chief investment officer and director of research at Tigress Financial Partners. ""Lots of ideas got shelved because of the pandemic but will come back. A good portion of retail still takes place in a store"" he said. Customization and rapid production of apparel that allows consumers to choose color is an interesting development because the process of fabric preparation has historically been toxic and only able to be done by workers wearing protection in plant settings. ""The chemicals to dye stuff the whole handling of how companies get rid of stuff ... you don't take excess dye and dump it in a sink"" he said though he added that removal of chemicals from many products such as cleaning products is becoming much more common. Dow declined to elaborate on its CEO's comments. Ralph Lauren said in its official announcement that the goal is the world's first ""scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system"" and the first phase which will be in use with traditional dyeing equipment will use up to 85% less chemicals. By 2025 it aims to use the Color on Demand platform in more than 80% of solid cotton products. The companies also announced earlier this month that they are open-sourcing the dyeing process for the textile industry.

Breakthroughs in color technology

Multiple breakthroughs in fabric coloring are underway. Digital textile printing is already changing the way consumers control color and pattern. ""The sky is the limit to what consumers can order and receive"" said Ken Butts global key account manager at Datacolor which works with retailers on the implementation of digital color solutions for their supply chains. That has been mostly limited to online companies doing it for DIY crafters and for patterns rather than solid colors on fabrics including upholstery or curtains though it is moving into apparel too. ""We're seeing companies investing in their own digital printers or print samples and the next step is printing directly for consumers"" he said. Digital printing is able to respond to consumer interest and demand quickly but it will not replace traditional dyeing any time soon because among other factors there are many fabrics which it still cannot handle. ""It doesn't mean that won't be overcome some day"" Butts said ""but your typical polo shirt it is manufactured first to look like a shirt and then dyed in the form of a shirt. You can't print it you can't twist it around in there [the printer]."" The traditional approach to dyeing a piece of clothing like a polo shirt requires an intensive process with hundreds of gallons of pigment and a significant amount of large-scale machinery which would never be feasible for a store setting but even in industrial textile facilities there are smaller machines used to test color samples. ""Anywhere in the world you find a factory dyeing fabrics on large-scale equipment thousands of pounds at a time they will have a similar piece in the lab on a small scale and that's where the manufacturer is testing their ability to make a specific color"" Butts said. ""The first step for a supplier when a retailer asks for a new color is to test it on smaller equipment."" The smaller equipment still requires chemicals and water and the end of the process will include waste disposal issues but as technology improves it is not unreasonable to foresee a future in which retailers can dye fabric in-store especially larger flagship-style stores where space is not constrained. Customers may be able to come into a store and pick a color from a palette or maybe even bring in a color with them and software will be able to translate that into the dyes required. But timing will be an issue for an in-store revolution in color-dyeing. Chemical dyeing even at its most efficient can still take as long as an hour to produce the final garment. But for both consumer and retailer that might still be better than the current process. ""Now designers are choosing a palette that will appear in a store six to nine months from now summer 2022 and trying to predict consumer trends"" Butts said. If retailers get the trend wrong that may result in a rush process of new manufacturing and transport which has high costs and by the time they get the new units they may still miss trend. ""With this you can respond to current hot trends"" he said. A consumer could come into a store with a color in mind maybe they saw someone else wearing it and within a day or two the apparel can be produced and the retailer didn't need to order 10000 shirts in advance. ""Dying fabrics to customer preferences is really exciting"" Butts said.

Sustainability and the apparel consumer

Datacolor focuses on translating colors into numerical codes that can be communicated between designers and textile manufacturers in the supply chain cutting down on the need to ship physical samples back and forth during the design process and aiding quality control efforts related to making sure the color is correct when it comes time to manufacture thousands of pieces. That is a more efficient approach to apparel production than a designer in one location sending color palettes to dye mills around the world which then have to send back fabric samples for visual review — ""back and forth until the designed finds something they like"" Butts said. But whether it is digital innovation or dyeing innovation the retail industry has a sustainability issue that will remain challenging to address. Faster communication in the design and manufacturing process and faster fashion is enticing for shoppers but a consumer turning over a wardrobe more frequently is not necessarily being more sustainable even if the underlying processes used to produce the piece require less resources and energy. And giving consumers more reason to come into stores — and potentially spend a longer time while waiting for a custom item to be finished leading to possibly even more purchases — means more consumption. ""You can eliminate all the big pigments in the machines but at the end of all of that you are still left with a garment or fabric"" Butts said. ""That question still has to be addressed. I like seeing improvements in the coloration process but we still need to address sustainability from an end-to-end view."" ""Let's face it"" Siegel said. ""In retail the most sustainable option is to not sell the item in the first place."" Manufacturing that is less harmful and less energy intensive with a lower carbon footprint is a good thing for retailers and brands but it does not address consumer waste and landfills which is why retail models are evolving in multiple ways including the focus on resale and reuse businesses such as Rent the Runway which went public last week and repurposing of items to extend the life cycle. The Ralph Lauren-Dow partnership may be novel in how its sustainability in manufacturing story can lead to a new narrative in experiential retail for the consumer but no brand has the answer to the bigger question. ""The retailers are in the business of selling more units but also in the business of improving their sustainability. The question is how to marry those two"" Siegel said. ""They need to balance a high-wire act of being better without alienating consumers convincing consumers the best thing is to walk away. And that story is yet to be written.""",,,,,,,,,

In 1965 the Stones played a Clearwater concert. “We played four songs and then got kicked off the stage” Jagger said. Every fan knows the rest of the story — they went back to the Fort Harrison Hotel and Satisfaction was born.

“Now the hotel belongs to the Church of Scientology” Jagger said. “We heard they had to ritually cleanse the site of our pernicious influence.”

The roaring crowd seemed glad to have that influence back dancing and singing along and ignoring a few drifts of raindrops on a cool breezy night. The Tampa date finally played after the band’s No Filter tour was postponed more than a year ago in the early part of the pandemic was a rock ‘n’ roll celebration of life tinged with a sense of loss.

The show opened with an empty stage a powerful recorded drumbeat and on the tall video towers images of Charlie Watts. The band’s original and for almost 60 years only drummer Watts died in August at the age of 80. (Fashion item of the evening among the audience: Charlie Watts memorial T-shirts.)

Then the fireworks went off and the Stones charged into Street Fighting Man the first song in a nonstop two-hour 19-song set.

Yes the core members of the band are in their 70s. Yes we used to think rock ‘n’ roll was a young person’s game. Turns out it can keep you young.

Ron Wood hasn’t changed much still an impish stage presence and a blistering guitar player although his cheekbones are now so deeply etched you could hide an acorn in there.

Keith Richards was long the edgiest member of the crew with a cigarette dangling from his piratical sneer and a legendary capacity for partying. He has changed: With a beaming smile a fuzzy hot-pink knit cap and sneakers with glow-in-the-dark stripes he seems downright cuddly.

Jagger still moves like Jagger: the hip shake the shoulder shimmy the dash down the runway in front of the stage. Generations of rock singers have imitated those moves but Mick is the original article and as mesmerizing as ever.

The set list was almost all greatest hits but when you’ve made as many greatest hits as the Stones why not? The first half of the concert featured lots of sing-alongs: Get Off of My Cloud Tumblin’ Dice Start Me Up and a glorious version of Honky Tonk Women that could probably be heard in space.

There was a handful of less familiar songs like Sad Sad Sad from the 1989 Steel Wheels album. At each tour stop ticket holders vote for one Stones deep cut to be performed. Tampa chose Far Away Eyes from the 1978 Some Girls album a tongue-in-cheek country song graced by Wood‘s steel guitar.

The only new song the band performed was the eerie reggae-tinged Living in a Ghost Town which Jagger introduced as “our lockdown song.”

Jagger got his customary two-song break mid show when Richards took the mic in good voice to sing Connection and Happy. He offered heartfelt thanks to the audience and expressed his joy at being back on the road “doing what we do.” With a benevolent smile and a wave of the hand he said “God rains upon you all. Bless you.”

Jagger Richards and Wood are the core members but there were 11 performers on stage every one an ace. Jagger pointed out that keyboard player and music director Chuck Leavell first played with the Stones 40 years ago this week; Leavell demonstrated his chops with a rousing gospel piano solo at the end of You Can’t Always Get What You Want.

The newest member stepping into Charlie Watts’ impossibly cool shoes isn’t really new. Veteran drummer Steve Jordan had Watts’ blessing to fill in for him on the tour and he has played with Richards on solo projects since the 1980s so he has slipped pretty much seamlessly into the spot.

The second half of the show began with Miss You more heartbreaking than ever before and then turned into an express train: Midnight Rambler Paint It Black Sympathy for the Devil and Jumpin’ Jack Flash.

The encore gave backup singer Sasha Allen a turn in the spotlight in Gimme Shelter and she delivered with a wailing solo and a fiery duet with Jagger that ended with them walking off the runway hand in hand.

And at the end of course back to the touchstone: Satisfaction.

The boy was identified as 9-year-old Noah Reeb. The Utah boy’s battle with brain cancer and how the Tampa Bay Buccaneers helped inspire him to beat the disease was chronicled in an ESPN segment on Sunday. Brady sent a video to Noah and his family during the journey.

""I always watch that video. Just like to remind me of … I mean Tom Brady thinks I can beat cancer so I guess I can beat cancer"" Noah says in the video.

His parents promised him that when he beat cancer and was healthy enough to travel they would take him to see Brady live. By late summer the cancer was gone.

Noah and his father were at the Oct. 24 game against Chicago and Buccaneers wide receiver Chris Godwin was the one who got Brady’s attention. The seven-time Super Bowl champion went up to Noah before the end of the game and give him his hat leaving him with tears of joy.

""I was in shock. I don’t really believe it’s happening. He sticks the hat on my head. He shakes my hand and he says something like ‘Nice job buddy’"" Noah said.

On Sunday before the Bucs played the New Orleans Saints Brady had another message for Noah.

""Thank you for your inspiration Noah"" Brady wrote. ""We can all learn so much from you. You may not know it but so many people in the world admire you for your courage and bravery and how you’ve dealt with a really tough situation. Thank you and your family for your beautiful blessing.""

Brady and Tampa Bay demolished the Chicago Bears last week 38-3. Brady was 20-for-36 passing for 211 passing yards and four TDS including the 600th touchdown pass of his career.

Speculation about higher-end notebook GPUs from Nvidia has been flying around for quite some time now although previous leaks from a few months or so back pointed to the possibility of an RTX 3080 Super model (plus 3070 Super for that matter).

This fresh spillage has pinned the Ti label rather than Super branding on the purportedly incoming RTX 3080 variant with the theory being that this product will be based on Nvidia’s GA103 GPU (GN20-E8) as noted in a tweet from Matthew Smith which VideoCardz spotted (Smith is the keeper of TechPowerUp’s GPU database).

it seems the RTX 3080 Ti Mobile will use the GA103 chip.October 30 2021

The leak as VideoCardz explains actually originates from somebody posting on a PCI Device ID database with the handle ‘Faintsnow’ who is presumed to work for a graphics card maker. Faintsnow added the details of the GPU and confirmed that it’ll be the ‘GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU’ when questioned on what Nvidia’s name for this graphics solution would be.

No other details are provided here so the info imparted is admittedly thin on the ground.

Analysis: Some kind of high-end laptop GPU inbound for early 2022?

Obviously we need to keep a healthy sense of skepticism about the veracity of this as that original source is a murky one really.

That said this is a rumor which has been kicking around for a while and it does seem a likely move for Nvidia to release a laptop GPU with more oomph in the near-ish future – previously the grapevine has held that this mobile graphics card (or cards) could be unveiled early in 2022. Meaning we might be looking at a CES launch in January 2022 and if that is the case we’d expect to be hearing a lot more from the rumor mill on this GPU in short order.

There has been some controversy in the past about whether the supposed RTX 3080 Ti or Super might step up from the GA104 employed in the notebook RTX 3080 card to use the GA103 as indicated here because as you may recall regular rumor peddler Kopite7kimi – who first spilled the goods on the GA103 laptop chip – said at one point that it was quite likely canceled.

Kopite7kimi chimed in with this latest leak as well speculating that maybe this new discovery could even be an RTX 3090 mobile not a 3080 Ti. On the naming front it should be noted that Nvidia has never used the Ti suffix for a mobile GPU so there’s that to bear in mind too when it comes to the name guessing game.

Here’s how it works

Despite NVIDIA providing an option with GeForce Now to utilize the power of an RTX 3080 for cloud gaming it would seem that a more powerful graphics option may soon be available natively for laptops.

Database maintainer of TechPowerUP GPU and GPU-Z Matthew Smith believes that NVIDIA is developing a first time ever flagship TI of its Geforce RTX series for laptops. Graphics card specialty website Videocardz has spoken with Matthew Smith as to the origins of these claims.

An individual with the handle ""Faintsnow"" submitted a codename to the TechPowerUP database with the code ""GN20-E8"". Subsequently the codename was updated to ""GA103"" by the same individual. A few days ago the product name ""GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU"" was assigned to the codename's ID in the TechPowerUP database. Since this database is typically maintained by individuals who work with GPU vendors it stands to reason that Smith's assumptions may be correct.

Although it would seem that a high-performance laptop variant of the RTX series is inbound there is less clarity in regards to what the naming of the GPU will be. There had been earlier leaks in regards to an RTX 3080 SUPER GPU associated with a Lenovo laptop and another instance where well-known leaker of all things NVIDIA @kopite7kimi speculated that it may in fact be named the RTX 3090M.

Apple earned US$83.36 billion with an annual growth of 29%. iPhone sales contributed US$38.87 billion growing 47% year-over-year. Mac and iPad revenue also grew and came in at US$9.18 billion and US$8.25 billion respectively representing a 1.6% and 21.4% annual growth.

Apple has failed to meet its Q4 revenue targets. In its final quarterly investor call for 2021 Apple reported US$83.36 billion in revenue a 29% growth. The projected revenue for the quarter was US$84.85 billion. Explaining the drop in revenue CEO Tim Cook told CNBC” We had a very strong performance despite larger than expected supply constraints which we estimate to be around $6 billion. The supply constraints were driven by the industry wide chip shortages that have been talked about a lot and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia.”

All of Apple’s products including software and services saw annual growth. iPhone revenue came in at US$38.87 billion a 47% year-over-year increase. Services revenue increased 24.6% to US$18.28 billion. Mac revenue ended up at US$9.18 billion a 1.6% annual growth. Coming in at US$8.25 billion iPad revenue also saw a 21.4% increase. Other products including the Apple Watch and AirPods brought in US$8.79 billion after experiencing 11.5% annual growth.

The lower-than-anticipated Q4 numbers have resulted in Apple shares dropping 4% on Friday morning resulting in Apple losing its position as the most valuable company in the world to Microsoft. Microsoft now enjoys a market value of US$2.46 trillion beating Apple’s valuation of US$2.43 trillion. Microsoft's lead over Apple follows a strong earnings report that saw its shares rise 0.9%. The Windows-maker saw its quarterly revenue grow by 22% despite the ongoing chip shortage all thanks to the stellar performance of the Office business and cloud services.

This is not the first time that Microsoft has overtaken Apple. The company saw its value rise above Apple's in July 2020. However Apple retook the lead in the following month. Something similar can happen if the supply chain constraints ease to let Apple meet iPhone 13's strong demand.

NVIDIA is reportedly preparing a new high-end laptop GPU offering with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile which will reportedly use the GA103 GPU.

The new rumor is coming from Matthew Smith who maintains the TechPowerUp GPU and GPU-z database that NVIDIA is working on a new flagship mobile GPU. It will reportedly use the GA103 GPU (GN20-E8) but we don't know the total configuration (CUDA cores etc) just yet.

We should see the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile be quite a beast hopefully with around 7680 CUDA cores and a 256-bit memory bus. We could see 8GB or 16GB of GDDR6 memory used but it would be nice to see some of that ultra-fast GDDR6X memory used inside of a super-fast new RTX 3080 Ti Mobile GPU.

VideoCardz reports: ""We spoke with Matthew on the actual source of this information. The name originated from the PCI Device ID database. A person nicknamed ""Faintsnow"" was first to submit a codename ""GN20-E8"" to an ID of 2420. The codename has later been updated to ""GA103"" by the same person. And finally just four days ago a product name ""GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU"" for this ID was posted in the database"".

VC added: ""We were unable to confirm whether ""Faintsnow"" had previously submitted similar information but it should be noted that no one else has been able to tie ID:2420 with any name or product. However this database is usually maintained by people working for GPU vendors so it is very likely that it is not based on pure speculation""."

As a science enthusiast I am constantly seeking out news on scientific topics.

My interests lie primarily in the human microbiome — the collective genomes of the microbes composed of bacteria bacteriophage fungi protozoa and viruses that live inside and on the human body. But it has been hard to escape news about Covid-19 over the past two years. During this time I became aware of Regeneron’s novel Covid-19 antibody technology. It is inspiring to know that a leading pharmaceutical company resides so close to my home and school. Its presence has always existed but my relation to it had not formed until I had the opportunity to speak with Dr. David Buckler.

Dr. Buckler is a senior director for research program management in the section of noninfectious diseases at Regeneron. His role includes overseeing and coordinating various research field departments that become interconnected at the onset of a new drug development. Understanding a development as simple as plant growth requires knowledge of the biological structure of plant cells the physics of water moving through a plant and the chemical reaction that creates energy for the plant. Buckler’s knowledge on biotechnology biochemistry as well as his outgoing friendliness and overall experience in the STEM field made for an interesting conversation.

Buckler’s passion for science emerged as a result of his immersion in the scientific community from an early age. His father worked alongside notable Nobel laureates at a the National Institutes of Health and frequently brought young Dr. Buckler along. He recalls fondly being greeted as a regular guest by his father’s colleagues every time he entered the lab. Despite this his actual high school education was limited to the fundamental science courses offered. He took part in the regular STEM courses but it was his inherent interest in science and the ability to develop methodological steps to a posed research question that led him to pursue a chemistry degree at Reed College.

After graduating college he went on to conduct independent research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both research positions allowed him to grow in experience and knowledge. When he was looking for his next opportunity to grow as a researcher he landed at Regeneron.

I asked Dr. Buckler to tell me more about how drugs are developed at Regeneron. VelocImmune® mouse technology used for the creation of monoclonal antibody candidates. He explained its use in creating successful treatments for devastating epidemics such as Ebola and Covid-19. Feats such as these were daunting unattainable fantasies when he was in college and now he was overseeing and coordinating this sort of work. Achievements in the scientific community often begin this way – with a farfetched concept or question. Over several years steps are taken to reach incremental conclusions and reinforce or discover new information. This is the nature of progression in the STEM world.

At the end of our conversation I shared with Dr. Buckler my own interest in studying the gut microbiome. I wondered if he had any insight into the direction of research in that field. He said that although the human microbiome is an immensely diverse environment and a difficult one to control and observe it is the students and scientists that take initiative to understand it that are needed in this world. Its vital role in physical and mental health and an origin point to several common illnesses makes it a worthy area to focus novel research on. Its challenging nature provides a plethora of opportunity and requires the dedication of researchers that will persevere and show grit in their work. It struck me when he said that such a scientist could be me! I will be forever grateful for this encouragement and conversation with Dr. Buckler. I am eager for a career in STEM to be a part of my future.

The government agency confirmed the agreement with pharmaceutical supplier Roche to purchase Ronapreve on Sunday and said it expected the drug to be in the country by Christmas.

The drug mimics the natural antibodies that the immune system makes to fight the disease. It belongs to the class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies or mAbs.

Also known as Regeneron (the name of the company that developed it with Roche) and REGEN-COV it was used to treat former US president Donald Trump when he contracted Covid-19 last year.

Health Minister Andrew Little said it will help treat people with medium-to-severe Covid-19 especially those with compromised immune systems.

He said it reduces the severity of the virus and makes it less likely patients will pass it on to other people.

Pharmac chief executive Sarah Fitt said getting vaccinated was by far the best line of defence against Covid-19. But: ""It's good to know New Zealand will have another treatment available for those who do become unwell"".

Ronapreve can be given to contacts of known cases or used in the early asymptomatic stages of the illness to prevent those who are especially vulnerable to Covid-19 becoming more unwell. This could potentially keep them out of hospital Fitt said.

And ""it can actually be used in very sick patients in hospital intensive care.""

""The unprecedented nature of the pandemic and the ongoing health risks posed by Covid-19 means Pharmac is continuing to seek out other treatments to be used to help those with Covid-19.

""To fund these other treatments we're using a dedicated budget allocated by Government to make sure New Zealand can access new Covid-19 medicines.""

Rescuers were able to rescue 15 people from a second cabin.

An operator of a cable car died when the cabin disengaged from its cable while descending a mountain in the north of the Czech Republic on Sunday a rescue service spokesperson said.

Czech emergency services evacuated 15 people unharmed from a second cabin used to climb to the top of 1000-meter (3300-foot) Jested Mountain near the city of Liberec.

What do we know so far?

""One cabin fell while on its way down"" rescue services spokesman Michael Georgiev told Czech television. ""There was one person inside who unfortunately succumbed to their injuries.""

The death was later reported to be a staff member by Martin Puta head of the regional government.

""Fortunately the other cabin stayed in its normal place. Some 15 people were evacuated. They should be without injuries just suffered mental shock"" Georgiev added.

The fire brigade rescued the tourists from the second cabin which was located at 15 meters above the ground. Psychological counsellors treated them for shock after the ordeal.

TV station CT online reported that the cabin fell from a height of 30 meters before crumpling onto the side of the mountain.

What went wrong with the cable car?

The cause of the accident was unclear but the CTK Czech news agency said the cable car operators Czech Railways were going close the cable car down for maintenance on Monday.

Czech TV station CT24 said that when the first cabin crashed down it caused the second cabin to move downhill on the well anchored cable.

Opened in 1933 and reconstructed in the 1970s the cable car service was reopened in 1975.

Jested Mountain is the highest peak of the Jested–Kozakov Ridge offering visitors views to Germany and Poland. It hosted an element of the Nordic World Ski Championships in 2009.

But at what cost?,"This story was reported and published in partnership with The Marshall Project a nonprofit news organization covering the U.S. criminal justice system. Sign up for their newsletter or follow The Marshall Project on Facebook or Twitter.

In 2017 Walter Jordan wrote a memo to a federal judge from the Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence. “Notice of Impending Death” it said in a shaky hand.

Jordan told the judge that Arizona corrections officials and Corizon Health the state prison system’s private health care contractor at that time delayed treating his cancer for so long that he would be “lucky to be alive for 30 days.” Jordan 67 had a common form of skin cancer that is rarely life-threatening if caught early but said he experienced memory loss and intense pain from botched care. Other men in his unit were also denied treatment he wrote “all falling yelling screaming of pain.”

Jordan was dead eight days later.

Reviewing his medical records later Dr. Todd Wilcox a physician hired by lawyers for the state’s prisoners agreed that Jordan’s death was likely preventable. Corizon’s treatment of Jordan’s “excruciating needless pain” was “the opposite of how cancer pain should be managed” he said.

Wilcox will take the stand in a landmark trial that begins Monday in Phoenix the latest chapter in an almost decade-long struggle to determine whether Arizona’s prisoners are getting the basic health care they are entitled to under the law.

The trial pits Arizona against the people held in its prisons who argue in a class-action lawsuit that the medical services they receive are so poor they constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The state’s current health care contractor Centurion is the latest in a string of companies that have failed to pass muster with the courts.

None of the companies have been named as defendants in the lawsuit because the claimants say the state is ultimately responsible for their care. The suit was originally filed in 2012 shortly before private contractors took over Arizona’s prison medical services. But whether privatization can provide decent care is one of the biggest issues looming over the trial.

The Arizona Department of Corrections declined to comment on pending litigation. Centurion of Arizona and Corizon based in Tennessee did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Arizona is one of around two dozen states that use a private for-profit contractor to provide prison medical care and almost all have been sued. But a trial is rare as most states settle to avoid this kind of exhaustive public scrutiny.

Health care in Arizona prisons is “grossly inadequate” the prisoners have said in court papers with crisis-level understaffing delayed or denied treatments and unreliable access to medication.

Attorneys have chronicled a man who died after his swollen legs split open the wounds weeping pus and swarmed by flies; a man with mental illness who was in such distress that he chewed off parts of his fingers; a man who entered prison with a small bump on his face that went untreated and became a disfiguring baseball-sized tumor; and several people denied access to regular mental health care who later killed themselves.

The trial could spell the end of privatized care in Arizona prisons — or in a more extreme outcome the end of Arizona's control over its prison health care entirely. U.S. District Court Judge Roslyn Silver could appoint an outside official to run it who would answer to her or she could impose additional financial sanctions against the state. Ultimately Silver will have to decide: How much cost-cutting is too much when lives are at stake?

Although the trial will not directly affect other state systems experts say the outcome could show officials across the country that courts are serious about enforcing health standards in prison — and that not providing adequate care can have real consequences.

The case is “a great example of why we have it all wrong” said Homer Venters a correctional health care consultant who spent years as the medical director for the New York City jail system. Instead of a judge looking over administrators’ shoulders “the jail has to stop operations if the conditions are inhumane or if the care is not adequate” he said.

Few prison health care systems get high marks for quality care regardless of whether the government or a private company provides services. At least 47 states have been the target of major lawsuits. The judge in a landmark case in California — where health care was not privatized — was so appalled by medical services in prisons there that in 2006 he appointed an outside official to take over the state’s $1.2 billion prison health care system.

But bringing companies with a profit motive into the mix poses additional problems some experts warn especially in a setting where patients have so little control over their care. “They’ve got every incentive to delay treatment or provide more minimal treatment or to count something as treatment when it’s not really treatment” said Michele Deitch a University of Texas senior lecturer who studies prison conditions. “It would be so much cheaper to just do the things than spend the money on fighting it.”

How private companies took over prison health care

Until the 1970s every state provided medical care in its own prisons. But these services were “inadequately available and frequently primitive” said Douglas McDonald a researcher at health consulting firm Abt Associates. There were few doctors on staff and scant health care standards. Prisoners without medical training were known to pull teeth dispense medications and perform minor surgery on each other according to one case in Alabama.

Then in 1976 the Supreme Court found that “deliberate indifference by prison personnel to a prisoner's serious illness or injury” was cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. A series of cases in the decades that followed clarified that people in prison are entitled to routine and emergency medical dental and mental health care that is “adequate … at a level reasonably commensurate with modern medical science.”

These court decisions forced prisons to hire hundreds of medical personnel and pay for hospital stays and expensive procedures. Just as health care in broader society began relying on “managed care” to limit costs some states started privatizing prison medical care using small contractors to provide hard-to-hire staff and negotiated rates with hospitals specialists and pharmacies McDonald said.

Arizona began contracting out its prison health care in 2012 around the time several of these small companies combined to create the major industry players of today.

The newly merged and fast-growing companies were an attractive investment for private equity says Dan Mistak acting president of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services a nonprofit that helps prisons and jails improve health care. Unlike hospitals and other settings subject to Medicare’s strict quality standards Mistak said prison health care is paid for almost entirely from state coffers which eliminates many requirements that drive up cost — and quality — on the outside.

Medicare provides “stringent accreditation processes and data transparency” says Monik Jiménez an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. In prisons “we don’t have any of that with these private providers.”

Arizona has employed three prison health care contractors over the past decade: Wexford then Corizon and now Centurion. The ongoing lawsuit — as well as allegations of subpar care sidestepping court-imposed quality control measures and chronic understaffing — have dogged all three companies.

The number of medical staff decreased by 11% from 2012 to 2019 despite Arizona’s prison population remaining relatively flat leaving prisons with hundreds of fewer providers than they needed according to court documents. During its six-year tenure Corizon paid the state more than $3 million in fines for failing to hire enough doctors and nurses.

After years of fighting in court in which the state denied all allegations officials agreed to settle the case on the eve of trial in 2014. The Arizona Department of Corrections pledged to improve care by ensuring its health care provider met more than 100 benchmarks including: providing adequate access to counseling and mental health care providing timely referrals to specialists and following instructions of hospital doctors who release patients.

“When prison officials settle a case of this nature it’s usually because they recognize that there is a problem and there’s some commitment to fix it” said ACLU National Prison Project Director David Fathi who represents the incarcerated people suing the state.

But the problems have persisted. Two judges have separately held the state in contempt and levied fines totaling $2.5 million for failing to meet the quality standards it had agreed to.

In a recent whistleblower account — the latest in a string of such stories — a former prison nurse alleged that the company directed her to lie on a medical report in order to save Centurion $100000 in court sanctions.

The state has spent years contesting the evidence pushing back on recommendations from court-appointed experts and appealing court orders losing most of them.

Finally this year Judge Silver rescinded the settlement agreement and set the case for trial writing in a scathing order that she could no longer trust the state was making a good-faith effort to meet the terms of the settlement.

Dustin Brislan says Arizona’s failure to meet health care standards nearly cost him his life.

Brislan 39 who is serving 17 years at the state prison in Tucson on various charges including armed robbery is a named plaintiff in the lawsuit. Among other care issues he said medical staff switched him from an antipsychotic medication that helped stabilize him to an anti-anxiety drug he told them had not worked in the past.

As a result Brislan said his mental health deteriorated into a yearslong cycle of self-harm: cutting himself then being placed in isolation for weeks or months as a result of the cutting which led to additional self-harm. At one point he almost bled to death.

“They are trying to cut corners and save money” he said “rather than give us the medications we need.”

Does privatization really save money?

Arizona state Rep. John Kavanagh sponsored the 2011 legislation that privatized health care in state prisons. One of the main goals ""was always to save money in tough economic times” he told The Arizona Republic in 2012.

But cost savings have been elusive from the start.

An earlier version of the bill required that privatization save the state money but when no company could do that Kavanagh removed the requirement. The legislature pressed ahead with privatization and the lowest bidder Pittsburgh-based Wexford Health got the initial contract which cost the state about $116 million a year about $5 million more than the state spent the previous year.

Since then costs have increased each year and with each vendor change. For the 15-month period that began in July Arizona agreed to pay more than $216 million to Centurion. That doesn’t include the more than $21 million the state has spent on attorney’s fees and other costs of litigation to defend its care in court.

A similar scenario played out in Florida where an outside auditor said privatization both decreased the quality of care in Florida’s prisons and cost the state more money.

In 2017 the Pew Charitable Trusts published a report that detailed how each state structured its prison health care and how much each state spends.

Centurion’s health care contract was the most common structure. The state pays the company a set amount per incarcerated person per day creating what critics say is a perverse incentive: If the company spends less it pockets the difference.

Pew’s findings underscore the question of whether privatization actually saves states money. Data from the report showed no meaningful difference in per-patient spending between states with privately-run and publicly-run health care.

Arizona was near the bottom of the pack spending $3529 per patient per year compared to a national median of $5720. Only five states spent less. Of those two provide their own care two have a contractor providing care and one uses a mix of both.

In 2019 Dr. Marc Stern a correctional health care expert appointed by Judge Silver to review Arizona’s prison health care system identified tens of millions of dollars in state spending on privatization instead of health care. The spending ranges from the vendor’s profit margin to lawyers to manage and oversee the contract to duplication of services to the hundreds of hours that staff on both teams spend facilitating transitions from one vendor to another.

“Privatization has not served and will continue to not serve (Arizona Department of Corrections) well” Stern said.

Maria Schiff a health policy analyst and one of the authors of Pew’s report said the money a state spends on health care is only one piece in a much larger equation. The state’s oversight of care high and measurable quality standards and efficient use of resources all matter too.

“What kind of care is a state (and more importantly its incarcerated individuals) getting for the money it does spend?” she said.

An avoidable but 'sadly predictable' death

The upcoming trial is set to last three weeks. Eight incarcerated people will take the stand alongside state officials and medical experts.

Among the voices who will not be heard is Walter Jordan who sent notice of his impending death to the court. But his experience — a litany of mismanagement and incompetence that led directly to his death — was “was sadly predictable” wrote Wilcox the outside expert.

According to Wilcox as someone who already had skin cancer in the past Jordan should have been provided extra-strong sunscreen but a Corizon nurse denied it. When Jordan developed a scalp lesion Corizon sent him to a dermatologist who should have sent him immediately to an oncologist because the lesion had grown so large. But they didn’t.

The dermatologists’ attempts to remove the growth on Jordan’s head “burn[ed] a hole in his skull bone” allowing the skull to become infected and the cancer to invade his brain. A provider wrote in Jordan’s chart “THE WOUND IS HORRIFIC.”

One explanation for such poor decision-making according to Wilcox: The legislature had set unreasonably low caps on how much the state was willing to pay outside specialists a problem compounded by millions of dollars in bills to outside hospitals and providers that Corizon left unpaid.

“The completely foreseeable result of not paying specialists or paying them very little is that there is an ever-shrinking pool of specialists willing to see prisoners and the quality of those willing specialists can be lower as was the case here” Wilcox wrote.

Wilcox warned more people would have similar experiences unless there were drastic changes.

So far the lawsuit has outlasted lawyers Department of Corrections directors the original judge and even the original plaintiff in the case known as Parsons v. Ryan.

Victor Parsons had a stomach infection in prison that went undiagnosed for so long it caused permanent damage. After his release at the age of 42 he was shot and killed by police in Tucson in 2019 after a standoff at his girlfriend’s apartment.

In an interview conducted while still behind bars Parsons said he was proud to be part of the case. “Even though people forgo their freedoms when they come to prison” he said “they shouldn’t have to forgo their lives.”

DALLAS — A little more than half of Dallas workers reported feeling underpaid.

In a recent study by California-based talent solutions firm Robert Half 55% of Dallas workers indicated that they felt underpaid. Among the 28 cities surveyed Dallas tied for fifth with Houston.

Nationally the report found that 49% of U.S. employees felt underpaid. Workers between 18 and 24 and women are more likely to feel underpaid—57% of employees aged 18 to 24 and 52% of women indicated feeling shortchanged.

About one in three workers nationwide reported they are considering quitting their job if they don’t get a raise. Locally that number was higher with 36% of Dallas workers indicating they would consider quitting if they don’t receive a raise. Dallas ranked eighth in that mark and was the highest-ranked Texas city.

The study also found that salaries are rising. The starting salary for professional occupations is expected to increase 3.8% in 2022. Almost half of employers are offering new hires signing bonuses.

Despite the salary increase the study found that workers weigh more than just the salary when considering a job offer. Many employees factor flexible work schedules remote work options and employee discounts into their decisions.

“While salary prospects are brighter for 2022 professionals should always do their research before asking for a raise or jumping for an opportunity with higher pay” Paul McDonald Robert Half senior executive director said in a news release. “Many factors contribute to job satisfaction such as advancement opportunities and schedule flexibility so it’s important to consider the full picture before making a move.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3RoZWF0aGxldGljLmNvbS8yOTIxNzAzLzIwMjEvMTEvMDEvYS15ZWFyLW9mLXJvYmVydC1zYW5jaGV6LWFuYWx5c2luZy10aGUtYnJpZ2h0b24ta2VlcGVycy1hZ2dyZXNzaXZlLXN0eWxlLWFuZC1odWdlLXBvdGVudGlhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A year of Robert Sanchez: Analysing the Brighton keeper's aggressive style and huge potential,"Two moments in Brighton’s 2-2 comeback draw against Liverpool at Anfield showed the risks and rewards with Robert Sanchez.

In the first half playing out almost cost Brighton dear when Sanchez’s attempted clearance from near his goalline was charged down by Sadio Mane. It seemed as if Liverpool were 3-0 up and out of sight but the video assistant referee Kevin Friend spotted that the ball had hit Mane’s arm. Undaunted by that mistake Sanchez started the move that led to Brighton’s second-half equaliser from Leandro Trossard with a pinpoint pass to Marc Cucurella on the left. “The second goal comes from Rob with a fantastic pass” Graham Potter told The Athletic. “He knows that moment (in the first half) is a mistake and can happen. “He’ll want to improve from that and we’ll help him but that’s just life part of being a young goalkeeper but he’s been amazing since he came in. “He helps the team comes for crosses that are just incredible relieves the pressure (has) calmness with the ball. “He’s only young as well. It’s Anfield — some challenge for him — but he does really really well.” The 23-year-old who was born in Spain with an English father and Spanish mother has made incredible progress since making his Premier League debut a year ago. Sanchez started last season as fourth choice at Brighton having progressed through the academy after moving from Levante at the age of 15. He has kept 14 clean sheets in 37 Premier League appearances conceding 38 goals and making one error leading to a goal according to Opta. That form has catapulted him into Luis Enrique’s Spain squad. It has been a remarkable rise for Sanchez after Potter made a bold call to hand him the gloves last season at the expense of established Australia No 1 Mat Ryan who joined Real Sociedad this July following a loan spell with Arsenal last season. We asked our goalkeeping expert Matt Pyzdrowski to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of Sanchez to understand what makes him such a special talent.

He’s Brighton’s first attacker Taking a closer look at his skill set it’s easy to see why Potter goalkeeping coach Ben Roberts and the rest of the coaching staff rate Sanchez so highly.

In the team’s build-up Sanchez takes up the position at the base of the defence as the first “attacker” out of the back similar to what you would expect from the central defender in a back three.

This helps the goalkeeper create more passing options for his team-mates. It allows the centre-backs to split out wide and the wing-backs to advance past the first line of pressure and into midfield creating a positional advantage over the opponent and more solutions in build-up play.

Pep Guardiola said after Manchester City’s 4-1 victory in Brighton’s last home game: “They know exactly what to do. They make the build-up with a good goalkeeper.”

Brighton didn’t back down from their principals and continued to play aggressively out of the back despite playing against one of the top defensive pressing teams in the league.

In the third minute of the game with Brighton under immediate pressure from City Sanchez and his team-mates set the foundation for the way they approached the task.

Despite being under pressure from City’s front three of Phil Foden Bernardo Silva and Jack Grealish they put together an impressive string of passes to bypass the initial line of pressure.

With Foden closing down Sanchez his first pass is a short ball to the left to Dan Burn.

Almost instantly as Foden changes the direction of his press Burn takes one touch away from the defensive pressure and sends the ball back to Sanchez.

At this moment no one would fault Sanchez if he had switched the play and gone across the field to Lewis Dunk. It would have been the safe pass to try to open up space — you can even see Pascal Gross in the middle of the field with his left hand pointing to the right side of the field for the switch.

But that’s not what Sanchez does. Rather than play the safe ball he waits for Foden to close him down and sends a splitting ball back across his body towards left-back Cucurella.

After a quick interchange of passes Brighton successfully break the first line of pressure bypass four City players and allow Adam Lallana to attack.

Brave feet

It’s worth looking at one more example to underline just how confident and brave Sanchez is with the ball at his feet.

With Brighton 3-0 down his perfectly weighted pass up the middle to Lallana helped them break the first line of pressure and jumpstart an attack.

There are two important variables when playing out of the back for the goalkeeper: the options that the outfield players are giving him (where they are supposed to be and when) and the goalkeeper’s decision-making process (assessing the situation in front of them).

With the ball at Sanchez’s feet you can see Lallana with his hands in front of his chest gesturing that he wants the ball after his goalkeeper has brought it forward.

The moment Sanchez brings it forward that is Lallana’s signal to drop into position behind the first line of pressure as quickly as possible.

After moving his first touch in front of him Sanchez sends a perfectly weighted pass to Lallana between the two pressing players from City.

It might appear to be a risky ball but this is precisely the type of pass Potter wants and needs his goalkeeper to make consistently.

In the blink of an eye Lallana finds himself in space after a quick turn and following a speedy pass to Cucurella on the wing (who is just out of frame) Brighton once again find themselves in an advantageous attacking position against City.

Sanchez’s statistics for the match indicate how much he gets on the ball and just how impactful he has been for Brighton.

In total he completed 58 passes with a pass completion percentage of 85 per cent. A stellar feat in any match even more so against the defending champions.

58/68 – Robert Sánchez attempted 68 passes against Manchester City yesterday finding a teammate with 58 of them. Since full game-by-game pass data is available for the Premier League (2003-04) both figures are record highs for a goalkeeper in the competition.

Pass master

Although most of Sanchez’s passes are shorter ones it’s his mid-to-long-range passing and ability to switch the play at a moment’s notice that make him stand out.

It is not enough to just have good feet — as one of Potter’s goalkeepers you must also have intelligence and sound judgment.

In this clip from the first half against City Sanchez’s accurate one-touch cross-field ball to left-sided centre-back Burn eliminated three players from the visitors’ press.

This cross-field pass allowed Burn to receive the ball with several metres of space in front of him to turn comfortably break the pressure and attack City in an area of the field where they were vulnerable.

Brighton went from having a two-v-three disadvantage on one side of the field to a four-v-two advantage on the opposite side due to one single pass.

There are very few goalkeepers in the Premier League who can hit these types of cross-field balls as accurately and consistently as Sanchez.

Later in the first half Sanchez was again precise with his cross-field passing skipping five City players in the process. This time it was the trajectory and pace of his pass that made the outcome of this play possible.

Due to Sanchez’s effective pass Jakub Moder had so much time on the ball that he was able to take his first touch with his right foot do a full turn and take the ball upfield before there was any pressure on the ball.

Long-ball accuracy

The problem for opposing teams is that Brighton aren’t just one of the best possession-based and build-up teams in the league they are also one of the most efficient long-ball playing teams in the league.

The ability to play long balls accurately is an underrated trait we often don’t talk about that much with goalkeepers. It is far more common to hear about passing ability in tight areas but it is actually the accurate long balls (sometimes even just the threat of them being played) that puts pressure on the opposition sparks fear and hesitation in the defenders and opens up spaces short for the goalkeeper to pass into.

In the 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace at the end of September it was Sanchez’s ability to hit long and accurate balls to his forwards that caused problems. In the first half Sanchez’s near-75-yard ball bypassed 10 defensive players and set up a chance for Danny Welbeck.

Midway through the second half another long ball from Sanchez led to a chance. This time it was a side volley that split the Palace defence and found Moder free in the final third.

The margins on this ball were extremely slim and Sanchez hit it about as perfectly as you could.

For opposing teams to adapt to Brighton’s long-ball threat one of two things are likely to happen: the defending side will have everyone sit back deeper or bring extra players back as additional cover to help against the attacking players in their own half.

The issue that arises with each tactic is that the defending team inadvertently creates the desired space and favourable numbers that Brighton crave to play out of their own half and build up their possession game. It is quite a conundrum for opponents.

Aerial command

Sanchez’s confidence is also evident in how he handles long lofted balls deep into his box. A goalkeeper’s size and reach (both of which Sanchez has at 6ft 6in) can give them an advantage when dealing with high balls but more important than any physical trait is their positioning.

Proper positioning allows the goalkeeper to extend their range and minimise the distance between them and their defenders which crucially helps clarify the decision of when to come versus when to stay closer to your line. It also helps with your timing and being able to attack the ball at its highest point.

Sanchez has great hands exceptional footwork and timing and unwavering bravery when balls are pumped into his box.

The numbers back up just how good he has been. He leads the Premier League this season in rate of crosses stopped (19 per cent) total crosses stopped (15 from 79 chances already four more than the whole of last season) and high claims with 27 (Southampton’s Alex McCarthy has the second most with 16).

Although these statistics alone (high claims in particular) do not always tell the entire story about a player’s capabilities — considering the way a team plays and defends can impact how active they are required to be — the fact that he leads all three categories and has 11 more high claims compared to the next best goalkeeper in the league is significant and paints a clear picture about just how effective Sanchez has been.

A huge reason for his success stems from his aggressive starting position in open play and in set-piece situations which helps him own the space that eventually leads to shots.

Because of the way Brighton set up — they often hold possession for long periods of the game and commit several players into the attack — their goalkeeper needs to play a high line think proactively (one or two steps ahead of the play) and be able to snuff out attacks from the opposition rather than reacting and playing catch-up to the players in front of him.

Potter doesn’t just value his possession-based system due to the attacking principles they are also a core part of his defending concept at Brighton.

Even when Brighton don’t have the ball Sanchez’s aggressive positioning is key to the ideals. Potter has convinced his players that if they can keep a high line and relentlessly press the opposition then they have someone to protect behind them.

Additionally his high line gives confidence to the defence because they know that any pass in and around the box belongs to him. They can trust their own decisions more knowing that in the worst-case scenario Sanchez is there to clean up the danger.

Here are a few examples of Sanchez leaving his line and challenging to win the ball often amid a mix of team-mates and opposing players.

Pay particular attention to how far he is off his line when he claims each ball. It’s not uncommon to see a goalkeeper come and challenge for balls around their six-yard box but to see a goalkeeper consistently challenge for balls at (or even sometimes well past) his penalty spot is extraordinary. It is down to Sanchez’s high starting position.

Here he is making a tough catch in the 0-0 draw at Norwich.

And here Sanchez is in the same match catching the ball at its highest point despite pressure from two attacking players.

In this next image taken from Brighton’s 2-1 win at Burnley on the opening day of the season Sanchez makes a confident claim beyond his penalty spot this time to secure three vital points.

Here is Sanchez (below) claiming an outswinging corner kick from Liverpool last season to preserve the victory at Anfield.

And here he is against Burnley last season jumping up and over a sea of players to make an extraordinary claim near the edge of his box.

Making mistakes

This type of aggressive play doesn’t come without its drawbacks however. Leaving your line and launching yourself into crowds of people the way Sanchez does will naturally lead to mistakes and miscalculations from time to time.

Last season against Leicester Sanchez was punished when he rushed forward to attack an inswinging corner from Marc Albrighton and mistimed his punch leading to a free header at the back post for Daniel Amartey to win the game.

In the Burnley game this season Sanchez again rushed forward and got his timing all wrong resulting in a missed punch and a free header at the back post that fortunately hit the crossbar.

Even though it wasn’t a crossing situation the same can be said of Sanchez mishandling a high claim that led to Manchester City’s opener last month (below). The timing was correct on this occasion but his execution was just a little off.

The congestion around him the flight and pace of the ball (both of which weren’t ideal here as the ball was deflected and spinning) and the ball’s final destination — all of these factors can conspire to prevent a safe catch and make punching a better option. A good punch executed correctly — cleared high wide and away from danger — can be just as effective as a catch. It accomplishes the same result and allows a team to clear their zones and reset the defensive line.

Against City Gabriel Jesus’ physical perfectly timed challenge also made it more difficult generating enough contact to throw off the goalkeeper’s balance and interrupt his catch when he is exposed and vulnerable resulting in a dropped ball and a goal for City.

Overall Sanchez’s aggressiveness in crossing situations has been a huge asset to the goalkeeper and his team-mates despite him occasionally getting things wrong.

Positioning

In addition to the more modern skill set Sanchez is also a very good goalkeeper in the traditional sense.

His body shape and set position in particular are superb and serve as the foundations for the rest of his attributes.

His positional awareness and technical efficiency — mainly regarding his footwork — mean he doesn’t need to make any wild movements or technical adjustments as he traverses his goalmouth in preparation for each shot on target.

Advertisement

By the time the ball is struck he is already in the optimal position and has his body and hands are in the correct shape to make a save.

Here’s an example from the game against Spurs last season.

At his very best it is his agility and reflexes — specifically in the tightest areas — that really shine.

Although it is a goalkeeper’s footwork that gets them from point A to point B to save shots further away from the goal it is a keeper’s ability to change direction quickly that helps them make small adjustments to shots in the box at a moment’s notice.

Sanchez does the latter extremely well by keeping his footsteps small and almost in continuous contact with the ground giving him a strong centre of balance and allowing him to react and adjust in any direction.

Combined with a quick first step off his line Sanchez’s agility also makes him difficult to beat in one-v-one situations. His quick and direct movements help him shoot his limbs toward the ball at an alarming speed.

When the striker is free and clear on goal the Brighton goalkeeper remains patient keeping his chest/body square to the ball and holding his ground staying as big as possible up until the last moment before the shot.

In the time it takes for the striker to put his head down to shoot Sanchez closes the space between them and limits even the most narrow angles past him to the net.

He did just that against Foden in the game against Manchester City…

And also against Palace’s Wilfried Zaha…

Monster potential

After a man of the match performance against Burnley to extend Brighton’s unbeaten run to five matches last season Potter was quick to highlight Sanchez’s quality.

“Robert is a monster in terms of his physicality” Potter said. “He’s not just big but powerful too. He has everything to be a top goalkeeper.”

At 23 Sanchez is challenging what we thought was possible from a goalkeeper at such a young age.

As he furthers his craft in future seasons it is conceivable that he will continue to develop his game. Potter’s claim that Sanchez could go on to play for “pretty much any football club in the world” may well become a reality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGlkYWwuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lL2FydGljbGUvcm9iZXJ0LXRydWppbGxvLWluLWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi8xLTgxNTM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Moved by the energy”: Robert Trujillo in Conversation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://tidal.com/magazine/article/robert-trujillo-in-conversation/1-81535 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGlkYWwuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lL2FydGljbGUvcm9iZXJ0LXRydWppbGxvLWluLWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi8xLTgxNTM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGl0dHNidXJnaHNwb3J0c25vdy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8zMC9yb2JlcnQtbW9ycmlzLWNvbWVzLWZyb20tYmVoaW5kLXRvLWRlZmVhdC1oYW1wdG9uLTM4LTM1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Morris Comes from Behind to Defeat Hampton 38-35,"A Pittsburgh college football team led by a fifth-year senior at quarterback completed a second-half comeback today against a 3-4 football team at home.

The Robert Morris football team was down eight at halftime and later by eight with less than ten minutes left yet still managed to win the game 38-35 on a 38-yard field goal by Nick Bisceglia.

Prior to taking the lead at the end Robert Morris had only two leads in the entire game. Both were in the first half when they led 7-0 and later 10-7. When Hampton took the lead on a touchdown run by Jett Duffey with 7:44 left in the first half they held it until Robert Morris tied things up on a touchdown and two-point conversion with 3:01 left in the game.

“The last drive was our most confident as an offense” said Robert Morris quarterback George Martin. “When you play with guys for years now it’s been four years I’ve been with these guys you get the feeling that they’re all locked in. He’s fighting an injury and he’s fighting an injury but it doesn’t matter because if you’re that far locked in and know your assignment you know we can push the ball all the way down the field. It was great to see our guys that confident.”

The largest deficit that Robert Morris had to comeback from was when Hampton scored on their first drive of the second half. After that touchdown a Duffey 21-yard run Hampton took a 15-point lead. Robert Morris scored the next two touchdowns though to make the score 28-26 as they failed to convert on the two-point conversion on the latter of the two drives.

In the game there were 10 scoring drives of 60-yards or more between the two teams. Perhaps the player of the game was Duffey who set a stadium record five rushing touchdowns in a single game. Duffey had 84 rushing yards on 18 carries and had a 190.5 QBR. He completed 14 of his 20 passes for 287 yards in the game.

“Our O-line did a good job and held up well” said Clark. “The running attack the passing attack it all came together. The O-line gave George the time he needed to see guys. He’s a fifth-year senior and you know he’s always going to get it going eventually. He’s a second-half guy. That held true today.”

But it was the Robert Morris offense that ended up with more points in the end. They benefitted from a break-out performance by running back Alijah Jackson. Jackson had struggled throughout the season averaging just 2.8 yards per carry and 56.8 yards per game. The move to the Big South had been difficult for Jackson and the Robert Morris running game but Jackson had one of the best games of his career against Hampton.

Jackson almost doubled his season yards per carry average against Hampton. He averaged 5.1 yards per carry in the game and added a touchdown. He was only tackled for loss one time in the whole game just a one-yard loss too and he finished with 127 yards on 25 carries.

“We were running the ball effectively” said Martin. “The defense had to go back and decide what they wanted to defend and we just adjusted accordingly.”

Consistency from the quarterback position has been key in the victories for Robert Morris this season and the team got more of that from him today. George Martin threw for 315 yards and 2 touchdowns. He managed a 156.6 QBR while completing 28 of his 39 passes. He threw no interceptions as well.

Robert Morris improves to 3-4 (2-3) in their first full Big South conference season. They have yet to lose at home and have won all of those games by only one score. Robert Morris’s next game will be against Kennesaw State on November 6th. That game will be at home with a noon kick-off time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDE2Nzg1LXJvYmVydC1zYWxlaC1vbi1taWtlLXdoaXRlcy1mdXR1cmUtYXMtamV0cy1sb25nLXRlcm0tcWItYW55dGhpbmctaXMtcG9zc2libGXSAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly9zeW5kaWNhdGlvbi5ibGVhY2hlcnJlcG9ydC5jb20vYW1wLzEwMDE2Nzg1LXJvYmVydC1zYWxlaC1vbi1taWtlLXdoaXRlcy1mdXR1cmUtYXMtamV0cy1sb25nLXRlcm0tcWItYW55dGhpbmctaXMtcG9zc2libGUuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Saleh on Mike White's Future as Jets' Long-Term QB: 'Anything Is Possible',"AP Photo/Noah K. Murray

In his first career start New York Jets quarterback Mike White made a huge impression in Sunday's 34-31 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. So much so that it seems like Jets head coach Robert Saleh is open to the idea of White remaining the team's starter going forward.

When asked about White being the Jets' long-term answer at quarterback after the game Saleh told reporters ""anything is possible.""

White threw for 405 yards three touchdowns and two interceptions as New York improved to 2-5. He led the Jets on a touchdown drive to open Sunday's game for New York's first points in the first quarter this entire season. White's performance put him in some elite company.

White was starting in place of Jets rookie quarterback Zach Wilson who suffered a sprained PCL in Week 7 against the New England Patriots. The earliest Wilson is expected to return is Nov. 14 against the Buffalo Bills giving White at least one more start against the Indianapolis Colts on Thursday Night Football.

Drafted in the fifth round of the 2018 draft by the Dallas Cowboys White landed on the Jets' practice squad in 2019. He had been switched between New York's practice squad and active roster 11 times prior to Sunday's start.

The Jets offense looked more efficient under White as offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur called the game from the booth for the first time this year. LaFleur usually called the game from the sideline so he could be in direct communication with Wilson but he switched things up with White under center.

The Jets have longed for a solution at the quarterback position and they believed they found it when they drafted Wilson No. 2 overall in this year's draft. But Wilson has struggled through rookie growing pains throwing nine interceptions prior to his injury."

In the mid-90s the worldwide web was coming into common usage with the debut of eBay and email becoming a familiar everyday tool. Seinfeld ER and Friends were all the rage on TV and Bill Clinton was reelected President in 1996.

In Traverse City the ‘90s saw a host of developments changes and newsworthy events and The Ticker explores all in our third and final Sunday lookback.

Grand Traverse Mall and the Horizon Outlet Mall opened in 1992. The National Cherry Festival was named a Top Ten Event by USA Today in 1997 ‘98 and ‘99. And in the last year of the decade the Traverse Area District Library opened its doors welcoming readers to its new location on Woodmere.

It was a quarter century ago that the State Theatre closed its doors. The screen remained dark at the downtown fixture for over a decade. During that time it was purchased by Barry Cole and the State Theatre Group with plans to convert it into a performing arts complex. Seven years later the State Theatre Group and Interlochen Center for the Arts announced a partnership to renovate the theater. The building wound up in the hands of Rotary Charities which donated the theater to the Traverse City Film Festival in May 2007.

Big box stores arrived in Traverse City in 1996 with the opening of the Grand Traverse Crossings shopping center on South Airport Road across from Grand Traverse Mall. Today Home Depot Walmart and Staples remain there; Toys R Us Office Depot and Borders Books are gone.

In 1996 Mike and Denise Busley opened the first Grand Traverse Pie Company. The two were tired of their corporate lives in San Diego and after visiting meeting and working with the owner of Julian Pie Company in Julian California they returned to their home state. The first Grand Traverse Pie shop opened July 19 with six employees. It added other bakery items and a café in 2000. Today there are 15 Grand Traverse Pie shops scattered across Michigan and Indiana with more than 300 “pie people.”

It was also in 1996 that Rick and Lori Dubro purchased Papa J’s & Roosters Chicken in Grawn. They changed it from carry out and delivery to a full service sit-down restaurant. Today their Rico’s Cafe’ uses the same pizza recipe as the one Dubro and high school friend Tom Griffin used when they purchased their first restaurant a pizzeria in Roseville in 1978.

Another downtown landmark found new ownership when the Traverse City Rotary Club sold the Park Place to Regency Inns Management Inc. of Sioux Falls S.D. and Milestone Hotel Investments of Minneapolis Minnesota that year. Rotary had used funds from its Rotary Charities operations to buy the hotel at a bankruptcy court auction sale six years prior and had reopened in 1991 after a year-long top-to-bottom renovation. Regency Hotel Management still owns the Park Place today; its own multi-million dollar renovation completed in 2018 included a 16000-square-foot addition and the removal of the famed dome.

Centre Ice opened in 1997 and has been going strong ever since helped by the Detroit Red Wings choice to hold the team’s pre-season hockey training camp there starting that same year.

Fires became major stories in the mid-90s. In 1994 a fire broke out in a pizza shop in the Hickory Corners plaza on Fourteenth Street. Despite the efforts of the Traverse and Elmwood Township Fire Departments the wind-driven fire destroyed the entire building.

The biggest story – and largest fire – erupted when a tire-shredding machine at Carl's Retreading in Grawn ignited nearby scrap tires on Dec. 29 1996. The tires were piled as high as 30 feet high in some areas and the smoke was visible for miles as some 750000 tires burned for weeks reaching temperatures above 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. Nearby neighborhoods were evacuated.

Multiple fire departments responded and the National Guard was eventually called in as well. Initial efforts to put the fire out used Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) but when that proved ineffective the fire was sprayed down with water and the burning tires were buried. The effects linger today as the foam left behind a PFAS plume which impacted nearby wells. Some affected homes have been connected to the Blair Township water system.

In January 1996 the region stepped into the nascent world of craft beer when Jack Archiable opened Traverse Brewing Company in Williamsburg. It was the seventh licensed craft brewery in the state (there are now more than 300) and it produced the first beer brewed in northern Michigan since prohibition. Many of the area’s leading lights in the brewing industry worked there including Brewery Terra Firma founder John Niedermaier Joe Short of Short’s Brewing Company and Russell Springsteen who would go on to found Right Brain Brewery.

Not far behind Mackinaw Brewing Company the city’s first brewpub opened in 1997. North Peak Brewing Company soon followed.

They are both homeware shops a few miles apart on the outskirts of Ross-on-Wye and even share a name.

Yet Baileys DIY and Bailey's Home might as well be on different planets in terms of shopping experience.

Why? Well one makes you wonder if that £2.99 tin of Rustic Rosemary spray paint can revive that rusty table in the garden the other convinces you that you want to spend over £1000 on an even rustier garden table to replace it.

Read more: We checked out Bailey's DIY and found elastic walls but no frills

Bailey's Home makes you lust after rust whine over old pine and sing the praises of string. And I'm not the only one.

Apparently they have inspired a generation of home creators with their pared-back modern rustic vibe and idiosyncratic style.

This crack cocaine of homeware shops can actually convince you that you that your life is not complete without a £220 large chopping board in the kitchen.

Under normal circumstances the idea of someone paying more than a tenner for something to chop the carrots on would have had me squealing about the emperor's new clothes.

But the way old wood is displayed in the wonderful converted barn at Bailey's Home can bring on a serous case of the 21st century ""bucolic plague"" an addiction to rustic.

Why else would someone who never bakes swoon over a £12 wooden spoon? It's the only place in the world that could make paying £245 continental quilt cover seem reasonable. (It's got a zillion thread count you know.)

And judging by the reaction of other customers desperately trying to keep their credit cards in their bags they must sell a lot of those pretty home made soaps displayed in delightful vintage cabinets to shoppers who want to bring a little bit of Bailey's home with them.

Down the road at the Baileys DIY you could practically fill a trolley for the price of a plant pot in Baileys Home as long as you wanted to buy coca cola or gallon cartons of washing up liquid.

People come from all over to 'stock up' and are looking for cheap rather than chic. The Bailey family give it to them by the palletload. They also do cheerful in spades.

Yet despite being worlds apart the Baileys have more in common than a name.

The owners: both are family firms

Married couple Mark and Sally Bailey started their emporium nearly forty years ago and moved from small premises in Ross-on-Wye to the nearby village of Bridstow as word spread and the business grew. What started out as an architectural antiques business expanded to include homewares and Mark a craftsman a designer artist and furniture maker now tours the world looking for exclusive stock.

The Baileys DIY family also started in business decades ago with a garage and a few petrol pumps in Abergavenny. In 2012 they bought a local DIY business which had a satellite store near Ross-on-Wye and then moved to the outskirts of town.

What they sell

Both have an ever changing collection of eclectic goods to buy.

Bailey's Home sell everything from garden tables and tin baths to sofas and string. Top quality furniture tableware clothing lighting textiles food and antiques that make you want to clear everything out of your house and start again.

You can actually see how weighty those wood and metal products are just by looking at them and everything is so tactile you want to stroke it.

Bailey's DIY sell everything from pet food to wicker baskets and Christmas decorations but are becoming best known for their wholesale food and drink offering which covers every fizzy pop on the market and the odd luxury brand such as Green and Blacks.

Unlike Bailey's Home which has shelves groaning with French epicurean delights Bailey's DIY seem to favour British sweet and savoury goods and local produce ie stacks of Weston's Cider from Much Marcle.

Setting

Bailey's Home is housed in a collection of beautifully restored agricultural buildings with old wooden beams lime plaster and rough concrete and metal.

Once owned by the Duchy of Cornwall it is surrounded by lush countryside and reached through large gates and a gravel drive.

Bailey's DIY is in the old Focus warehouse on the outskirts of town and next to the well known Ross Labels outlet and what used to be the cattle market.

Ambience

Bailey's DIY is very much stack 'em high and sell 'em cheap. Don't expect artfully arranged goods or pretty settings to show them off just aisle upon aisle crammed with whatever is going cheap on any given day.

Basically it is a metal box with concrete floors and much of the stock never makes it off the pallet or out of the plastic wrapping.

Bailey's Home is carefully curated so they have whetted your appetite with vintage garden furniture by the time you walk through the door of the cosy barn where you are likely to be met with the whiff of jasmine candles and the sound of gentle jazz.

Social media

Bailey's Home had their look nailed well before Instagram and Pinterest created so many copycats. The couple have written four books on interiors so they know the importance of beautiful photographsif you want to sell a dream. There's a reason why they appear on the glossy pages of so many high end interiors magazines.

Cheeky Matt Bailey is becoming a bit of a Facebook star as he welcomes HGVs to the store and gives fans a sneak preview of what is on the pallets being delivered.

Dressed in shorts padded gilet and white socks with trainers he gives customers a humorous tour of what star bargains are on the shelves.

Prices

Bailey's Home is the type of place where you think the wooden price tag is saying £5.60 for a single dried flower until you realise it's £560 for the large Ethiopian container they are displayed in.

The type of place that leaves my husband shaking his head in disbelief at the price of 'lived-in charm' that he thinks belongs on a tip because peeling paintwork is plain scruffy and the expensive 'vintage' wooden box is firewood.

Yet many of the goods that are comparable with high street prices. A French antique glass lampshade was not much more than you would pay for a modern one if you shopped at John Lewis rather than Matalan for instance. Twenty years ago I bought a bathroom suite that was cheaper than B&Q.

At Baileys DIY they aim to be ""cheap as chips"". you can get three packets of biscuits for 89p a mug for a few quid and enough pop to keep a pub going over Christmas for a fiver.

There's also an aisle of rustic and shabby chic homeware so you can come out feeling chuffed you picked up something nice and affordable for the house. Ok it might not be 200 years old but it's nice.

The Customers

In a nutshell country types.

Baileys DIY have the kind of customer that has straw in their hair when they pull up in a trailer to buy giant bags of cheap food for working dogs. There's also welly wearers looking for something for the horse or garden people in work clothes looking at tools and ordinary families browsing cheap food and debating Dulux paint shades.

The country types at Baileys Home dress like Monty Don and take expensive linen cushions into the light outside to make sure they are the perfect shade of taupe to complement the Farrow and Ball Elephants Breath.They are kind of people who think tea towels normally cost £12 and spend small fortune on a kitchen table on a whim.

But it's also a ""destination shop"" filled with wannabees who wander around in pairs thinking nobody can see them raising their eyebrows to attract each other's attention while silently nodding at the price tags and then buying a candle before scurrying off to HomeSense gossiping about the prices.

The staff

There seems to be a lot of staff floating about the various rooms in Bailey's Home but you don't notice them because they wear lovely pinnies that blend in with the muted linens draped all around the place.

The staff in Bailey's DIY wear black fleeces and always seem really busy stacking shelves or making sure nobody ""half hinches"" the tools. The ones on the till always seem cheerful and chatty.

What they say:

Mark and Sally also have their our own workshops at the farm and work with small family run factories and makers throughout Britain and Europe.

The blurb for their book The Imperfect Home says they embrace ""the picturesque beauty of peeling paint vintage fabric time-worn colours handmade items and obscure treasures"" but mix them with modern pieces to add vitality colour and contrast.

""We like to think that we stock items that are different to those on the high street. We have worked really hard over the years producing homewares that we have designed ourselves and had made for us which we like to mix with antique furniture and fixtures.”

Matt Bailey often boasts they are the number one clearance centre in England because they have become the go to place for manufacturers passing on goods nearing their sell by date.

They say: ""Baileys DIY is owned and run by the local Bailey family who have been in business in the area for over 45 years.

""Shop for your essential supplies here we are open 7 days a week. Wholesale suppliers of our ever growing discount and clearance range. Including cleaning pet food sweets soft drinks crisps chocolate and alcohol.

What we say:

Both Baileys are clever because they give customers what they want and although they are at completely opposite ends of the spectrum they are priced accordingly.

The big question is would all those lovely textiles and kitchenwear and garden bric a brac at Bailey's Home be as desirable or command such high price tags if they were thrown on shelves at Baileys DIY?

Changing shops would be an interesting experiment ....

After releasing its quarterly financials a trio of Royal Caribbean Group executives took questions from investment firms about the company's health. Included on the call were:

Royal Caribbean Group Chairman and CEO Richard Fain

Royal Caribbean Group Chief Financial Officer Jason Liberty

Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley

While the call primarily dealt with discussing fiscal health and the financial outlook some answers gave operational insight that is of interest to cruise ship guests.

Royal Caribbean prioritized ships back in service over capacity

There was a conscientious effort by Royal Caribbean to get more cruise ships back in service first over trying to max out how full the ships were.

Anyone who went on a cruise this summer and fall definitely noticed the limited capacity onboard which was almost always well before half full.

Mr. Fain talked about why they wanted more ships back sooner ""Like the pilot of a plane during takeoff prioritizing speed over altitude we have prioritized spreading the wealth.""

""We have prioritized starting up more ships even with lower loads per vessel rather than trying for higher load factors on fewer ships. We have been executing this in a financially and medically prudent manner.""

He pointed out that in January 2022 the major booking season for cruise begins and Royal Caribbean Group wants their core markets operating normally as quickly as possible. He believes with as many ships as they have ready to go in January this will position the company well financially.

""That will put us in an excellent position to have a good wave period. Our bookings are already showing that the public has a great deal of pent up demand and is eager to travel again. We have a long period of poor bookings to make up for but current booking trends give us a high level of confidence for 2022 especially from the summer on.""

Royal Caribbean has been quietly increasing the capacity of its ships even as early as October as evidenced by cruise passengers who reported seeing sailings with more than 50% capacity.

During the call Mr. Bayley mentioned Freedom of the Seas sailed at 85% occupancy.

""We've brought back significantly more capacity ships beds and berths than any of our competitors by a significant amount. And what that means is that operationally and logistically we've already climbed over that mountain and we've now got a large number of our assets available for booking. And more importantly we've now gone through and absorbed all of those expenses.""

So when might Royal Caribbean truly get back to full capacity across the board?

Mr. Liberty said somewhere around summer 2022 is the plan for now ""We are kind of preparing our business to maximize our revenues and profitability in this very kind of lucrative peak summer season.""

Future of protocols

One of the major obstacles to get more customers back on cruise ships are the Covid-19 protocols that are necessary right now either as mandated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or by the cruise line. So when will those change?

One investor asked Royal Caribbean how they were thinking about vaccine mandates across different age demographics into next year.

In replying Mr. Bayley provided a glimpse into Royal Caribbean's relationship with the CDC as well as when protocols could change.

""I think what's what's happened over this past several months is that we've really got a a focused collaborative effort and we found the relationship with the CDC has been very constructive.""

""While the CSO comes to a kind of a technical end on January the 15th we will continue our ongoing collaboration with the CDC in terms of the protocols that will voluntarily operate after the CSO expires.""

""They certainly and we want to make sure that we're operating safely and they're also well aware that some of the protocols that we have in place will naturally fall away as the pandemic moves further and further in the rearview mirror.""

""I think as we move into '22 hopefully what we'll see is is the protocols become easier and less cumbersome for our customers.""

World Cruise selling extremely well

Royal Caribbean announced its first world cruise to sail in 2023 and if you were wondering who would realistically book a 9 month cruise that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars the answer was clearly a lot of people.

Within the first 10 days the cruise was only bookable by repeat cruise guests and Mr. Bayley indicated already it is 70% booked.

""Within seven days we were 70 percent booked and the average price of a balcony room is $75000 for the balcony. The Royal Suite sold within a week at $760000 and all of these suites have booked with non-refundable deposit.""

Mr. Bayley admitted they were surprised how well it sold ""Even we were taken aback by the unbelievable response of our royalty customers. The fact that within a week we were 70 percent booked on a ship that carries around 2100 guests and is on a nine month world cruise was just remarkable and I think that's indicative of what we're we're seeing.""

Port project update

One investor asked Royal Caribbean for an update on its port projects that it had announced before the pandemic.

Mr. Bayley reiterated some of the short term projects that are still moving ahead ""We did obviously have a plan in place. Pre-pandemic we pressed pause. We're now re-engaging on all of those plans in the immediate future.""

Hideaway Beach

""We have an expansion taking place in perfect day with the addition of Hideaway Beach which is a new experience that will open in late '22 for Perfect Day.""

""The beauty of Hideaway Beach is that it is an adult only area as part of Perfect Day. It will allow us to increase our capacity by approximately 3000 people a day in late 22 which is you know obviously going to help improve our overall profitability and drive more more revenue both both ticket and on board.""

Nassau Beach Club

""We're close to finalizing the design and construction plans and the approvals for Beach Club in Nassau which were we're hoping to start work on that very soon.""

Galveston terminal

""We've got a Galveston terminal that's opening in '22 and that will accommodate our Oasis class ships and then future Icon. And of course that gives us remarkable access into the Texas Oklahoma and that whole region as a market for drive into.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1mdWxsLWZsZWV0LWluLXExLWZ1bGwtc2hpcHMtYnktcTMtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean: Full Fleet in Q1 Full Ships by Q3 2022,"Royal Caribbean Group on Friday told investors that it expects to have full load factors across a fully operating cruise fleet by the third quarter of 2022 adding that it expects to be cash flow positive by spring and profitable for the full year 2022.

By the end of 2021 the cruise brand said it expects 50 out of 61 ships to have returned to service representing almost 100% of core itinerary capacity and approximately 80% of worldwide capacity.

The remaining ships are expected to return by the spring of 2022 and return to historical load factors in the third quarter 2022 the company said in its third quarter earnings release.

The Cruise with Confidence program has been extended until Spring of next year.

The program was first introduced last year on March 6 2020 and gives guests far more flexibility to cancel cruises after final payment was due and introduces a shorter time window when the cruise line expects the final payment to be made. Another change the cruise line has introduced is the extension of the COVID-19 Assistance Program.

Cruise with Confidence Extended

Guests will be happy to note that cruises onboard the Royal Caribbean ships can now be booked without having to worry about additional penalties if they need to cancel. The program allows guests to cancel their voyage up to 48 hours before departure and still receive a Future Cruise Credit.

The Cruise with Confidence program has now been extended for bookings confirmed on or before December 17 2021 which depart through April 30 2022. Qualifying guests can also take advantage of the Best Price Guarantee up to 48-hours before sailing which ensures they get the best deal if prices have changed since the time of their booking.

Guests should keep in mind that if they do not opt-in for the Cruise with Confidence future cruise credit the original terms and conditions will continue to apply. By requesting a Cruise with Confidence FCC guests also lose the right to receive any refund of the monies they paid for these cruises even if the cruise line decides to cancel the voyage at a later date.

Final Payment Extension

The second change that Royal Caribbean announced on its website is the possibility for guests to postpone their final cruise payment until 30 days before sailing. This option is available for all guests with bookings that depart before March 31 2022.

The final payment extension option will be a welcome break for guests who are unsure about their cruise just yet and want to see what options are available closer to their sail date. It also allows guests to wait and see what health protocols will be in place before their departure. Ordinarily guests need to make final payments for their cruise at least 90-days out.

COVID-19 Assistance Program Also Extended

Lastly Royal Caribbean also made changes to its COVID-19 Assistance program. This has been extended for all vaccinated guests and children who are not yet eligible for vaccination until April 30 2022.

Guests will have peace of mind should they test positive from 14 days before the cruise; they can cancel and still receive a full 100% refund of the cruise fare. This includes being tested positive before the cruise or while at the terminal.

And even when guests are on board there will be options within the assistance program. This includes a pro-rated cruise fare refund if your cruise is cut short for reasons related to COVID-19.

If you do test positive during your cruise under the program Royal Caribbean covers the costs of COVID-19 related medical treatment onboard. Land-based quarantine and travel home for you and your traveling party are also included.

With the confidence that Royal Caribbean showed in its third-quarter results released on October 29 it is clear the cruise line is looking forward to the future positively. It now needs to instill that same confidence in its guests. While they have already done exactly that since the start of cruising the extension of the Cruise With Confidence program will only strengthen it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8zMS9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tcG9zdC1yb3VuZC1vY3RvYmVyLTMxLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean Post Round-Up: October 31 2021,"Happy Halloween!

The cruise industry got mostly good news this week when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced it temporarily extended the Conditional Sailing Order.

The CDC announced a temporary extension of the rules and requirements for cruise ships through January 15 2022.

While the cruise industry has an additional few months of regulation the CDC intends to transition to a voluntary program in January giving the cruise lines a bit more flexibility.

How to plan a Royal Caribbean cruise on any budget

Royal Caribbean cruises are affordable vacations for guests of pretty much any budget which makes them an attractive way to vacation.

Whether you are going all out counting every last penny or looking for a reasonable value there are options that should fit into any family spending plan.

Here is a look at tips and tricks for how to plan a memorable cruise vacation on a low moderate and high budget.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL2F6YW1hcmEtcy1mbGVldC1jb21lcy11bmRlci12LXNoaXBzLWxlaXN1cmUtcy1zaGlwLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Azamara’s Fleet Comes Under V.Ships Leisure’s Ship Management,"Azamara’s four-ship luxury fleet is now under the ship management of V.Ships Leisure which has assumed all technical oversight crewing and port operations according to Per Bjornsen CEO V.Ships Leisure.

After private equity firm Sycamore Partners’ acquisition of Azamara from the Royal Caribbean Group earlier this year the Azamara Onward entered V.Ships’ management following the ship’s acquisition while the company brought the Quest into management on October 23 the Pursuit on October 28 and the Journey on October 31.

Detailed Way

“We’ve been through the plan in the most detailed way to ensure there is no change to the guest experience. That has been the core” said Bjornsen noting that while it is rare to decouple brands from a major cruise group V.Ships has done it several times.

Taking over four sister ships the crew will stay the same but be managed by V.Ships while other new systems have been put in place.

“We are moving toward more data driven management for planned maintenance for example” Bjornsen told Cruise Industry News. “The data is being migrated to our platform ShipSure which is the digital platform in center of everything we do. There has been detailed planning with Azamara Royal Caribbean Group and our team to make this smooth.”

“There has been thorough planning of crewing the procurement hand over and customization of the safety management system – making sure there are no gaps compared to the service which was provided previously. However we see this as a greenfield opportunity to do things smarter.”

Four Ships

“When you have the opportunity to have four sister ships it’s quite interesting what you can do comparing the fleet how you operate and sharing best practices. There is a tremendous amount of data and if you use it cleverly you can move towards predictive maintenance” Bjornsen explained.

Moving to V.Ships Azamara has access to a global network of offices purchasing power and redundancy of resources.

“It’s important that we share the same culture” Bjornsen said of Azamara’s and Sycamore’s relationship with V.Ships. “Safety is the number one priority and we are going into this with a long-term horizon working together as partners.”"

Duke University/Instagram Jerry Seinfeld gives the commencement address at Duke University on May 12 2024

Jerry Seinfeld has some apologies to offer nearly two decades after the release of Bee Movie.

On Sunday May 12 the Seinfeld alum 70 gave a commencement address to the graduating seniors at Duke University in Durham North Carolina — where his son Julian currently attends and his daughter Sascha previously graduated from.

During his speech the comedian took time to reflect on his 2007 animated film Bee Movie — specifically one controversial element of the storyline.

""I made a cartoon movie about bees you may have watched as a child"" Seinfeld said in a video captured by an attendee and shared on TikTok.

""If any of you felt slightly uncomfortable about the sexual undertones in the relationship between Barry B. Benson and Vanessa the florist who saves his life I would like to apologize for that now"" he continued earning laughs from the crowd. ""I may not have calibrated that perfectly.""

Fans of the DreamWorks kids' movie have previously made long-running jokes about the romantic tension between Seinfeld's character in the film Barry (a bee) and Renée Zellweger's character Vanessa (a human). Back in October 2021 Seinfeld addressed the same issue during an appearance on The Tonight Show apologizing once again for the innuendo.

""I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie"" he said at the time. ""[It] really was not intentional but after it came out I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl and we don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children’s entertainment.""

Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke also drew public attention when anti-war protesters walked out of the ceremony and booed from the audience when the TV star took the podium according to NBC News and CBS News.

Seinfeld has been making a slew of public appearances in recent weeks in support of his newest movie Unfrosted which marks his feature-film directorial debut. Speaking with PEOPLE at the premiere of the movie on April 30 Seinfeld opened up about taking on the role of director for the first time in his career.

""You don't want to think about that this is a really big important job. Like the pilot never wants to come on the PA system and go 'I'm going to try and get this plane in the air.' You have to be confident"" he said.

Seinfeld previously told PEOPLE that he has ""been obsessed with Pop-Tarts my whole life"" which is what inspired him to take on the movie.

""My friend Spike Feresten who was a writer on my show and is still a good friend of mine thought we should make a movie out of the story the real story which we did"" he explained.



Unfrosted — which features a star-studded cast including Melissa McCarthy Jim Gaffigan Hugh Grant and more — is set in 1963 Battle Creek Mich. when ""Kellogg's and Post sworn cereal rivals race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever"" according to a synopsis.

It is worth noting that then Kings XI Punjab pacer Sreesanth and former Mumbai Indians captain Harbhajan Singh had a heated altercation during a match between the two sides. Harbhajan slapped Sreesanth and the latter ended up crying. The action saw Harbhajan facing a ban from the rest of the tournament in that edition. While speaking on 'The Ranveer Show' Sreesanth said that he didn't cry because of the pain but the bond he has had with Harbhajan.

""If you look at it it was a 30-second video or something but media showed it as if..."" said Sreesanth before the host added that it became the biggest IPL news. ""Yeah yeah. Unbelievable. So I will say Bhajji pa. Even now I address him as 'Bhajji pa' and he is somebody who is always... Whenever I had any important spell or something I was not doing well I used to go and hug Bhajji pa. And somehow it is the vibration or maybe the positivity which paaji has got I always used to get the performance out.

""So when that incident happened I was shocked. I didn't cry because of pain but because of heart. I could not take the fact that he would do it and I was not worried about who was watching. So maybe the kid in me as a younger brother if an elder brother was shouting and he had all the right because before the game he had actually told me that don't go overboard with your aggression against us.""

Sreesanth also made a huge revelation about his time with the national team.

""All my life I have been.... I can say it. See anything below Bombay was more like Madrasi. I have been hearing it from the time I was playing Under-13 to Under-14 to Under-16 to Under-19. Then we had the Kochi (Tuskers Kerala) team and it was like playing for the country again"" he said."

The day of action which took place in at least 100 cities around the world was timed ahead of COP26 the United Nations climate conference beginning in Glasgow on Sunday.

The Bank on Our Future campaign says that stopping the funding of asset managers like BlackRock would help stop the flow of funding for oil and gas.

At least 200 kids left school in a climate strike joined by survivors of wildfires across the state and Indigenous leaders.

“I think it’s very popular” said Newton resident Amanda Yu. “People [want to] come here.”

Tatte is not just another cafe conglomerate. Through the around-the-clock laboring of its founder Tzurit Or a self-taught pastry chef from Israel who stepped down as CEO of the company in July 2020 the company made its start locally through a Brookline location in 2007 according to its website.

Tatte which has now expanded beyond Brookline operates out of 18 Boston-area locations another four in metropolitan Washington D.C. and as of Wednesday a new one in Newton Centre according to the website.

Aside from its made-to-order items Tatte sells dozens of baked goods ranging from puffy classics like the croissants to Israeli-inspired items like a Spinach Labneh pita. Its drink menu also rivals the likes of any coffee shop.

An iced vanilla latte at the bakery is what you want it to be. Espresso flavors while rich do not overtake subtle splashes of real vanilla flavors. It costs just 50 cents more than the Starbucks alternative.

The Newton Tatte is sandwiched between a Sherwin-Williams Paint Store and the ramen restaurant Little Big Diner in an urban nook of the village. The bakery joins a crowded field of nine cafes in Newton Centre.

While Tatte offers its customers a nice sit-down environment it is the kind of restaurant where you are unsure how to tip. Customers order their food at the up-front register then pick up their coffee and finally find a table where the food is brought out to them.

“It’s definitely not just a coffee shop” Alex Thill a Newton resident who learned about the new location through a neighbor said. “But it’s also not a restaurant you know. They don’t necessarily have a … ‘sit down and someone takes your order’ [kind of atmosphere].”

Rich coffee-shop aromas modern furnishing and the over 20 staff members flooding the cafe at a time make the space feel mature. Overall Yu said she liked her experience at the new location but that it might not be the best space for little ones.

“I think it’s good like without kids” Yu said. “I don’t know if we bring kids here if it would be the same experience.”

Similar in style to the other Tatte locations the high top chairs monochrome black and white paints and big pane windows make the cafe feel as new as it is. That newness is also reflected

in the quality of service Newton resident Elle Nolan said.

“They’re super busy” Nolan said. “It felt slow but kind of methodical.”

Nolan said she fell in love with Tatte’s food long before the new location’s grand opening.

Tatte’s menu feels global. French toast and scrambled egg plates anchor the offerings. The three shakshuka options a North African dish allow customers to explore beyond breakfast basics.

The Mezze breakfast also adds a worldly dimension to the menu. The plate includes a cashew-pepper spread a potent whipped feta and za’atar spread and a grounding sunflower spread. Additionally customers are able to order eggs cooked any way with a sesame-crusted Jerusalem bagel to use with the dip and a tomato salad. Customers can rest assured that the poached eggs if selected will be cooked to poppable perfection.

Nolan’s favorite dish at Tatte is a potato mushroom and onion flatbread. The bakery did not have the flatbread on Friday but did the day before according to Nolan.

The puffy dough is stuffed with semi-sweet caramelized onions potatoes and mushrooms Nolan said.

“The potato gives like a really nice texture to it all even though they’re not super flavorful” Nolan said. “Mushrooms are kind of my favorite thing so it sort of rounds everything out.”

Yu new to the neighborhood also said she enjoyed the food at Tatte. Her and her partner got brunch at the bakery and topped things off with croissants she said.

“We didn’t have too much experience here but to compare my past experience in Texas–we moved from there—this is definitely above average” Yu said.

Management from the new Tatte directed The Heights to contact corporate for comment on the opening of the new location. Corporate did not respond to The Heights’ request for an interview.

It sells houses faster and for more money; paint a bathroom this color and you can safely expect offers that are higher than expected. And yet you soon may have trouble sourcing the color blue for your paint ideas.

Blue paint is the latest unexpected shortage to hit the consumer market continuing the bizarre list of items that have been difficult to get hold of from building materials to swimming pool chlorine. So if you're set on blue room ideas this season you may find it difficult to find blue paint depending on your chosen brand and shade.

(Image credit: Future/Adrian Briscoe)

Why is there a blue paint shortage?

As with other product supply issues this year there is more than one factor at play. The biggest problem is the shortage of some of the additives used in making blue paint specifically. A spokesperson from Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel told Insider that 'to make paint you would need between 50 and 60 ingredients' and some are 'extremely difficult to get' at the moment. This includes the color tint used to make blue paint.

Then there is the problem of the rising costs of raw materials. The cost of making paint has increased by over $323 million in just one year because of these rising costs.

And to add insult to injury paint manufacturers are having trouble sourcing the tinplate necessary for making the metal cans so that paint cans have to be shipped from one location to another to coat them.

The result? A shortage that the company says will last well into 2022. And it's not just the Dutch manufacturer that's been affected. Sherwin-Williams is experiencing similar problems. The company's CEO told CNN that 'the persistent and industry-wide raw material availability constraints and pricing inflation we have previously reported have worsened and we do not expect to see improved supply or lower raw material pricing in our fourth quarter as anticipated.'

Can I still buy blue paint?

It's highly unlikely that there won't be any blue paint left but you may notice that some shades of blue are temporarily out of stock. According to Akzo Nobel this is a 'transient situation' that should be resolved in six to nine months.

What you may notice is the rising cost of paint and that won't just apply to blue paint colors as companies experiencing shortages are likely to rise all their paint prices.",,,,,,,,,

All three sets are meant to be used to expand your starter course rather than be standalone sets and they seemingly don't include Luigi himself only his devilish device the Poltergust. You can however get your own Professor E Gadd and – perhaps best of all – your own special King Boo.

They were averaging less than six points a game and only scored more than 10 points only once this season. St. Cloud’s two wins have come against teams with a combined 3-15 record.

“To be honest I wasn’t really optimistic coming into the game. We were getting a great effort every week but between personnel issues Covid-tracing problems no returning starters on offense and other issues we have just been over-matched” Smart said. “Our kids just gave us a tremendous effort tonight.”

Both teams started off slow but Wyatt Castellucci would stake St. Cloud to a 3-0 lead with a 37-yard field goal midway through the second period. Harmony would make the first of the “little mistakes” that Simon talked about when they failed to cover the ensuing pooch kick. Freshman Tyler Green recovered and six plays later Ryan Clancy ran it over from four for a 10-0 St. Cloud lead.

A Tyler Emans touchdown run cut the lead to 10=7 but St. Cloud answered immediately as Julian Nasco took a reverse pitch on the very next play and ran 80 yards untouched for a score and a 17-7 lead. They would extend the lead to 24-7 as Clancy would recover an Emans’ fumble and then score his second rushing touchdown four plays later on a 4-yard scoring run.

Harmony would rally.

Getting the ball back with just 15 second remaining in the half sophomore quarterback Ayden Parks hit Isaiah Oquendo on a 41-yard touchdown pass to make it 24-14 at the half. Harmony would then come up with a turnover leading to a short Emans touchdown run to make it a 24-21 game midway through the third period.

After a stop by the Harmony defense the St. Cloud defense made perhaps the play of the game when it stuffed Cooper Richards for no gain on a third and goal from the two. Although a short Kevin Lavigne field goal made it 24-24 it kept St. Cloud even.

“We gave up that long touchdown right before half threw a pick that led to a score and on the next possession they were knocking on the door step to take the lead” Smart said. “Holding them to a field goal was huge. The game was full of momentum swings and that was one of them.”

St. Cloud would take the lead for good on the next possession. King a freshman would convert a third and 20 by throwing a 25-yard pass to former starting quarterback Jaden Morehead. One play later he would hit Morehead on a 41-yard touchdown pass to put the Bulldogs ahead 31-24.

The teams would then trade possessions with Harmony taking over on the St. Cloud 40. A false start pushed them back to the 45 but Harmony would hand the ball off to Emans on four straight carries and he would cap the drive with a 4-yard touchdown run to cut the lead to 31-30. But the errant snap on the extra point kept it a one-point game.

Harmony would fail to recover an on-sides kick but would force a punt with 41 seconds remaining. Castellucci one of many heroes on the night for St. Cloud would deliver a 54-yard kick down the Harmony 10 to clinch the win.

Castellucci was one of many heroes on the night for St. Cloud. King completed seven of 15 passes for 118 yards and a touchdown. Clancy recovered the fumble and had two rushing touchdowns. Morehead caught nine passes for 100 yards and a score 135-lb. senior running back Anthony Morales ran for 51 tough yards on 13 carries sophomore Nasco rushed for 89 yards and scored a touchdown.

“We had four freshman starters and everyone contributed tonight but this was a game for our seniors” Smart said. “Jaden Morehead is an incredible athlete who was playing quarterback and got hurt. When he came back he was just too valuable not to have on the field somewhere. He made so many big plays tonight. So did Ryan Clancy so did Matt Clukey so did Anthony Morales.”

Harmony was not without its stars. Despite losing two fumbles Emans ran for 179 yards and scored three touchdowns. Cooper Richards ran for 66 yards on just on 10 carries and other than two big scoring plays Harmony’s defense played well. Take away the touchdown plays of 80 and 41 yards the Longhorns defense allowed just 112 net offensive yards on 46 plays.

Three of the four Longhorns losses this season have been by one score or less. “This was a tough loss but we still have a chance for a winning record this season” Simon added. “We have a chance to finish with a winning record so this will be a gut check for us this week.”

St. Cloud wraps up its season next week with a road game against Winter Springs (1-7); while Harmony also takes to the road against New Smyrna Beach (6-3).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vY2VsZWJ3ZWxsLmNvbS9uZXdzLWdhYnJpZWxsZS11bmlvbi1zd2ltc3VpdC1zbmFwLWR3eWFuZS13YWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gabrielle Union Shares Swimsuit Snap with Dwyane Wade,"Gabrielle Union is still cruising into the final weeks of summer.

Blue Raiders are heading back home. The Blue Raiders and the Southern Miss Golden Eagles will face off in a Conference USA battle at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday at Johnny (Red) Floyd Stadium. Middle Tenn. should still be riding high after a big victory while Southern Miss will be looking to right the ship.

After constant struggles on the road Middle Tenn. has finally found some success away from home. They made easy work of the Connecticut Huskies last week and carried off a 44-13 win. The contest was all but wrapped up at the end of the third by which point Middle Tenn. had established a 34-13 advantage. It was another big night for their QB Chase Cunningham who passed for four TDs and 297 yards on 36 attempts.

Special teams collected 14 points for Middle Tenn. K Zeke Rankin delivered a perfect 3-for-3 game.

Meanwhile a win for the Golden Eagles just wasn't in the stars two weeks ago as the team never even grasped a temporary lead. Their painful 34 to nothing loss to the UAB Blazers might stick with them for a while. Southern Miss was in a tough position by the half with the score already sitting at 31 to nothing.

The Blue Raiders are the favorite in this one with an expected 13.5-point margin of victory. Those who got lucky with them against the spread last Friday might want to hold off on placing bets this time since the squad has yet to string together back-to-back wins against the spread.

Middle Tenn. is now 3-4 while Southern Miss sits at 1-6. A couple defensive numbers to keep in mind before kickoff: Middle Tenn. is 218th worst in the nation in rushing touchdowns allowed with 13 on the season. Southern Miss has experienced some struggles of their own as they are stumbling into the game with the 214th most touchdowns allowed in the nation having given up 21 on the season.

The company Avangrid Renewables which operates 126 turbines in the windy Tehachapi Mountains about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles is working with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to breed the birds in captivity at the Oregon Zoo. The proposed program which was reported by The Los Angeles Times this week and is still subject to final approval by the Wildlife Service could begin as soon as this spring.

“Our goal is zero fatalities” Amy Parsons the operations wildlife compliance manager for Avangrid Renewables in Portland Ore. said in an interview on Tuesday. “But we’re a very proactive company and we want to take measures to minimize the risk to any species from our operations.”

Although the Wildlife Service’s Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office said in a statement that there had been no documented cases of a wind turbine injuring or killing a condor at the plant since it opened in 2012 it noted that condor presence near wind energy projects — and the potential for fatal collisions — would continue to increase with the growth of the wild condor population.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMzEvYXJlLXRoZXNlLXRyZWVzLWN1bHR1cmFsbHktbW9kaWZpZWQtb3ItanVzdC1iZW50LWRlcGVuZHMtb24td2hvLXlvdS1hc2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are these trees culturally modified… or just bent? Depends on whom you ask.,"BAILEY — Rooted on a former Ute encampment in the foothills of the Front Range the piney crown of a long-lived ponderosa pine pokes nearly 100 feet into the sky. Its trunk gnarled and knobbly with age is hollowed at the bottom offering what could be a narrow shelter for someone to hunt from. Higher up there’s a peephole — just wide enough for an arrow — carved in the cinnamon-colored bark.

The tree’s trunk begins to spiral near the top marking what some believe was a high energy source ideal for healing along what was a heavily traveled Native American trade route.

Before there were highway signs trees served as natural signposts through the forest marking important sites such as water sources sacred healing spots hunting lookouts and birthing stations Janet Shown co-founder of The Association for Native American Sacred Trees and Places said as she guided a group of curious people through the woods behind Glen Isle Resort in Bailey.

People are drawn to the unusually-shaped trees known to some as culturally-modified trees or marker trees and the tales some say they tell yet they are entangled in controversy. Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribal officials say no evidence of shaped trees is found in their oral traditions and some archaeologists point to nature to account for the trees’ twists and turns.

Marker trees dot the 160-acre property of Glen Isle a former railroad depot that first opened in the early 1900s. The 120-year-old Adirondack-style lodge now serves as a resort off U.S. 285 and as a cultural hub for Native American artifacts. A large collection of Native American dolls acquired by the resort’s former owner is displayed inside the two-story building along with artifacts such as beaded moccasins cradle boards made from deer hide and other artifacts dating back to 1000 A.D.

While touching the curling bark over a straight-edged scar on a ponderosa pine Shown said the girdling likely was done about 150 to 200 years ago before the last Utes were forced off Glen Isle’s surrounding land in the 1880s. Native Americans often used a tree’s soft inner bark — the nutrient-rich cambium layer — to make medicinal teas.

The “medicine trees” would give sustenance to women giving birth or to those on their menstrual cycle Shown said.

“If Native Americans did a bark peel they probably did this other very strange and unusual shape” she said pointing upward toward a thick arm of the tree that juts out horizontally and then straight up like a goalpost.

Some tribal members and members of The Association for Native American Sacred Trees and Places fear the historic trees will be chopped down as they say their significance remains largely unrecognized. The organization hopes to preserve the trees and the stories they tell by promoting responsible stewardship and working at a policy level Shown said. Shown worked at Glen Isle in the 1970s and returned to help the resort’s new owners identify important trees on their property using the knowledge passed along from James Jefferson a Southern Ute elder.

But a controversy stems from the twists and turns of the so-called culturally modified trees. Some archaeologists say the bizarre shapes are the consequence of natural phenomenon like heavy snowpack lightning or wind.

Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribal officials say their ancestors had no need to bend trees to provide direction. They knew their landscape well and used the mountains stars creeks and other landmarks to indicate their routes and hunting grounds according to an official statement tribal leaders sent to federal state and local governments in 2019.

According to Shown and fellow NASTaP cofounder Jefferson many of the trees identified as markers across the Front Range Royal Gorge and San Luis Valley — aboriginal territory and traditional hunting grounds for Ute bands — were intentionally changed by Native Americans to signal an important place in the forest.

Ponderosa pines grow from the top resulting in any modifications to permanently remain at the same height. Many were said to be grafted to become hunting perches or contain windows that visually framed a distant sacred landmark like Pikes Peak. “If I don’t see three or more signs of human modification I just figure it’s a maybe tree. Other ones we can tell ‘Oh that deformity is muscle tone or lightning. Lightning is usually jagged sometimes it could be straight but it’s in a different shape” Shown said. (Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun)

The Utes were masters at grafting often binding two pieces of a tree together with rope or hay to construct sturdy perches to hunt from or to build a window framing sacred places in the distance Shown said.

In Colorado Springs many trees frame Pike’s Peak also known as Tava or Sun Mountain the most sacred mountain to the Utes Shown said.

“It’s scary to think of how many have been cut” Shown said while standing behind Glen Isle Resort pointing across the road toward land owned by the state’s forest service. “They took a masticator and just decimated the forest. … We know this is a sacred site because of the number of (modified) trees around here and we wonder how many were lost. That happens all the time.”

Many of the modified trees on the Glen Isle property are ponderosa pines which are self-pruning conifers native to western North America. As the tree matures and more branches grow the sun can’t reach the bottom branches so they die and break off.

In the forest near Glen Isle the thick sturdy branches that exist high on a ponderosa pine are often a result of grafting Shown said.

The color of the bark is also a good tool to determine if a tree was modified by natives before they were forced off the land. Ponderosa bark appears gray during its younger stages of life and as it matures it turns more red forming broad pieces that break apart in large jigsaw puzzle-like pieces.

At about 200 years about a fourth of a tree’s bark flaunts a red hue and at 400 years almost all of its bark will be so Shown said.

(Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun)

Sometimes it’s tricky to determine if a tree was modified by animals or naturally she said.

“What we say in NASTaP is that there’s definite yeses there’s definite noes and there’s definite maybes … If I don’t see three or more signs of human modification I just figure it’s a maybe tree” Shown said. “But we know that if there’s one modified tree in an area there’s often more.”

And if there are several signs of human modification that’s also a good indication the tree served as a marker hundreds of years ago she said.

But tracing the roots of the bizarre trees is more complicated.

Roots of controversy

As NASTaP aims to preserve the culturally-modified trees that they believe serve as important historical markers other tribal members and archaeologists say there’s no such thing — the trees are just bent.

Last summer the Colorado Council of Professional Archaeologists issued a statement saying there’s no scientific evidence that humans altered the growth of the trees and that identifying them as such “diverts valuable resources that could otherwise be used to document and protect legitimate cultural resources and results in the dissemination of false and misleading information to the lay public.”

The CCPA cited the six-page statement sent by officials of the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain tribes that says the modification isn’t part of tradition.

“Some individuals claiming to possess Ute cultural knowledge have incorrectly asserted that Ute people purposefully bent trees for cultural purposes. According to tribal elders tribal historians spiritual leaders and traditional practitioners from the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribes agree this is not a known Ute practice within our oral tradition; nor is it practiced today” the 2019 statement reads.

The historic preservation officers for the tribes did not respond to phone calls and emails or said they were unable to comment.

Some individual families may have had their own tradition of bending trees but to ascribe those traditions to Ute general customs on behalf of all Ute people is inaccurate tribal leaders wrote in the statement. The only tree the Southern Ute tribe considers culturally modified which is not physically bent is known as a “peeled tree” in which bark is intentionally peeled from a ponderosa pine and occasionally from aspen the statement said.

Read the full statement issued by the Southern Ute

and Ute Mountain Ute tribes.

“There are certainly trees that we see evidence of cultural modification by native people from a long time ago in some cases a few hundred centuries” Greg Wolff president of the CCPA said.

That Native Americans harvested natural resources including tree bark for medicinal purposes and for food during times of food scarcity is well documented Wolff said.

But twisted trunks appearing as trail markers or pointing toward a sacred peak aren’t culturally modified he said.

“The CCPA statement is based on archaeological historical and ethnographic documentation and also forestry science archaeological science” Wolff said. “A lot of times what people ascribe to a cultural basis can often be explained by natural phenomenon. It is hard when folks categorically say a strange looking tree had to have been caused by human intervention.”

Wolff understands why so many people would be intrigued by the unusual trees.

“It’s natural to be interested in such a phenomenon. There’s an innate human curiosity about the natural world” he said. “We’re curious we want to know about things that are remarkable to us. But in many of these cases there are natural explanations for why these trees appear out of the ordinary.”

Still he urged caution.

“Folks will believe what they want to believe but again scientific evidence does not support a lot of those cases and neither does the statement provided by the official Ute preservation departments” he said.

Culturally-modified trees have been contested for years. Jefferson a Southern Ute elder and cofounder of NASTaP is among those who disagree with the official Ute statement contending that culturally-modified trees are an integral part of the Utes’ oral tradition.

“This is part of history” said Jefferson who lives on the Southern Ute reservation in Ignacio. “We are trying to prove that this is all written history. All of the things that western science is discovering the Indian people knew about and so they are only verifying what we knew what the old people knew 10000 years ago.”

Attendees walk a tour of culturally modified trees on Sunday Oct. 24 2021 near Glen Isle Resort in Bailey. Glen Isle built in the 1800s on a Ute encampment originally neighbored a heavily-traveled Native American trade route along current-day Highway 285. Trees were modified to signal cardinal directions store items mark ceremonial sites and other areas containing abundant hunting resources. (Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun)

Jefferson 88 said he hopes to preserve the tradition passed down from his elders. He disputes the statement from the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes and hopes it will be reversed.

“A lot of tribal people know about (the tradition) they just don’t want to be fighting with all of these archaeologists” Jefferson said. “These archaeologists are not Indian and never lived it. Never experienced like I have. We experienced all of this and we learned from our elders — and those are who told us.”



Sequoia Subia whose entire family is tribally enrolled and who recently became a member of NASTaP thinks it’s important to raise awareness around the trees to preserve the oral tradition that she has learned from her mother.

“This is the area my ancestors lived in” Subia said while walking along the Glen Isle Resort property. “Being a descendant of medicine men I know that this is stuff that my grandfathers once did decades ago.”"

The only reasons for this are

Confusion. Other passengers and crew might not realize it’s just water vapor

Annoyance. “Smoking” is deemed bad and other passengers may not like it in other words it’s banned for reasons similar to inflight cell phone calls on U.S. carriers (which are allowed on many airlines all over the world

Vaping is banned on airlines that is except on this past Wednesday’s Southwest Airlines Phoenix – Honolulu flight.

@SouthwestAir caught this on the flight to Honolulu last night. Flight crew did nothing when it was reported. Is it safe to assume you ""federal offense"" policy is crap? #SouthwestAirlines #vaping pic.twitter.com/0GedievJZb — Maddmmac (@maddmmac) October 29 2021

It actually seems to me that Southwest crew made the correct call not to confront the passenger and escalate the situation. They might have written him up filed a report with the airline and eventually the FAA – the passenger was breaking rules after all. But on an overwater flight without many places to divert it seems like a good idea not to be petty in immediate enforcement.

Put another way if there’s no immediate safety risk to the plane or to other passengers it has always seemed like a bad idea to escalate conflict inside of a metal tube out over the open ocean. To be clear I am not saying ‘don’t enforce the rules’. That would eventually lead to passengers learning that rules don’t need to be followed. Instead ask a passenger once to follow them. Then deal with the violation after the flight when the conduct in question entails little immediate risk.

The incident reportedly happened Friday on a Southwest flight from Houston to Albuquerque where AP journo Colleen Long claims that upon touch-down -- the pilot hopped on the speaker for the plane and said ""Let's go Brandon"" just as he was signing off.

TFW you’re trying to go on vacation and then the pilot says the very thing you’re working on over the loud speaker and you have to try to get him comment but then almost get removed from plane. https://t.co/xZI5FtLzJB — Colleen Long (@ctlong1) October 30 2021 @ctlong1

Long reports that some passengers were noticeably shocked and even gasped when they heard it. She apparently tried confronting the pilot himself for what he said ... but alleges she was almost tossed the aircraft for doing so.

A Southwest spokesperson told AP that their airline ""takes pride in providing a welcoming comfortable and respectful environment"" and that ""behavior from any individual that is divisive or offensive is not condoned."" It's unclear if any further action will be taken.

Folks online are furious over the alleged utterance ... demanding Southwest find the pilot and can him for hurling politically motivated rhetoric -- and what some are even calling a slur.

If you're unfamiliar with how this originated it all started a couple months ago when racecar driver Brandon Brown won a NASCAR event. During his post-race interview with NBC -- you could hear people in the crowd chanting ""F*** Joe Biden"" which the reporter tried brushing off as ""Let's go Brandon"" ... even though what they were saying was obvious and clear.

It happened Friday morning on a Southwest flight from Houston to Albuquerque according to an Associated Press journalist who said she was on the flight.

""Until and unless @SouthwestAir fires its #LetsGoBrandon pilot I will never fly on that airline"" wrote actor/filmmaker Andy Ostroy.

""The news coverage of the 'Let's Go Brandon' chant being repeated by a Southwest Airlines pilot brings to mind other Trumpian things that are permeating regular life"" author Sarah Posner wrote in a tweet.

""Vulgarity stand-in from ⁦@SouthwestAir cockpit"" wrote Washington Post editor Cathleen Decker who linked to reporting from the AP.

Will Bunch an opinion columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer mocked Southwest in a tweet:

YouTube personality Jim Heath claimed that Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly ""has officially made @SouthwestAir the Trumpy airline.""

""Its pilots now giving the 'f*ck you Biden' or 'let's go Brandon' GOP line during the flight"" Heath added. ""I've always loved flying Southwest. Don't plan on doing it ever again.""

In a statement to Fox News Southwest Airlines said it ""takes pride in providing a welcoming comfortable and respectful environment for the millions of Customers who fly with the airline each year and behavior from any individual that is divisive or offensive will not be tolerated.""

The phrase ""Let's go Brandon"" went viral after an interview earlier this month with race car driver Brandon Brown following his victory in a NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. In a post-race interview chants of ""F--- Joe Biden"" could be heard from the crowd. But the reporter interviewing Brown reported that the crowd was chanting ""Let's go Brandon."""

The Duchess of Sussex 40 provided $25 Starbucks gift cards for employees of the nonprofit PL+US which is working to win paid family and medical leave for all in the U.S. by 2022. The gift cards were supplied through her and Prince Harry's nonprofit the Archewell Foundation.

Neil Sroka communications director for PL+US posted a screenshot of his gift card to Twitter expressing his gratitude for the mother of two. ""The Duchess of Sussex (aka #MeghanMarkle) bought everyone at @PaidLeaveUS a few cups of coffee while we're working overtime to #SavePaidLeave. Unbelievably classy... and necessary. Truly honored to know she has our backs in the fight to win #PaidLeaveForAll"" he wrote.

Earlier this month Meghan recently advocated for paid leave in an open letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer published by Paid Leave for All.

""I'm not an elected official and I'm not a politician. I am like many an engaged citizen and a parent"" she wrote. ""And because you and your congressional colleagues have a role in shaping family outcomes for generations to come that's why I'm writing to you at this deeply important time—as a mom—to advocate for paid leave.

""Over the past 20 months the pandemic has exposed long-existing fault lines in our communities. At an alarming rate millions of women dropped out of the workforce staying home with their kids as schools and daycares were closed and looking after loved ones full-time. The working mom or parent is facing the conflict of being present or being paid. The sacrifice of either comes at a great cost"" she continued.

Meghan recalled growing up ""on the $4.99 salad bar at Sizzler"" as it was all her family could afford as well as when she entered the workforce herself and struggled to make ""enough to pay my rent and put gas in my car.""

She also acknowledged that she and Harry 37 have been fortunate enough to have time and resources to devote to son Archie Harrison 2 and 4-month-old daughter Lilibet Diana.

""Paid leave should be a national right rather than a patchwork option limited to those whose employers have policies in place or those who live in one of the few states where a leave program exists"" Meghan added. ""If we're going to create a new era of family first policies let's make sure that includes a strong paid leave program for every American that's guaranteed accessible and encouraged without stigma or penalty.""

“Unbelievably classy… and necessary” Sroka posted. “Truly honored to know she has our backs in the fight to win #PaidLeaveForAll.”

Markle who originally hails from Los Angeles previously issued a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

In the letter Markle claimed a national paid parental leave program would help women in particular stay in the workforce after millions quit their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic to look after children and other family full-time.

The Duchess insisted that “[p]aid leave should be a national right rather than a patchwork option limited to those whose employers have policies in place or those who live in one of the few states where a leave program exists.

Just six states — including New York and New Jersey — offer some form of paid family leave as does the District of Columbia. Three others — Connecticut Colorado and Oregon — have paid family leave laws that have yet to go into effect.

Thirty-nine of the country’s top 50 fast-food restaurants received the lowest ranking as “Dining Dawdlers” – including McDonald’s Subway and Chick-fil-A.

The “Moving the Menu” report was produced by World Animal Protection which advocates eating less meat as part of its mission to “change animals’ lives for the better.”

Sofritas at Chipotle. The Impossible Whopper at Burger King. Fresco style at Taco Bell.

Plant-based eaters once limited to wimpy salads minus cheese and often without dressings that contained dairy have increasingly more options at some of the most recognizable U.S. fast-food restaurants amid growing company commitments to diversify protein offerings and cut greenhouse gas emissions created by animal farming.

But for every Starbucks which introduced its Impossible Breakfast Sandwich in 2020 and Pizza Hut which is testing a plant-based pepperoni topping are “Dining Dawdlers” like McDonald’s Subway and Chick-fil-A according to a first-of-its-kind report to be released Monday on World Vegan Day by World Animal Protection.

Cameron Harsh programs director for the nonprofit animal welfare organization described the 24-page report as a guide to help “individual consumers align with the restaurants that share their values” but stressed that “a lot more progress” is needed to reduce the production and consumption of animal proteins for the sake of the climate and general health.

“What the ‘Menu Movers’ in this report have done is not just added plant-based alternatives to their menus and called it good they’ve actually talked publicly … about the benefits of these products” Harsh told USA TODAY.

In its “Moving the Menu” report shared first with USA TODAY World Animal Protection graded the country’s 50 largest fast-food chains on their efforts to vary protein offerings highlight the benefits of plant-based eating in their corporate social responsibility reporting and make public commitments to reduce the use of meat and increase vegan and vegetarian menu options.

Only seven chains were designated as “Menu Movers” the report card’s top ranking: Burger King Chipotle Starbucks KFC Panera Bread Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.

World Animal Protection while not a vegan or vegetarian organization advocates eating less meat as part of its mission to “change animals’ lives for the better” according to its website. One of the group’s primary initiatives is Meating Halfway a 21-day custom plan designed to give individuals and families accessible tools to reduce meat and increase plant-based foods in their diets.

An early trendsetter with sofritas a menu staple since 2014 Chipotle remains focused on pushing more vegetables and plant-based products to the “center of plate” said Stephanie Perdue the company’s vice president of marketing. The Mexican grill is now testing a meatless chorizo – free of gluten soy nuts and grains – at its Denver and Indianapolis locations.

The popularity of sofritas made from shredded tofu flavored with chipotle chiles poblano peppers and a blend of spices has only reinforced Chipotle’s thinking. The company expects to source 4.9 million pounds of organic tofu this year from Hodo Soy Beanery in California up from 4.2 million pounds in 2020.

“We knew that if it’s craveable you wouldn’t miss the meat” Perdue told USA TODAY. “You still get all those layers of flavors.”

Taco Bell which already offers more than 15 items on its “Veggie Cravings” menu is also testing additional plant-based options – including its Cravetarian meatless protein made from a seasoned blend of chickpeas and peas.

“With more than 7000 restaurants nationwide and consumers’ growing sustainability concerns we see the opportunity – and responsibility – to make a positive environmental impact” said Missy Schaaphok Taco Bell's director of global nutrition and sustainability adding that consumers shouldn’t have to “choose between crave-ability and responsible dining.”

Starbucks and Panera meanwhile have highlighted their respective commitments in recent sustainability reports noted by World Animal Protection.

In its 2020 Global Environmental and Social Impact Report Starbucks said “To meet our 2030 goals we set five key strategies rooted in science grounded in Starbucks Mission and Values and informed by comprehensive market research and trials: Expand plant-based menu options.”

While the COVID-19 pandemic delayed plans to test several plant-based dishes Panera said its “long-term aspiration is to have a menu where half of our entrees are plant-based” according to its most recent sustainability report.

Thirty-nine of the top 50 fast-food restaurants however aren’t taking meaningful steps to provide vegans and vegetarians with much more than the ketchup packets next to the napkin dispensers according to the World Animal Protection report.

While McDonald’s began testing its McPlant vegan burger at eight U.S. locations across four states this month the American fast-food icon has lagged behind Burger King long its primary rival. BK launched the Impossible Whopper at its 7000-plus locations more than two years ago and the company has reported U.S. guests who chose the meatless burger in 2020 “avoided the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving about 520 million miles in an average passenger vehicle.”

Subway with nearly 24000 locations – the most of any chain – has yet to provide a plant-based meat option nationally and failed to make a public commitment to expand its menu or reduce meat consumption.

Unlike KFC which has carried out plant-based chicken trials Chick-fil-A hasn’t featured a plant-based alternative on its menu publicly detailed any such plans or recognized the benefits of reducing animal proteins.

The shop co-founded by Manthri Srinath Amy McEwen Goller and her son Spencer Goller were all former employees of Espresso Royale. Ann Arbor Coffee Roasting Co. is the second to take over a former Espresso Royale location with former employees of the coffeeshop — M-36 Coffee Roasters opened in the former South University Ave. location in August.

McEwen Goller and her husband Marcus Goller were the original founders of Espresso Royale which opened on State St. in 1989.

“I think the most interesting thing about (the shop) is the fact that Manthri and Spencer and I are doing it together” McEwen Goller said. “It’s just really sweet to have a project with Manthri again and it’s incredibly nostalgic for me to have the store open again and to make it what we always wanted it to be just a clean beautiful friendly high quality place.”

According to Goller Ann Arbor Coffee Roasting Co. has another location in Brighton Mich. where they are currently roasting their coffee until the roaster for the Ann Arbor location is built. They expect the roaster to be completed by the first quarter of next year. They also make their chai at the Brighton location while all of the food and pastries are baked in-house at the Ann Arbor location.

Goller explained that the Loring Smart Roast roaster the cafe will use is very sustainable and will be showcased to customers once it is assembled.

“The roaster) uses a lot of the newer technology in coffee roasting and recycles hot air so it’s also very eco friendly. It uses less energy” Goller said. “So we’re planning on having the roaster be really a showpiece and something that’s upfront for everyone to get to see.”

Srinath described the coffee shop as “retro” in its sourcing and supply chain and said they cater to a wide array of dietary restrictions.

“That’s a fairly basic menu with focus on a lot of plant milk” Srinath said. “We do have really good baked goods a lot of vegan and gluten-free options. Other than that the actual core concept is pretty simple. We don’t do a lot of super sweet stuff but the things that we do when I say retro they kind of go back to a time in the coffee industry when the whole product line was much simpler.”

The building the shop is located in is considered a historic landmark by Ann Arbor’s Historic District Commission. The commission approved the roasting company’s renovation plans in July 2021 which according to McEwen Goller include some structural changes but “maintains the integrity of the historic building.”

“One of the other structural differences is some of the seating has been sacrificed to make way for the roaster” Goller said.

While the Ann Arbor Coffee Roasting Co. initially planned to open their cafe in September Goller said the October opening was caused by construction delays. Srinath said they are taking a flexible approach to opening during the pandemic.

“The business model is going to be flexible” Srinath said. “If we cannot use the space or decide we don’t want to we will have take out options or provide curbside service or anything along those lines that the current climate demands at any given time. It’s very as you go at this point it’s really pretty much impossible to prognosticate.”

Both McEwen Goller and Srinath said they had no difficulty hiring workers even with the ongoing labor shortage caused by the pandemic. Srinath emphasized that their wages were “competitive.” According to the coffee shop’s Instagram page it hired in new employees at $16 per hour.

LSA freshman Makena Crimaldi went to the shop soon after it opened and said she wished there was more seating available but that she really enjoyed her coffee and pastries.

“It was really good — I got a cappuccino today and then I got a blueberry muffin this morning and both are fantastic” Crimaldi said. “I love the location. I’m in West Quad (Residence Hall) so it’s a perfect place for me to come to study. For me back at home I love to find cute coffee shops. This is perfect for me to come work whenever.”

LSA freshman Daniella Ludmir also visited the shop and said she was very happy with her experience at the store.

“I love it here” Ludmir said. “I also love macadamia milk and it’s the only coffee shop that I’ve been to in Ann Arbor that has macadamia milk. It’s my second time here in three days and I discovered it three days ago.”

McEwen Goller emphasized how happy she was to be back in Ann Arbor. She said since moving to Ann Arbor in 1989 she had opened six stores in the city and several more across the country with her husband.

”We love it here … it’s absolutely wonderful to be back in the community again and to bring something really special” McEwen said. “Also both of my children have gone to U-M and my nephew’s gone to U-M. I’ve been picking kids up from the Hill for nine years now. It’s kind of fun to also revisit Ann Arbor as a mom of a college student.”

(WCAX) - It was championship Saturday at Thetford Academy for high school cross country in Vermont with a couple new faces and a few familiar ones taking home state titles.

In the Division I girls race CVU looked to run its streak of state championships to a lucky 13. Burlington had other plans as Rebecca Cunningham finished second along with another Seahorse placing in the Top 5 and two more in the Top 16.

The Seahorses ended the day five points ahead of CVU to bring home their first title since 2002 ending the RedHawks 12-year title run.

BFA’s Loghan Hughes continued to run away with her stellar season capturing the individual girls title in 19 minutes 51 seconds.

Harwood’s Ava Thurston claimed her fourth consecutive Division II state title. She finished with the best overall time in the state with 19 minutes 29 seconds. The Highlanders proved to be one of the best yet again with their third team title in the last four years.

Freshman Estella Laird led the way in Division III representing the North Branch School in Ripton as she pulled away for the title winning in 20 minutes 8 seconds.

Thetford took advantage of running on its home course with Madelyn Durkee finishing second. Three Panthers placed in the Top 10 to help Thetford Academy win its first state title since 1996.

It was a nail-biter in the boys Division I team race. Individually St. Johnsbury’s Evan Thornton-Sherman crushed the course in a state-best time in 16 minutes 33 seconds. He was one of two Hilltoppers to finish in the Top 5.

BFA put three in the Top 10 led by Jacob Tremblay’s third-place finish. Both BFA and St. Johnsbury tied after five runners but the Hilltoppers had the better sixth place finisher giving them the tiebreaker and their first state title since 1958.

Division II was all about dominance from U-32. The Raiders put five runners in the Top 6. Carson Beard guided the big blue train with a time of 16 minutes 43 seconds. U-32 earned its sixth straight state title with ease.

There was an even more dominant showing in Division III. The Craftsbury Chargers garnered seven out of the eight top spots. Cormac Leahy powered the Chargers with a winning time of 17 minutes 7 seconds to deliver back-to-back state titles for Craftsbury.

Funeral Services will be held with full Military Funeral Honors with Military Escort in Arlington National Cemetery in Washington DC in the morning of December 30 2021. LTC Stryker requested the Military Band play his favorite song “Stouthearted Men.” His favorite Bible verse was Psalms 23 and he loved the Serenity Prayer.

LTC Emil Joseph Stryker Jr. was born on November 7 1922 in South Boston Massachusetts to the late Emil Joseph and Annie Mae Bucknam Stryker. He retired from the US Army after over 30 years of active-duty service. LTC Stryker’s illustrious career spent in Patriotic service to his country included his arrival to the WWII European theater of operations via Utah Beach on August 14 1944 (LST-B-1248). He continued through France via Saint Mere Eglise LeMans Hartencourt Reims and on to Steinfort Luxembourg on October 9 1944 where he was during the WWII Battle of the Bulge (NUTS!) After that then Corporal/E4 Stryker attended Class 25 of Officer Candidate School in Fontainebleau France and graduated as an officer in June 1945. December 1947 then 1LT Stryker was assigned to the 23rd Infantry Regiment in Fort Lewis WA where he served with Companies A B C and D before being handpicked to set up the Alaskan defense system in 1948 as a “special Airborne/Ranger platoon.” In 1950 1LT Stryker went to Korea as the XO and rifle platoon leader and fought bravely and with distinction for gallantry in the Battles of Chipyong-ni and Kunu-ri. In 1954 he was assigned as the Company Commander of a Student Officer Company at Fort Benning GA. He became the Communications Instructor at the Infantry School in 1956 and gave briefings to many National and International leaders. His proficiency in French served him well from 1959 to 1962 when he served in Orleans France with the 3rd Logistical Command with responsibilities for all US military units in Europe and Africa. After Command & General Staff College in 1963 he was assigned to the Pentagon as Chief Training Branch Operations Division Tactical Communications Directorate where he was involved in communications for the entire U. S. Army. In July 1965 he was the Signal Advisor for the Infantry Artillery and Armor groups and he went to Vietnam to “visit” their major headquarters as well as units like the Special Forces A-Teams. Following a State Department French course to make his French proficiency official he was assigned as the Deputy Chief Military Mission to Liberia West Africa. He retired in July 1974 as the Chief of Staff 2nd ROTC Region in Fort Knox KY. Retirement from active duty was followed by what he termed his highest honor of being appointed as the 1st Battalion 23rd Infantry Regiments’ Acting Honorary Colonel on June 8 2000. LTC Stryker LOVED these brave soldiers; his comrades in arms!

LTC Emil J. Stryker Jr.’s military awards include the Combat Infantryman Badge Silver Star (Korea) the Legion of Merit Army Commendation Medal Good Conduct Medal Presidential Unit Emblem Meritorious Unit Emblem American Campaign Medal European-Africa-Middle East Campaign Medal World War Victory Medal Army Of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp National Defense Service Medal Korean Service Medal Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation Badge United Nations Service Medal Marksmanship Badge with Carbine and Pistol Bars and World War II Honorable Service Lapel Button and the Military Order of Saint Maurice-Primicerius.

According to the latest reports the US Army has moved a step closer towards the deployment of directed energy weapons (DEWs) for countering its adversaries.

Earlier this week General Dynamics reportedly paired up with Epirus Inc. for delivering a directed energy weapon that uses high-power microwave technology. The weapon developed under this collaboration will be fitted on the Stryker combat vehicles manufactured by General Dynamics for the US Army.

In July this year the RCCTO held combat drills for a variety of futuristic scenarios which involved a number of aerial threats using a laser weapon system. Even though the details of the weapon were not revealed at that time the recent development in the high-energy laser weapon system indicates the participants in the standoff.

The New Laser Weapon

The US Army Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) awarded a contract to General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems (GA-EMS) and Boeing for producing a prototype of a 300 kilowatt-class solid-state distributed gain high energy laser weapon system. Work under this contract will be completed in San Diego and Albuquerque according to a company press release.

“The partnership combines both companies’ expertise in Directed Energy to deliver best-in-class combat-ready protection for the warfighter with unmatched speed performance safety and affordability.

Specifically the system will leverage GA-EMS’ scalable Distributed Gain Laser technology with Boeing’s beam director and precision acquisition tracking and pointing software to provide a complete demonstrator with sophisticated laser and beam control” the press release said.

“The high power compact laser weapon subsystem prototype that GA-EMS will deliver under this contract will produce a lethal output greater than anything fielded to date” Scott Forney president of GA-EMS said in the press release. The weapon system delivered under this contract will be deployed not only against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but also against missiles.

The design of the prototype demonstrated in the contract will incorporate two seventh-generation lasers which will be developed by General Atomics. “Recent architectural improvements have enabled our single-beam DG Lasers to achieve comparable beam quality to fiber lasers in a very simple design without the need for beam combination” said Dr. Michael Perry vice president for lasers and advanced sensors at GA-EMS.

“This technology represents a leap-ahead capability for air and missile defense that is necessary to support the Army’s modernization efforts and defeat next-generation threats in a multi-domain battlespace” Forney added.

The “distributed gain laser” is a liquid-based laser and is thus different from the 50–150-kilowatt fiber-based lasers which the military has adopted till now. The distributed gain lasers provide a smaller size weight and power considerations which enable the system to be scaled up for more powerful laser beams.

The US Navy had deployed the first high-energy laser weapon called LaWS (Laser Weapon System) on the USS Ponce in the year 2014. This laser weapon system reportedly had an output of 30 kilowatt. Military lasers usually tend to be in the 30-kilowatt to 100-kilowatt range. This is mainly used for shooting down small drones.

The new 300-kilowatt laser system is part of a US Army project for developing defensive lasers which are capable of shooting down incoming threats.

Last year the Army demonstrated a 10-kilowatt laser weapon as it defeated small mortar rounds. Justin Bronk a research fellow at UK security think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said that powerful lasers can strike bigger targets and can also engage multiple targets quickly.

“It will allow the system to engage a greater density of incoming threats and also potentially engage threats which offer a shorter engagement window either due to speed or very low altitude flight trajectory” he said.",,,,,,,,,

What exactly is Synchrony II? According to a friend this is the gist:

Synchrony II was first called Ebony II back in 1973 and was originally an all-Black women’s dance group made up of people from Carleton St. Olaf and the Northfield area. They eventually opened it up to students of all races genders and experience levels and rebranded the group as Synchrony II.

Interesting right? Whether you’re an experienced dancer or have no experience at all you are welcome to join Synchrony.

Taste Of Carleton

The first time I went to see a Synchrony show was when I visited Carleton back in fall 2018 through Taste of Carleton. I remember sitting there not sure what to expect but feeling the energy in the air. The crowd roared as the first group of performers got into position. I don’t remember the songs that were played or the choreography that was performed but I remember having a blast seeing the performers just having fun. Even though not everyone was synchronous (see what I did there?) I was awed by the performance.

Fall 2021

Once I heard that Synchrony was going to perform I asked my best friend Gabby if she had ever seen a performance. “No” she said! Aghast I insisted that she absolutely HAD to see a Synchrony show before graduation. (It’s not a ritual but I think it’s great to see what other students have been working on as the term gets progressively harder.) Due to COVID-19 Synchrony was not able to perform last year so this show was their first performance in two years.

Of course Sayles was packed! Students were sitting in Lower Sayles standing on the sides or even looking down from Upper Sayles. Pro tip: If you want to get a good view of a show get there early and claim a spot on Upper Sayles or in the first two rows of chairs.

A Sneak Peek

Below is a sequence of photos I was able to take of a performance:

How to Participate

In typical Carleton fashion there’s a Google group for Synchrony! At the beginning of each term an email is sent out about a welcome meeting. Anyone can come to the meeting and join a dance or direct one. If you want to choreograph a dance you should probably be ready ahead of time because a demonstration of your dance would be expected. Since the show is during sixth week everyone needs to be able to learn the moves and positions in time. There are usually two hour-long practices each week held late at night (because that’s the only time everyone is free).

Final Thoughts

Even though I am personally not in Synchrony (because I am already in WHOA! and Karl-Pop) I am always excited to see my fellow Carleton students’ hard work in their performance. (Also I knew a lot more people in Synchrony than I thought!)

And best of all? Once the performance is done all of the performers invite audience members to freestyle dance with them.

Trading is a lucrative venture and seasoned traders know very well that deep pockets aren’t enough to be successful in this wealth-generating scheme. Traders are required to be fully equipped with the right knowledge and strategies. This is because there are many complex variables involved in trading which is why one platform aims to be a hub of reliable trading information.

Above all the platform desires to help traders analyze overwhelming trading information through the help of A. I and lead them to profitable trading decisions.

Background

The Synchrony Labs team comprises engineers and software architects headed by Andrew Fraser the company’s co-founder and current chief architect/engineer as well as Andy Keh the Chief Analytics Engineer who also happens to be the co-founder.

Synchrony Founders Andrew Fraser (left) and Andy Keh (right)

With the team members’ in-depth experience in software development traditional finance entrepreneurship and blockchain they aim to position Synchrony as one of the most innovative platforms in the blockchain industry.

What is Synchrony?

Synchrony is a Solana-based on-chain copy trading and indexing platform that allows users to execute in-depth analysis from other traders’ wallets to formulate better trading strategies.

Copy Trading

On-Chain Copy Trading is an automated form of copy-trading that copies other on-chain transactions that happened on the blockchain. Aside from allowing users to input wallet addresses and copy their entire valid transactions in their copy trade wallet it can also define restrictions on the users’ wallets instead of allowing protocols to define those restrictions.

Synchrony’s copy trading capabilities take full advantage of Solana’s industry-recognized high throughput and transaction speed.

Platform users can input any wallet or choose a leader-wallet from the Synchrony leaderboard and the protocol’s secured and efficient system will do the rest.

Users’ wallet behavior can run based on user-configured parameters ensuring that the executed copy-trade aligns with the user’s risk profile and appetite.

Auto copy trading allows users to have a straightforward copy of the transactions made by a leader wallet. While this may sound convenient users must know that it has major risks which include intentionally sabotaging a copier by executing trades meant to fail in the first place.

With this big and costly risk a copier must first ensure a leader wallet’s reliability and trustworthiness to ensure that the danger of sabotage can never happen.

Indices

Synchrony can examine any on-chain instruments from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) liquidity pools tokens including yield farms.

The platform’s indices can perform complex strategies with little to no friction. This capability is made possible by algorithmically optimized and programmatically managed single-click solutions.

Index-driven copy trading allows whitelisting of instruments candidate tokens and protocols and uses indices to decide if a valid transaction made by a leader wallet can be considered a copy-trade.

Users can also use an index a combination of indices within Synchrony and even build their own if they think that it can provide better results.

On-Chain Data Analytics

Synchrony’s advanced on-chain analytics can execute macro-level insights on users’ on-chain behavior and ecosystem sentiment. Its analytics can also provide users with a clear overall picture of on-chain-related details that users can understand.

On top of these things Synchrony’s analytical engine runs an innovative combination of off-chain and on-chain data.

Managing trades and wallets including studying analytics and doing thorough research are indeed overwhelming tasks. But thanks to Synchrony’s advanced tools platform users can seamlessly research and transact with the whole Solana ecosystem straight from one application.

Its analytics and aggregation services offer users comprehensive insights into the on-chain activity of wallets protocols tokens and products which allows them to adjust their insights from granular to broad level.

Wallet Trust Factor

Wallet Trust Factor (WTF) collects various data points available on-chain and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers. It converts them into an organized ranking system that provides users a bird’s eye view of a wallet’s trustworthiness.

At first glance the process appears to be oversimplified but the truth is complex fast and efficient processes of testing and retesting of hypotheses are involved in the background to produce comprehensive data of a wallet’s reliability.

Wallet Analytics

Synchrony can lay out information related but not limited to performance and history in a very organized manner to enable users to cross-compare other tokens indexes and wallets. And all users need to do to access this rich yet easy-to-digest information is by simply entering a wallet address.

And to help users better infuse their trading or investing strategies with comprehensive information the platform’s wallet analytics serves as a rich source of up-to-date and reliable data that users can trust.

Another goal of Synchrony is to rollout an analytics service on an ecosystem-wide level which can execute macro-level insight into participants’ rich data which includes sentiments and behaviors.

Aggregation

The platform provides users with all the necessary data of Solana’s protocols which allows them to backtest strategies manage their portfolios and compare assets in one place.

The level of analysis depends on the end-user; whether he prefers a broad inspection or diving into details the platform can efficiently deliver all these outputs.

Synchrony aims for continuous user adoption by making users’ ecosystem experience as simple as possible while delivering the comprehensive results that they need.

Customization

The comprehensiveness of data is almost if not completely useless if it doesn’t meet a user’s unique needs. That’s why the element of relevance and customization is needed to provide users with satisfying results.

Synchrony’s platform can give detailed outputs and meet users’ unique interests and needs which are relevant aspects to generate truly helpful data. Its goal is to provide users with a single reliable source for all of their decentralized finance (DeFi) needs in Solana and Synchrony is well equipped to achieve this goal through its advanced aggregation and analytics services.

Synchrony is well aware that lowering its ecosystem’s barriers to allow more people to benefit from its services is crucial to success but this is not enough. It also recognizes the importance of providing users with comprehensive tools to help them sort and analyze the rich information they can access inside the ecosystem.

Conclusion

Accuracy comprehensiveness flexibility and reliability are Synchrony’s biggest and most important capabilities. The ideal combination of these assets would help traders in their venture and lead them to more informed and profitable decisions.",,,,,,,,,

Employees supporting the Fort McCoy Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) Food Program Management Office and LRC Supply Subsistence Management Office continue with a busy mission supporting food-service operations at Fort McCoy Wis.



The installation’s food-service team ensures its mission is completed according to established standards every day LRC officials said.



That team includes the Food Program Management Office and the Subsistence Supply Management Office (SSMO); the full food-service contractors; and food suppliers such as Sysco Foods of Baraboo Wis. This team supports a variety of training operations on post and non-training operations such as Operation Allies Welcome.



The SSMO for example is one of the busiest organizations during any large training event. The SSMO has a small staff and that staff orders receives and distributes all food and rations necessary for each exercise as well as for units conducting weekend extended combat or annual training and the other operations officials noted.



Fort McCoy's motto is to be the “Total Force Training Center.”



Also located in the heart of the upper Midwest Fort McCoy is the only U.S. Army installation in Wisconsin. The installation has provided support and facilities for the field and classroom training of more than 100000 military personnel from all services nearly every year since 1984.

One that's persisted online is that 5G networks caused the disease. A new one involves vaccines somehow being linked to 5G tracking. Both are completely wrong. Radio waves can't create a virus which is what causes COVID-19. And if someone wanted to track you your phone is a more likely culprit than radio transmitters that are entirely too large to fit into a syringe.

But that hasn't stopped threats against broadband engineers and possible arson attacks against UK phone towers prompting UK carriers to ask people to stop burning the towers and the UK's national medical director to call out the 5G conspiracy theory as ""complete and utter rubbish."" The US Department of Homeland Security issued a warning last year about the potential threat to wireless equipment. Communications networks are crucial in the fight against the pandemic.

The COVID-19 conspiracy theory has spread on social media. Keri Hilson an American singer with 4.2 million followers on Twitter sent several tweets in April 2020 that attempted to link the coronavirus to 5G. She wrote: ""People have been trying to warn us about 5G for YEARS. Petitions organizations studies...what we're going thru is the affects [sic] of radiation. 5G launched in CHINA. Nov 1 2019. People dropped dead.""

That same month actor Woody Harrelson became the latest celebrity to falsely connect 5G to the coronavirus. He shared an article in an Instagram post saying that while he hasn't ""fully vetted"" rumors linking 5G to the pandemic sweeping the globe ""I find it very interesting.""

Others on YouTube and Facebook including an anti-5G Facebook group have also shared false claims. But YouTube that month said it would remove 5G-coronavirus hoax videos implementing a ban one day after stopping just short of that. Twitter has started labeling tweets containing the hoax and adding links to legitimate sources of information (but it's had some trouble).

""We're committed to providing timely and helpful information at this critical time including raising authoritative content reducing the spread of harmful misinformation and showing information panels using NHS and WHO data to help combat misinformation"" YouTube said in a statement. ""Now any content that disputes the existence or transmission of COVID-19 as described by the WHO and local health authorities is in violation of YouTube policies. This includes conspiracy theories which claim that the symptoms are caused by 5G.""

Watch this: Pandemic: Here's what's changed about the coronavirus 05:54

Facebook also said it's removing posts inaccurately connecting 5G to the coronavirus.

""We are taking aggressive steps to stop misinformation and harmful content from spreading on our platforms and connect people to accurate information about coronavirus"" the company said in a statement. ""Under our existing policies against harmful misinformation we are starting to remove false claims which link COVID-19 to 5G technology and could lead to physical harm.""

In March 2020 a Facebook user named Ben Mackie falsely linked 5G to the coronavirus saying in part that it's not actually a virus. ""They are trying to get u scared of a fake ass virus when it the 5G towers being built around the world"" he said. He also claimed that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates invented the technology and that it's an effort to depopulate the world. And Mackie said that vaccines being developed for the coronavirus are actually chips that will be implanted in people.

(Editors' note: We are not linking to these posts because they contain falsehoods.)

Those claims were debunked by UK fact-checker FullFact and other experts have chimed in.

""This story about 5G has no credence scientifically and is certainly a potential distraction as is other such misinformation from controlling the COVID-19 epidemic"" said Dr. Jonathan M. Samet dean of the Colorado School of Public Health.

Brendan Carr who serves on the Federal Communications Commission tweeted that Hilson's effort to link 5G to the coronavirus ""is straight from the most dangerous depths of tin foil hat land."" He noted that COVID-19 is caused by a virus that's spread by person-to-person contact not by radio waves and he reiterated that the FCC Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency all say 5G is safe.

5G is the new super-fast wireless technology that's been rolling out across the globe. In the US 5G networks are available nationwide. 5G is also live in a number of other countries such as China South Korea Germany and the UK. The technology is poised to change the way we live and is expected to power everything from self-driving cars to advanced augmented reality experiences. The belief is that whatever country leads in 5G will lead the world over the coming decades and possibly longer.

5G health concerns?

But ever since companies first started talking about 5G there have been concerns expressed by some people about the technology's impact on health. One version of 5G called millimeter wave runs on very high-frequency radio waves. Those signals can't travel long distances which requires towers to be placed close together and installed in more locations. That has reignited worries that the radio waves could produce harmful radiation that could cause brain cancer reduced fertility headaches and other illnesses.

The FDA and FCC say there's nothing to worry about because studies haven't found a link between radio frequency signals from cellphones or cell towers and disease. But because 5G is so new there's no definitive way to know if it will cause long-term health problems.

What can be definitively stated is that 5G doesn't cause or spread a virus.

""It's a ridiculous concept"" said John Bucher a senior scientist with the National Toxicology Program a US Health and Human Services interagency program dedicated to testing and evaluating substances in our environment. ""Each year you get a new strain of flu that goes around. That's what viruses do -- mutate and move around that way probably as long as there's been life.""

A coronavirus is a type of virus that's spread from person-to-person contact. It doesn't travel through something like radio waves. You can't get it from using your phone or watching TV -- unless the phone itself or the remote control is contaminated with coronavirus. This novel coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family. They look like spiked rings when viewed under an electron microscope and are named for these spikes which form a halo or ""crown"" (corona is Latin for ""crown"") around their viral envelope.

The coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The virus initially known as 2019-nCoV was reported to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31 and has been under investigation since. Other coronaviruses include SARS and MERS. In mid-March the World Health Organization labeled the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and the virus' spread has caused countries around the world including the US to take drastic measures like lockdowns.

One point addressed by the 5G-coronavirus theories is that COVID-19 came from China because that's where most 5G network towers are. While China does have service in many areas 5G came to South Korea and parts of the US first. The US hasn't seen major numbers of coronavirus until the past couple of weeks. COVID-19 also has spread to areas without 5G like Iran and Japan.

""There appears to be no dispute that animals are the source of the coronavirus according to experts like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control"" said CTIA the wireless industry trade association said.

This isn't the first time that 5G has been a target of conspiracy theories. Russia which has sown misinformation and influenced the 2016 US presidential election has included 5G as one of its target areas. Broadcaster RT America which is funded by the Russian government a year ago published a report called ""5G Wireless: A Dangerous 'Experiment on Humanity'"" that sought to create fear about the technology. The New York Times at the time said it was an effort by Russia to slow the US push for 5G.

Video games are a nearly $180 billion industry. And if you've ever played one before you might not realize the debt you owe to a man named Jerry Lawson. Gerald ""Jerry"" Lawson who died in 2011 at the age of 70 isn't a household name — but he was a gaming pioneer and one of the few Black engineers working in the tech industry in the 1970s. In 1976 Lawson led a team of engineers that developed and released the first removable video game cartridges. At the time gaming consoles came pre-loaded with a set number of games like Atari's ""Pong."" The console Lawson's team built for the cartridges called the Fairchild Channel F and released by a San Francisco-based semiconductor company mostly flopped — but the game-changing idea was later adopted by popular gaming brands like Atari and Nintendo. And while the average gamer might not know Lawson's name he's earned recognition from the video game industry in recent years including a spot in the World Video Game Hall of Fame. And Google even made Lawson the subject of a Doodle animation to recognize what would have been his 82nd birthday December 1 2022. ""He's absolutely a pioneer"" Allan Alcorn the creator of ""Pong"" said about his friend in 2011 when the International Game Developers Association honored Lawson's career.

The origins of a Silicon Valley pioneer

Lawson was raised in Queens New York City and never graduated from college. As one of the few Black engineers in Silicon Valley in the 1970s Lawson told Vintage Computing & Gaming in 2009 his skin color ""could be both a plus and minus."" Being an anomaly in tech helped him stand out — in both productive and uncomfortable ways. ""If you did good you did twice as good [because] you got instant notoriety about it"" Lawson said. Lawson ran in similar circles as some of Silicon Valley's more well-known giants. Once he said he met Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at the Homebrew Computer Club a local hobbyist group — and ""was not impressed with them — either one in fact."" But Alcorn impressed him. After Fairchild sent Lawson to meet with Alcorn to discuss electronic parts for ""Pong"" a switch flipped in Lawson's brain: He began a side project building his own coin-operated video game in his garage. And when Fairchild found out about the game called ""Demolition Derby"" the company convinced him to build a much fancier gaming console at work.

Building the Channel F for 'fun'

Lawson's console would be a first: Fairchild had never built one before. Lawson said he felt ""like a secret agent"" quietly developing his platform without tipping off any competitors he said in a 2005 keynote address at the Classic Gaming Expo in Burlingame California. After just six months of development Lawson's team emerged in 1976 with the Channel F which stood for ""fun."" The Channel F included the gaming world's first digital at-home joystick and even featured the first-ever ""pause"" button for a gaming console. But mostly it stood out because players could swap out different video game cartridges. Lawson's team had to build a special mechanism that allowed you to insert and remove cartridges over and over again ""without destroying the semiconductors"" or even causing a small explosion from static electricity. ""Nobody had the capability of plugging in memory devices in mass quantity like [that] in a consumer product"" Lawson said in 2009. ""Nobody.""

A lasting legacy — especially for Black engineers",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbmljaGVnYW1lci5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLXRoZS1sZWdhY3ktb2YtdGhlLXJlc2ktbGlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feature: The Legacy of the “Resi-Like”,"While there are the most well known Resident Evil like games there are still others out there that are still deserving of attention.

In the 1990s the original Alone in the Dark revolutionized adventure game design by incorporating horror cinema elements; such as camera placement and editing simulated by characters moving between shots.

While it was cumbersome to play due to the menu system still abiding by the point-and-click adventure game roots still holding it back it would be 1996’s Resident Evil that would refine the foundation set by Alone in the Dark.

Both games relied on a very innovative movement system that would allow players to stay in control no matter what the constantly changing camera angle would cut to. Holding the up button always meant the player-character would move in the direction they were facing. This became known as “tank-controls” or as some gamers have come to call; “Resi-like”.

It took a little getting used to and even when gamers mastered it the added friction helped the tense horror atmosphere. Every step taken became a deliberate and careful motion that demanded consideration. These were games where running around carelessly would lead to punishment. Naturally hardcore game design like this would not be embraced by normies or casual gamers.

As the 2000s raged on this style of survival-horror died out. Resident Evil would eventually abandon the design philosophy it popularized and would become more known for being a traditional third-person shooter. Silent Hill would follow and some indie developers who would be inspired by the classics would not fully commit to fixed camera angles and tank-controls.

The recent release of Tormented Souls proved that this kind of gameplay is still valid and not outdated. It’s an incredible horror experience made by passionate developers who understood why the old Resi-likes are so enduring and beloved. While there are the most well known Resident Evil like games there are still others out there that are still deserving of attention.

Fatal Frame / Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly / Fatal Frame III: The Tormented

Developer: Tecmo

Publisher: Tecmo

Platforms: PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 (via PSN) Xbox (as Fatal Frame: Special Edition and Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Director’s Cut)

Release Date: December 13th 2001 (Fatal Frame) November 27th 2002 (Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly) November 8th 2005 (Fatal Frame III: The Tormented)

Players: 1

Price: $9.99 USD each (via PlayStation 3 PSN)

The Fatal Frame trilogy on PlayStation 2 is one of the rare instances of a perfect trilogy on a single console. This generation was a time where horror games could look incredible and cater to a hardcore player while not demanding a AAA production. Every entry only got more refined as Tecmo honed their craft with the PlayStation 2 architecture.

All three games use the standard Resi-like tank-control layout; but what made these games stand out from the much more popular Resident Evil or Silent Hill was that Fatal Frame‘s combat is functionally a first-person shooter.

The Camera Obscura exorcises spirits by taking snapshots of them. Getting really close and taking a shot at the last second before an attack does big damage encouraging risk versus reward gameplay. The second and third game go so far as to adopt the standard twin-stick modern controls that almost every first person shooter uses to this day.

These games found a perfect middle ground that solves a lot of issues that a lot of contrarians have with Resi-like gameplay and that has to do with combat. Miu is perfectly capable of circle-strafing around enemies- something no S.T.A.R.S. members would do till Resident Evil 6.

The original Fatal Frame is an impressive start to the series. Miku sets out to find her missing brother who recently explored the Himuro mansion. Angry spirits have overrun the place due to a portal to hell being opened. The harrowing adventure is heavy with atmosphere and genuinely makes it hard to continue due to the oppressive ambiance.

Tank controls are tight between all three games and the picturesque camera angles are always expertly framed to make the scenes more uncomfortable. Players will be forced to do things that will make their blood run cold and there are constant sightings of fleeting glimpses of spirits.

It may be a small game but it’s packed with replay value due to the various endings to earn. The variety of film stocks that have different statistics function as different ammo types and also adds variety to combat. A year later an even better sequel would release and would compound on the best aspects of the formula.

Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly is a huge sequel where Tecmo spared no expense. The first game was a claustrophobic experience that was mostly set indoors but Fatal Frame II has Mio and Mayu exploring several haunted houses set in a sprawling village to get lost in. Environments cheekily become interconnected like a massive “Metroidvania” style map.

Not only does Mio have to contend with roaming groups of vengeful spirits but she also has to keep her sister alive and well. Puzzles also further refined in their design and combat is much smoother than before. This is also the entry where the standard first-person shooter controls as we know them today were implemented into the photography mechanics making this game very accessible to modern players.

Most fans of the series would agree that Crimson Butterfly would be the peak of the franchise. It would eventually get a remake on the Wii in PAL territories and Japan but it dropped the framable frames of the fixed camera for the typical over-the-shoulder perspective that has become common with almost all non-first person games today.

By the time Fatal Frame III: The Tormented came around Resi-like fatigue had begun to set in. There were fewer survival games releasing overall and Resident Evil 4 was about to come out and completely shifted the paradigm of the genre. The faithful enjoyers of Resi-likes would find that The Tormented would be one of the best looking PlayStation 2 games looking almost a generation ahead.

The last of the PlayStation 2 Fatal Frame games boasted incredible visuals and effects that gave it an atmosphere on par with the legendary Silent Hill 2 and 3. Gameplay is largely consistent with the prior entries and focuses on a new character who has connections to Miku from the first game and exploring the enigmatic “Manor of Sleep.”

This trilogy would get future installments on Wii and Wii U but would abandon the Resi-like gameplay. This initial batch of games on PlayStation 2 are some of the best examples of the Resi-like survival-horror genre that is as good and in some cases better than the more mainstream titles. There is no going wrong with any or all of them and all three are very affordable on PSN for PlayStation 3.

Shinji Mikami perfected the Resi-like survival-horror with Resident Evil and with Dino Crisis he would further expand on what can be done with the game design philosophy. Zombies were out and dinosaur-mania had swept the globe thanks to the film Jurassic Park. Mikami’s next game would take advantage of this phenomena and make raptors and a T.Rex the main predator in his next survival-horror opus.

Not all PlayStation Resi-likes had pre-rendered backgrounds; some had fully modeled 3D environments. Silent Hill was the most famous example with how it used a keen director’s eye to set up unbelievable shots as the player would move through the scene. Dino Crisis was the one of the other examples of a camera being used in this manner by a director.

While it may not be held in as high regard as the psychological-horror masterpiece; Dino Crisis would prove to be one of the most tense and harrowing Resi-likes on the PlayStation.

The primal fear of being hunted is universal. The sensation of being stalked by an enormous hungry lizard tracking the scent of your blood while trying to run away with tank-controls and masterfully composed shots is true tour de force.

The first Dino Crisis is a lot like Mikami’s prior Resident Evil games but with an even greater emphasis on puzzles and survival. Many of the puzzles are tied to the scenario itself.

There are many instances of players having to make hard choices of risking confrontations with raptors for a new route or an item. Dino Crisis is a fairly open ended horror game that has no hand holding and many options for the player to experiment and explore.

Different ammo types and healing items are craftable and there are even different healing items that have unique properties too. Dino Crisis offers a lot of tools and possibilities to the player and it’s up to them on how to use them to confront the danger. There are a few curve balls the designers will use to scare the player like sudden instant death QTEs that are scripted under obscure requisites so there is no relaxing.

For some reason Dino Crisis didn’t get as big as Resident Evil despite it being a better game in many regards. Its design philosophy can be seen in future puzzle-heavy Resident Evil entries such as Code Veronica and the remake on Gamecube.

For the best way to experience this Resi-like classic; the enhanced Dreamcast port is the best but the original PlayStation version is viable affordable and playable on the common PlayStation 3.

Capcom probably didn’t want to keep two concurrent survival-horror franchises going at the same time cannibalizing each other. When it came time to make a sequel to Dino Crisis it would have a totally different approach and prioritize hardcore action over puzzles and methodical gameplay. Despite this new direction; Dino Crisis 2 would still be a Resi-like.

Going into the sequel it’s apparent that it’s a totally different experience. Dino Crisis 2 is almost like an arcade action game with how much running and gunning there is. One would think this wouldn’t work as a Resi-like but it does and as a result is one of the more refined and polished action games on the PlayStation.

The gameplay is fluid and responsive; the playable characters move at full sprint instead of walk and auto aiming compounded with multiple targets and 180 degree turning makes the shooting feel tactical and easy to pick up. It’s too bad that the Dino Crisis franchise had died off. This could have been Capcom’s action alternative to Resident Evil instead of Resident Evil trying to be everything to everyone.

Parasite Eve II

Developer: Squaresoft

Publisher: Square EA

Platforms: PlayStation PlayStation 2 (via backwards compatibility) PlayStation 3 (via PSN) PlayStation Portable PlayStation Vita

Release Date: January 12 2000

Players: 1

Price: $5.99 USD (via PlayStation 3 PSN)

The original Parasite Eve is a survival-horror action-RPG enduring classic that is still unlike anything Squaresoft would ever make ever again. It’s a highly enjoyable game that is very accessible to modern players and its success would spawn a sequel.

Parasite Eve II is not like its predecessor and instead of expanding upon the mechanics established in the first game it would push the scope of what is possible with pre-rendered Resi-likes. It’s jarring going from the first Parasite Eve to its sequel.

Resident Evil 2 was a huge hit in 1998 and is one of the highest selling PlayStation games of all time. Squaresoft saw an opportunity to make their established horror franchise take on some of the properties that made Resident Evil 2 a success. The random RPG-like encounters and tactical combat were dropped in favor for good old-fashioned tank controls and pivot and shoot action.

To call Parasite Eve 2 a rip-off of Resident Evil 2 would be dishonest and reductive. The truth is that Parasite Eve 2 would be a much more ambitious horror game than anything else before it. Branching story paths multiple endings and Squaresoft’s panache for lavish production values make this Resi-like one of the most impressive and longest examples of its genre.

If there was one thing Parasite Eve II failed to copy from Resident Evil 2 it would be its fluid and tight controls. Getting tank-controls right is a very delicate art and while they are not the worst Parasite Eve II‘s inputs feel stiff and sluggish. Aya’s movement just does not feel as natural or refined as playing as any of the S.T.A.R.S. members or even as Harry Mason.

Aya’s rigidness is made up for her vast cache of magical abilities weaponry and equipment; something that should be no surprise given Squaresoft’s experience with crafting expansive RPGs. Players will have options on what weapon or magical abilities they want to specialize in; making Parasite Eve II highly fertile for experimentation when playing through the other story branches.

The amount of post-game unlock able content is outrageous and extremely compelling. Some items are call-backs to Final Fantasy games and the extra arcade-like modes add a substantial value to the experience. Of all the Resi-likes on the original PlayStation Parasite Eve II ranks as the most dense with its content and features.

One of the major x-factors of Parasite Eve II is its visuals and the impressive effects Squaresoft achieved with pre-rendered backgrounds. Seeing backgrounds animate was nothing new in 2000 but Squaresoft was so bold to have moments where the camera would move within the pre-render creating an unbelievable cinematic effect.

There were some moments like this that were experimented with in Final Fantasy VIII and IX. But in Parasite Eve II the artists and animators pull it off with so much more confidence.

It may seem quaint by today’s standards. If it were made with modern technology it would all be rendered in 3D and in real-time and nobody would care. But the creativity to realize this kind of vision with extremely limited technology is why it’s so impressive.

Getting a physical copy of Parasite Eve II is absurdly cost-prohibitive these days but thankfully it’s very cheap and easily accessible on PlayStation 3’s PSN. Like most PSONE Classics it can also be played on Sony’s portable consoles like the PSP and PS Vita. Either option is an excellent way to experience this Resi-like classic and is highly recommended.

Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare

Developer: Darkworks

Publisher: Inforgrames

Platforms: Windows PC Dreamcast Gameboy Color PlayStation PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 (via PSN)

Release Date: May 18 2001

Players: 1

Price: $5.99 USD (via PlayStation 3 PSN)

Alone in the Dark usually gets overshadowed by Resident Evil for being the first real Resi-like horror game. The fact of the matter is that the first few games were very much a product of their times and were works that were born from adversity. The limitations of computers at the time wouldn’t allow gameplay to be streamlined in the way Resident Evil would perfect.

The poetic irony is that though Alone in the Dark was the original survival-horror it would go on to eventually become more like Resident Evil in the 2001 reboot; Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare. Movement would become smoother with fluid animations and using weapons no longer required menu navigating; The New Nightmare had become streamlined and much more playable.

Despite being a reboot set in a more modern setting the core of The New Nightmare is still true to what made Alone in the Dark unique. Like in the original games players have a choice between Edward Carnby or a female character. In The New Nightmare the female option is Aline Cedrac and either option comes with their own bespoke gameplay quirks. Edward gets more combat and Aline gets to solve more puzzles.

The New Nightmare was a very late generation PlayStation release; which meant the developers were able to push the visuals and get the most out of the hardware. The PlayStation 2 had already been out for almost a year and even then the PS2 port wouldn’t happen ’til almost a year later and only in Europe.

As far as Resi-likes go The New Nightmare is above average and a lot of it has to do with its dense atmosphere that makes it an ideal candidate for a play-through during the fall season. Controls are solid both characters are very fluidly animated and are highly detailed for a PlayStation game.

What makes The New Nightmare stand out from other Resi-likes is how it uses light and darkness in its visuals and gameplay. The lighting effects are marvelous and very convincing. They go a long way in compounding on the dreary gloomy atmosphere while exploring dusty mansions while facing Lovecraftian creatures that emerge from the darkness.

Probably the reason why Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare didn’t find success was because it came so late in the PlayStation’s life; and that Resi-likes were becoming tired at the time. This is a well-made horror game that was a victim of timing. Today it would be much more accepted due to the rising popularity of Lovecraft concepts in narratives and that gamers are more accepting of Resi-like gameplay.

Another reason why The New Nightmare may have struggled is that it’s also a very challenging game. Some of the puzzles in Aline’s story veer close to being Myst-like; involving many steps and long animations. Edward’s story was no slouch either; often overwhelming players were terrible creatures that seemingly respawn forever.

Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare is available on PSN for PlayStation 3… For now. It goes for cheap digitally but God help the poor devil who tries to find a physical copy in decent condition at an affordable price.

Copies of the superior Dreamcast version are probably more attainable than on Sony’s platform. For the true horror maniacs there is a very interesting and impressive technological achievement for those who have a Gameboy Color.

Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare on Gameboy Color is unbelievable. The mad lads at Pocket Studios managed to demake an advanced PlayStation game into 8-bits and only 16 colors. This is not a 1:1 port however. Only Edward is playable the scenario has been substantially truncated and it also does not feature tank-controls; so it’s technically not a Resi-like.

Combat plays out very differently. It’s more like a random encounter system in a RPG but with running around the field and blasting foes with a huge gun. The visuals may not look like much when blown-up but when played on the intended display it’s very impressive and readable. The only exception is that Edward Carnby ends up looking more like a haggard and homeless wolfman.

This version proves that a portable Resident Evil on Gameboy Color didn’t have to turn out like Resident Evil: Gaiden. Once again Alone in the Dark still manages to beat Capcom to the punch by six months and be the true trail-blazer. This Gameboy Color version is absolutely worth checking out for those who really feel like they just gotta be chased by a Lovecraftian dog monster once in a while on the bus you know?

Athena ~ Awakening from the ordinary life ~

Developer: Vistec Yumekobo Co.

Publisher: SNK

Platforms: PlayStation PlayStation 2 (via Backwards compatibility) PlayStation Portable PlayStation Vita PlayStation 3 (via PSN)

Release Date: March 11 1999

Players: 1

Price: ¥660 (via PlayStation 3 Japanese PSN) (approx. $5.99)

The PlayStation was seemingly home to a majority of some of the best Resi-likes ever made and most of the ones developed in Japan were localized to the west. There was one very unusual Resi-like that was a very bizarre concept that has its origins as an arcade platformer but is more widely known for its connections to SNK’s King of Fighters series.

Athena ~ Awakening from the ordinary life ~ is one of the most stupefying Resi-likes on the PlayStation and anyone can play it with a little bit of know-how and elbow grease. While it may not have made it to the west it did get put on the Japanese PSN and is playable on any PlayStation 3. Why would anyone want this weird horror-inspired reboot of an obscure SNK character that is entirely in Japanese?

Athena is shockingly very playable without any knowledge of Japanese. None of the dialogue or flavor text will be understandable; but through the power of visuals players can figure out the meaning of things.

What can be easily gleaned is that Athena has emerging psychic powers that might have ties to a powerful cooperation that has managed to clone dinosaurs and is a leader in robotics. If this sounds wild it’s because it is.

What sets Athena apart from other Resi-likes is its approach to visuals and its rhythm game style combat system. The picture has about 1/3 of its real estate taken up by a permanent dialogue box that displays flavor text or command choices. Why this is important is because it cuts down on how much needs to be rendered on the image. Having less to render means higher resolution and more detailed graphics.

This cheeky approach to the realizing the visuals in Athena makes the 3D models appear almost a generation ahead of what was common at the time. Characters could almost pass for Dreamcast or arcade levels of fidelity and the backgrounds were crisp despite still being standard definition.

This made the developers consider the framing of each camera angle during cutscenes and while exploring the pre-rendered backgrounds as they had a much wider aspect ration due to the permanent text box. Athena ends up having a very distinct look and style from other Resi-likes on PlayStation and it’s bolstered by its unbelievably cinematic presentation that rivals Metal Gear Solid.

Usually when PlayStation games were multiple discs it was because they were RPGs with big time pre-rendered cutscenes and lots of recorded audio. There were a few two-disc outliers like the Oddworld games Resident Evil 2 Heart of Darkness Parasite Eve or Metal Gear Solid. Athena out did them all by being a whopping three-disc game.

The first disc alone is mostly pre-rendered computer animation that sets up the story with a lengthy English voiced sequence followed by Japanese only text set in a modern day 2018 Japan (from a game released in 1999). There is barely an hour of actual gameplay in the first disc. Make it past that and the experience balances itself out more evenly and has roughly 10 hours of gameplay.

Athena ~ Awakening from the ordinary life ~ is a wonderful oddity that that sadly was never localized and shockingly never got a fan translation. For something connected to a big name like King of Fighters and having a long legacy it’s tragic that Athena has been neglected.

Martian Gothic: Unification

Developer: Creative Reality

Publisher: Take-Two Interactive

Platforms: Windows PC PlayStation PlayStation 2 (via backwards compatibility)

Release Date: November 4 2001

Players: 1

Price: Cost Prohibitive

Two years before Resident Evil 0 introduced a real-time two-character switching mechanic Martian Gothic: Unification pulled it off with three. Unfortunately this is where the innovations end. This is a very derivative Resi-like that was aping off the popularity of horror games during the late 90s.

There were many sloppily made horror-games like this made around that time; The Crow: City of Angels and Vampire Countdown were infamous examples. While Martian Gothic is basically “Resident Evil in space” with its premise it does manage to have a bit more personality and tries to do something the other imitators do not.

Martian Gothic has complex puzzles and trying to solve them while juggling three characters and keeping them alive is genuinely stressful. Each character has their specialty and figuring out how to utilize their strengths is a large part of the experience; like Lost Vikings but in a Resi-like 90s horror game skin.

Martin Karne is the ex-soldier who has a natural propensity for violence against the Martian zombies. He is the go-to guy for most combat encounters and can use the best weapons. Kenzo is the techie who can use advanced computer systems and VR interfaces. Running into a machine related obstacle will demand Kenzo’s know-how.

Diane is the biologist manages a lot of the exposition and can get involved with non mechanical aspects of some puzzles. Most importantly Diane is the one who can make healing supplies. Since there are no herbs to mash together she is one of the most crucial characters as enemies can’t be permanently killed.

Martian Gothic is not just hard it’s also really sloppy. Many Resi-likes have fluid animation and responsive tank-controls but here they are mutilated. On top of being really stiff and sluggish with embarrassing animation; it’s frustratingly slow and will lead to unfair deaths from one-hit kill enemies.

A lot of the unfair qualities of Martian Gothic could be forgiven if it had a bit more personality. Aside from Kenzo all characters are boring and Kenzo is only fun because of how nonchalant he is about the situation he’s in. The character designs are also dull and tend to look alike in the low-res image quality of the PlayStation.

The backgrounds do look good as most pre-rendered backdrops tend to. The aesthetic has a very grungy and byzantine-industrial factory look to the base. Everything is filthy with rust and looks like it weighs several tons. It barely looks sci-fi and comes close to being fantasy.

Martian Gothic is a pretty haggard Resi-like that feels rushed and not thought out… Mostly because it was rushed and not thought out. It isn’t without its merits and is an interesting experience to play at least once. Sadly Martian Gothic has never been put on PSN and physical copies go absurdly high for such a rough game that is not especially well-made or enjoyable.

Evil Dead: Hail to the King

Developer: Heavy Iron Studios

Publisher: THQ

Platforms: Windows PC Dreamcast PlayStation PlayStation 2 (via backwards compatibility)

Release Date: December 5 2000

Players: 1

Price: cost prohibitive

There have been many games based on the Evil Dead film series dating back as far as 1984 on the Commodore 64. One would think that a concept as fertile as surviving an increasingly more powerful demonic threat while being alone in a cabin would make for video game gold. Sadly a vast majority of the Evil Dead games are as ramshackle as the low budget production values of the original film.

The one time Evil Dead got a competent survival-horror Resi-like was at the height of the genre’s popularity. Evil Dead: Hail to the King was originally met with scathing criticism due to its absurdly high difficulty and derivative gameplay. Replaying it today Hail to the King is not much worse than the average horror Resi-like of the day and the experience is elevated by the Evil Dead IP.

The crushing difficulty and aggressive unrelenting respawning enemies ultimately make a lot more sense than the haters would suggest. Hail to the King is aiming for an accurate Evil Dead experience; to put the player in Ash’s shoes. Anyone who has seen the films would tell you that Bruce Campbell’s character has a really bad time as the events unfold.

Hail to the King doesn’t get enough credit for how accurate and true it is to the Evil Dead experience. This is based on a series of sleazy and grotesque low budget movies and the tone and ambiance is very congruent with the the first three films.

Fans will be surprised by how much representation gets squeezed into Hail to the King; the opening chapter with Ash running around the woods and campgrounds has many elements from the first and second movies and lots of the visual cues are homaged tastefully.

The second half of the game has Ash sent back in time where the story takes some elements from Army of Darkness. The best part of all this is Hail to the King‘s narrative is connected to the films and is functionally the fourth Evil Dead movie the world never got. It’s not a deep plot but it is what fans would expect for a series founded on slapstick shenanigans with demonic possessions and chainsaw hands.

Hail to the King‘s x-factor is that it has Bruce Campbell breathing life into Ash’s character and the Evil Dead flavor set against an open-ended 90s style survival-horror Resi-like. A lot of the time it’s best to run away from threats and to conserve resources as much as possible; making this a more hardcore horror game than average.

The visuals are faithful to the films. Ash resembles himself and is on model down to his signature Dudley Do-Right chin. Playing the Dreamcast version is preferable since it drastically cleans up the image; but no matter what- both the PlayStation and Dreamcast copies will be extremely hard to find and will likely be expensive. There is no version on PSN either and interested players will be out of luck.

Why Hail to the King fetches such high price in the used game scene is a mystery. This isn’t a title that is not typically remembered fondly and was universally panned back in the day. Only players willing to be patient and approach the game with caution and determination will be able to appreciate Hail to the King‘s finer qualities.

Vampire Hunter D

Developer: Victor Interactive Software

Publisher: Jaleco USA

Platforms: PlayStation PlayStation 2 (via backwards compatibility)

Release Date: September 25 2000

Players: 1

Price: cost prohibitive

The original Vampire Hunter D anime movie was a big inspiration to the Castlevania series. A lot of visuals were directly lifted from the film along with a ton of classic Universal monsters movies and the Hammer films of the 70s. When it came time for D to finally get a video game it would not be a 2D action-platformer but a survival-horror Resi-like.

Vampire Hunter D on PlayStation is a very unusual mixture of ideas. Some of it works but a lot of it does not and it has to do with the game treading new ground by trying to be a Resi-like with melee swordplay. This is something that wouldn’t be perfected until Onimusha on PlayStation 2.

D‘s ambition is not completely fruitless; with a lot of practice and effort it can become playable. The action can be very stiff and there is no gradual difficulty climb. Vampire Hunter D begins difficult rarely letting up; and this is what is usually the brick wall for new gamers coming into it. On top of sticky combat the environments are massive leading to disorientation with puzzles as obtuse as Simon’s Quest.

The castle’s interiors are truly otherworldly and are unlike any environment in any horror game before it. Backgrounds resemble something more from an endgame PlayStation Final Fantasy game which gives D a lot of personality. The amount of hidden passages traps and switches makes the castle feel like an enemy that is constantly trying to kill D.

Since D is a dhampir he still has to feed which is going to be crucial as he swings his sword lethargically. Weakened enemies can be absorbed and doing so fills up the hand meter. When full D can do all sorts of things like resurrect from dying or a variety of deadly attacks that come in handy during boss battles. This aspect of the combat is the one part of fighting that does work well due to how effective it is.

This game is a tie-in to Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust; the anime movie that came out at the time and loosely follows the same story. There are anime cutscenes used that are recycled from the film but are extremely low quality. The narrative is very faithful to the film and is worth a play for anyone who wondered what it would be like if Castlevania and Resident Evil were combined.

The graphics hold up nicely like most pre-rendered Resi-likes tend to. D’s model is especially impressive and is very accurate to his appearance in Bloodlust. He looks incredibly cool and despite the game’s obvious flaws you want to be him because he is so awesome. Animation quality is decent but can be overly drawn out in some critical instances.

The only other horror-themed anime Resi-like was Devilman on PlayStation which sadly was never localized- so there aren’t too many options in this regard. D may lack polish but it can be fun if gamers are willing to play it on its terms and take their time. It’s also one of the lengthier Resi-likes of its kind; with play times reaching the 10 hour mark.

Regretfully Vampire Hunter D is only playable with a physical copy. Most retro tie-in games rarely see digital releases due to expiring licenses and this title fell victim to legal limbo. Since gamers have rediscovered Vampire Hunter D and realized it actually isn’t as bad as the media made it seem its become rare and expensive.

Covert Ops: Nuclear Dawn

Developer: Sugar and Rockets

Publisher: Activision

Platforms: PlayStation PlayStation 2 (via backwards compatibility)

Release Date: May 31 2000

Players: 1

Price: cost prohibitive

Resi-Likes on PlayStation tended to be horror themed and the only big name exceptions were the two Fear Effect games from Eidos. Along come Sugar and Rockets to release the only game they would make to reach the west and it be unlike any Resi-like by virtue of copying actionsploitation of the 90s.

Covert Ops: Nuclear Dawn is what happens when Under Siege 2: Dark Territory meets Resident Evil‘s gameplay. One would think that the developers would ape off Metal Gear Solid‘s style for tactical stealth action but here we are with tank-controls and fixed camera angles. Although Nuclear Dawn does steal Kojima’s style in UI design and font choices.

A train that is transporting a nuclear bomb has been hijacked by terrorists. Jack Morton is a NATO trooper who looks a lot like Nicholas Cage and it’s up to him to neutralize the threats. He will have to explore 19 compartments as well as engage in surprisingly polished stealth and action mechanics to outwit and outgun the terrorists.

Nuclear Dawn is not just all actionsploitation; this happens to be a thinking man’s Die Hard wannabe and has its share of puzzles to even out the action pacing. Despite it taking place on a speeding train the various compartments are well-designed and extremely varied.

There are moments when Jack will have to venture out on top of the train and will contend with icy slick surfaces while also avoiding gunfire from helicopters. There are so many delicious and nutritious 90s action movie pastiches that it’s hard to not be utterly endeared by the bombastic spectacle.

It’s a shame Nuclear Dawn was completely ignored. The Resi-like gameplay is extremely polished and is one of the more refined and varied examples of its kind. Even though it’s a blatant copy of fan favorite action films it does it all completely straight and without irony. This can make it feel generic because it doesn’t really have a style of its own and comes off as pandering to the west.

Having such a run-of-the-mill premise probably didn’t help it stand out at the time. Even worse yet- the PlayStation 2 was already out by the time Nuclear Dawn had its boring box with nondescript title on display on store shelves. What this needed was better marketing and a more imaginative title like “Showdown on the Nuclear Express” or “Psycho Train to Hell”.

The cool gray metallic surfaces and Hollywood-style lighting put Nuclear Dawn in a similar visual style as Metal Gear Solid. The cinematic flair due to the fixed angles gives the scenario a stylish presentation. The developer had never done anything like this before and the fact that the game is so confidently designed and has smooth tank-controls is impressive.

Too bad that Covert Ops: Nuclear Dawn never got a PSN release. Like all late generation PlayStation games that pushed the hardware it became rare and expensive. Since the growing nostalgia for Resi-likes has spread Nuclear Dawn has gained a small but dedicated following for its excellent gameplay and action movie heroics.

The City of Lost Children

Developer: Psygnosis

Publisher: Psygnosis

Platforms: DOS PlayStation PlayStation 2 (via backwards compatibility)

Release Date: March 31 1997

Players: 1

Price: cost prohibitive

The City of Lost Children was a 1995 French avant garde surrealist fantasy film by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. It was about a bunch of scientists who kidnap children for their dreams. The game follows this premise but has the perspective focus solely on Miette instead of focusing on the antagonist and his inability to dream.

Why this game was made and released almost two years after the movie is a mystery. The film had a following in the 90s but it was not exactly a huge blockbuster and the target audience were not exactly the kinds of people who would own a PlayStation. It was an arty dystopian European film with subtitles- there was no reason for Psygnosis to develop this. Yet here it is.

It’s nothing short of a miracle for such an obscure game to exist. Most people are not aware The City of Lost Children had a video game- even more surprising is that it happens to be a solid Resi-like. Unlike other entries mentioned prior The City of Lost Children does not have combat. Miette is a little girl and most of her enemies are adults so it wouldn’t be believable for her to take them out in any direct capacity.

This Resi-like has a lot more in common with point-and-click adventure games than it does with traditional survival horror. Miette will be exploring the industrial nightmarish city; looking for clues solving puzzles and generally avoiding adults. There will be usually more than one problem to negotiate at a time; allowing the player to approach the game at their own pace.

Navigation feels natural thanks to the fluent tank-controls and distinctive level design. The city itself is interesting to explore thanks to the beautifully composed shots for the fixed perspectives. The angles are memorable enough that is becomes easy to make a mental map of the environment and to explore with confidence.

The movie’s aesthetic and production design has been faithfully recreated. Jeunet and his crew created a very interesting world and being able to get further immersed in ways the film could not is a good enough reason for gamers who love the film to seek this out. Fans of the film will probably be shocked hearing so many English accents for characters who used to speak only French.

Most of the gameplay involves searching for things and putting the thing into a thing. It’s a very 90s adventure game experience and it’s an acquired taste for those who don’t mind hitting a wall once in a while. It’s too bad that there were no clips of the film used to better convey some of the story. Using narration with some scenes could have done wonders for exposition.

The City of Lost Children is a very short game for anyone who knows what they are doing and is only a pretty short game for everyone else who plays it casually. Even when getting stuck on an obtuse puzzle the play time will barely be padded out. It’s obvious that the poor devs didn’t have much time or money to flesh this game out as well as it needed since it’s also very linear and focused.

As expected from an art house French fantasy movie tie-in The City of Lost Children is absurdly rare and expensive. Most gamers will be out of luck trying to find a copy on PC or PlayStation and would be better off watching the movie while playing a few sessions of a favorite Resi-like of their choosing.

Resi-likes are a bizarre yet cinematically compelling sub-genre of games that used style to express their substance. While there were plenty that were on the rough side more often than not there were more quality titles than poor ones. Developers were just beginning to realize just how flexible Resi-like gameplay can be during the late 90s and early 2000s but then the entire gameplay philosophy just vanished.

Onimusha was able to prove that Resi-like gameplay could have excellent melee action and was the progenitor for what Devil May Cry would become. Grim Fandango confusingly used Resi-like gameplay to push the cinematic story-telling of the Lucasarts style adventure game.

There was even an anime style action Resi-like with T.R.A.G.; and a psychic druggie action-horror game with Galerians. The genre truly had no limits.

There are plenty other worthwhile Resi-likes out in the wild. Some are famous and some are completely unknown. A few Resi-likes happen to launch some of the biggest franchises in gaming history. Are there any Resi-likes you the gamers at home would be interested in playing? Which are your favorites? Tell and explain in the comments below!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9pbnRlcmFjdGl2ZS8yMDIxL3doYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQtdHJ1bXAtamFuLTYtaW5zdXJyZWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happened on Jan. 6: Trump stands back as rioters breach Capitol,"For 187 harrowing minutes the president watched his supporters attack the Capitol — and resisted pleas to stop them.

President Donald Trump had just returned to the White House from his rally at the Ellipse on Jan. 6 when he retired to his private dining room just off the Oval Office flipped on the massive flat-screen television and took in the show. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue thousands of his supporters were wearing his red caps waving his blue flags and chanting his name. Live television news coverage showed the horror accelerating minute by minute after 1:10 p.m. when Trump had called on his followers to march on the U.S. Capitol. The pro-Trump rioters toppled security barricades. They bludgeoned police. They scaled granite walls. And then they smashed windows and doors to breach the hallowed building that has stood for more than two centuries as the seat of American democracy. The Capitol was under siege — and the president glued to the television did nothing. For 187 minutes Trump resisted entreaties to intervene from advisers allies and his elder daughter as well as lawmakers under attack. Even as the violence at the Capitol intensified even after Vice President Mike Pence his family and hundreds of Congress members and their staffers hid to protect themselves even after the first two people died and scores of others were assaulted Trump declined for more than three hours to tell the renegades rioting in his name to stand down and go home. All in the first two hours. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement His “Make America Great Again” army was on the march just as he had commanded at the rally. The president had directed his followers to head to the Capitol in a forceful show of “pride and boldness” to pressure lawmakers to try to overturn the results of an election he falsely claimed had been rigged. And there they were literally fighting to keep Trump in power. An investigation by The Washington Post provides the richest understanding to date of Trump’s mindset and the cost of his inaction as democracy came under attack. It also reveals new aspects of an extensive pressure campaign by the president and those around him to get Pence to block certification of the election results — including a last-ditch appeal on the night of Jan. 6 after the riot was over by attorney John C. Eastman who urged Pence to reject electors as Congress reconvened. The Post’s investigation also found that signs of escalating danger were in full view hours before the Capitol attack including clashes that morning among hundreds of pro-Trump demonstrators and police at the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. The mounting red flags did not trigger stepped-up security responses that morning underscoring how unprepared law enforcement authorities were for the violence that transpired.

Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home

His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege

The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to take back control of the Capitol View all key findings As Trump watched on television as rioters broke into the Capitol he raged to those around him about the vice president. At 2:24 p.m. the very moment that Pence and his family were endangered by violent marauders calling him a traitor — “Hang Mike Pence!” some of them chanted — Trump made clear in a tweet whose side he was on: Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth! Jan. 6 2:24 p.m. Two minutes later Trump called Sen. Tommy Tuberville a newly elected Republican from Alabama who had been one of the president’s more outspoken allies propagating election fraud claims. “Coach how’s it going?” Trump asked the former Auburn University football coach. “Not very good Mr. President” Tuberville responded. “As a matter of fact they’re about to evacuate us.” “I know we’ve got problems” Trump responded.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) a Trump booster called him and said “You have to denounce this.” Trump falsely claimed to McCarthy that the rioters were members of antifa but McCarthy corrected him and said they were in fact Trump supporters. “You know what I see Kevin? I see people who are more upset about the election than you are. They like Trump more than you do” the president replied. “You’ve got to hold them” McCarthy said. “You need to get on TV right now you need to get on Twitter you need to call these people off.” Trump responded “Kevin they’re not my people.”

Seven hours to go The morning of Jan. 6 Donell Harvin Donell Harvin Close As the head of intelligence at D.C.'s homeland security office Harvin led a team that spotted warnings that extremists planned to descend on the Capitol and disrupt the electoral count. the head of intelligence at D.C.'s homeland security office pulled onto the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to head downtown from suburban Maryland and was surprised to find himself in heavy traffic. Then Harvin noticed the car in front of him had an out-of-state license plate. So did the one beside that. He realized he was surrounded. Every car he could see in front of him and in the rearview mirror had flags bumper stickers or other pro-Trump paraphernalia. Across from the FBI’s headquarters downtown some bureau personnel began the day mixing with MAGA protesters at an Au Bon Pain as they ordered coffee and breakfast. One official noticed a young man wearing a tactical vest and briefly wondered what made him think he needed to wear military-style gear to a political rally. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Cheney took to Twitter at 7:11 a.m. to denounce the effort by a growing number of her Republican colleagues to try to give Trump a second term by rejecting the electoral college results. Liz Cheney @Liz_Cheney We have sworn an oath under God to defend the Constitution. We uphold that oath at all times not only when it is politically convenient.



Congress has no authority to overturn elections by objecting to electors. Doing so steals power from the states & violates the Constitution. Jan. 6 7:11 a.m. On the drive to work Cheney spent much of her time trying to lock down assurances from fellow House leaders that she and any other Republican voting to certify Biden’s victory would be able to speak on the House floor during the day’s proceedings.

Park Police officers radioed in to say there were 500 to 800 people gathered some with giant banner flags. Play Listen to the dispatch Just then another officer at the Washington Monument radioed in: Play Listen to the dispatch These were bright red flags presaging the bloodshed to come. There were still two hours to go before Trump addressed the rally — and three hours before Congress was to convene to formally certify Joe Biden’s election as president. And yet law enforcement authorities declined to take action. Instructions came over the radio to all Park Police officers: Play Listen to the dispatch An officer explained the strategy of restraint: “We’re not going to agitate them.” At the White House Trump issued an unambiguous instruction at 8:17 a.m. to Pence who was preparing to preside over the joint session of Congress at 1 p.m. Donald J.

Five hours to go Around the city there was a carnival atmosphere at the various gatherings of protesters who believed they were not just witnessing history but helping create it with Biden’s victory about to be undone. Employees from D.C.'s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency fanned out from the White House to the Capitol in “mobile situational awareness teams” around 9 a.m. Teams near the White House reported an unusual sight: piles of backpacks hundreds of them from rallygoers leaving them outside rather than taking them through magnetometers and Secret Service checkpoints for Trump’s speech. The report resonated at D.C.’s homeland security center. During a tabletop exercise that the department had held a week earlier discarded bags were an indication of possible concealed weapons. In the Oval Office later that morning Trump hung around with family members and aides alternating between watching the television in his private dining room to check on the size of the crowd assembling at the Ellipse and reviewing with speechwriter Stephen Miller the scripted remarks he was set to deliver. Some of those around Trump including Kimberly Guilfoyle the girlfriend of the president’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr. indulged the fantasy that Pence would help overturn the election results. Trump and Pence spoke by phone that morning. It was a terse call as Pence reiterated what he had told the president the day before when they met face-to-face in the Oval Office: that he had no choice but to oversee the certification of the electoral college. Speaking from the Naval Observatory Pence explained that the vice president’s duty was ceremonial and that his authority was limited no matter how badly Pence may have wanted them to serve a second term. As the noontime festivities drew near there were more red flags. At 10:58 a.m. police recovered two firearms from an unattended vehicle north of the Mall. At 11:11 a.m. police found a vehicle near L’Enfant Plaza with a rifle and scope in plain view. And at 11:26 a.m. the Capitol Police investigated a tweet that said a militia was being formed on Capitol Hill. Outside the Capitol around 11:30 a.m. a conspicuously large contingent of Trump supporters arrived with a rowdy swagger: the Proud Boys a far-right group that engages in political violence. They stood out from the rest of the MAGA crowd dozens moving in semi-organized formation — loose columns of five across — as if they were militiamen. They were overwhelmingly male and almost exclusively White. Body armor bulged from under hoodies and jackets. They wore patches or gaiters with Confederate flags Punisher skulls and other extremist symbols. As they arrived on the scene murmurs of “the Proud Boys are here” went through the crowd and people moved to make a clearing. “Praise God!” one woman said.

Trump began speaking at the Ellipse at 11:57 a.m. Midway through his speech the president publicly pressured his vice president telling his supporters: “If Mike Pence does the right thing we win the election. … Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us and if he doesn’t that will be a sad sad day for our country.” A carnivallike atmosphere permeated the crowd who believed Biden's victory was about to be overturned.

Two hours to go Around noon at the Capitol Rep. Liz Cheney Rep. Liz Cheney Close The GOP congresswoman from Wyoming worked behind the scenes to make sure the Jan. 6 electoral count was not disrupted. Afterward she paid a steep political price. headed into the GOP cloakroom an anteroom just off the chamber floor where members gather to relax. Inside along the wall sat tables with stacks of paper on them. Republican members lined up to sign the sheets. Cheney poked her head around to see what they were signing. They were registering as co-sponsors to contest Biden’s victory in six key states. The situation outside was deteriorating. At 12:29 p.m. a Capitol Police officer reported hearing a Taser weapon fired near the Senate. And at 12:33 p.m. Park Police reported that they detained a person with a rifle on 17th Street near the World War II Memorial not far from where Trump was speaking on the Ellipse. Cheney’s phone rang. It was her father former vice president Richard B. Cheney who had been watching Trump invoke her by name. Now he feared for Liz’s safety. They discussed whether she should tone down the remarks she planned to deliver in support of Biden’s victory. “Should it affect what you’re going to do?” her father asked. After some discussion they agreed she should press on. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement At 12:36 p.m. Pence arrived at the Capitol. As the motorcade drew near one of his staffers was struck by the scale of the crowd. Pence brought his wife Karen and daughter Charlotte along with him to the Capitol where they were joined by his brother Greg a Republican congressman from Indiana. The vice president didn’t have them accompany him to enjoy a historic day. He knew he might need them by his side for emotional support. As Pence entered the Capitol his office released the letter to Congress. The finality of its conclusions sent shock waves through Trump’s orbit and beyond. See full document Vice President Pence “As a student of history … I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session Congress...” Midway through Trump’s speech about 12:45 p.m. Capitol Police officers along with agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives were dispatched to investigate reports of a pipe bomb with a timer found outside the Republican National Committee headquarters and suspicious packages at the Supreme Court and near the Democratic National Committee headquarters — all offices close to the Capitol. The activity proved a distraction for officers guarding the Capitol. A D.C. homeland security official assigned to keep eyes on the swelling crowd was sitting in a black SUV on the east side of the Capitol by a row of Capitol Police bomb-squad trucks. Suddenly officers jumped into several of the trucks near him. Half pulled away to the south. Several more took off to the west. The official realized his SUV was now one of the last remaining vehicles and that fewer than 10 officers remained between the Capitol and the growing number of protesters. The official called Donell Harvin Donell Harvin Close As the head of intelligence at D.C.'s homeland security office Harvin led a team that spotted warnings that extremists planned to descend on the Capitol and disrupt the electoral count. who said the bomb squads were responding to the suspicious package reported near the RNC building. The two flashed back to their tabletop exercise on Dec. 30 and how an analyst had imagined a scenario in which improvised explosive devices could be used to distract law enforcement before an attack on the Capitol. “Is this really happening?” the official asked Harvin. The president commanded the crowd to march to the Capitol to give lawmakers the “boldness” needed “to take back our country.” A limited number of police officers were there to meet them.

Williamson/The Washington Post; The Blaze; Amanda Voisard for The Washington Post) Trump continued roaring at the Ellipse but some in the crowd there started migrating to the Capitol. At 12:46 p.m. Capitol Police began executing protocols to keep the peace. Officers were dispatched to block side streets as a precaution against possible vehicle rammings. This essentially created a protected funnel for the protesters straight toward the Capitol. Just before 1 p.m. at D.C.’s homeland security agency headquarters about four miles south of the Capitol Harvin and his analysts were watching a variety of live-stream footage broadcast from some of the people they had been most concerned about coming to the city. One angle showed rioters pushing in toward the scaffolding for the inauguration stage. Harvin ran out to the larger emergency operations center room. The crowd looked like it was storming the Capitol. A city official pointed to CNN which was displaying images of Pence and Congress meeting inside. “That’s not what’s on television” the official said. “It’s going to be” Harvin fired back.

Back at the Ellipse Trump was finishing his speech and the leader’s edict rang through the city like a call to arms. “If you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore” he said. “We are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue — I love Pennsylvania Avenue — and we are going to the Capitol.” And then at 1:10 p.m. he told the crowd to march to “try and give [lawmakers] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.” Trump's edict rang through the city like a call to arms.

60 minutes to go Douglas Jensen hadn’t come to Washington planning to enter the Capitol but he obeyed Trump’s call to march down Pennsylvania Avenue. Jensen hadn’t slept in more than a day when he started walking toward the white dome and was determined to make it inside and witness what he called “the storm” — a declaration of martial law and the arrests of lawmakers who insisted on certifying Biden as the next president. Douglas Jensen That's all about to change ;) Near the Capitol a throng of Proud Boys stood around listening to a live stream of Trump’s speech. It was hard to hear the president’s words over the noise of the crowd but when he urged demonstrators to descend on the Capitol the news quickly spread from person to person. It was received as a command among the Proud Boys who were openly radioing with each other over the walkie-talkie app Zello and casting themselves as revolutionaries. “1776!” one man called out. “1776!” fellow marchers responded. “Whose Capitol? Our Capitol!” they chanted. Law enforcement officials heard people chant “F--- Biden” and “Pelosi’s a pedo” a reference to baseless claims about pedophilia that had spread widely among QAnon followers. Inside the FBI’s decaying concrete Brutalist headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue agents and analysts working at their desks could hear the loud chants of Trump supporters walking toward the Capitol. “FBI traitors!” they shouted. “F--- the FBI!” Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement The closer people got to the Capitol building the more frenzied and out of control the mob became. The only visible security were police in the distance. Largely unimpeded protesters pushed through barrier after barrier. At 12:55 p.m. Capitol Police directed all available units to the western front of the Capitol to assist with breaches and officers inside were instructed to lock some doors. Protesters clashed violently with the few police officers they encountered on the scene. As police rapidly lost control outside the Capitol lawmakers and staffers were gathered inside the House chamber for the joint session which had gotten underway at 1 p.m. The procedural tallying of vote counts began state by state in alphabetical order but was quickly interrupted by a Republican challenge to Arizona’s tally.

She had just pulled meatloaf from the oven and sat down with her 10-year-old son Christian before he was to spend the rest of the day with babysitters. The commander for a Capitol Police civil disturbance unit Mendoza was about to head into work for her shift in the Capitol starting at 3 p.m. By then hundreds of people were encroaching on the Capitol. People climbed trees jumped on scaffolding scaled walls and searched for staircases — looking for any way inside the building. Pepper spray wafted over the crowd creating an acrid haze. “Break open the gate!” one man yelled his voice bellowing over the crowd. “We're not going to be scared! We're not backing down! You mess with American people this is what you get!” This was a full-blown riot. Largely unimpeded protesters pushed through barrier after barrier.

Despite having said he would go to the Capitol there was no apparatus set by the Secret Service or White House staff to make his movement happen. Some aides checked to see whether there had been a change of plan but there was not one. At 1:45 p.m. rioters discovered that the path leading to the Senate side of the Capitol was unguarded. Men in militia-style gear helped direct people toward that entrance pushing through at least three more layers of flimsy portable barriers. A lone Black officer in a Capitol Police uniform walked toward the scene. His radio crackled. “Oh it’s blocked off” he muttered in surprise shaking his head. He took one look at the amped-up White mob before him and left. At 1:50 p.m. the D.C. police commander declared a riot at the Capitol. Outside the Capitol some rioters tried to reason with about 10 officers who were struggling to stand their ground on the building’s steps. “This is not going to end well for you” one of them told the officers. “Look at the numbers. Just go now before it gets ugly. Just stand down.” The officers smirked but kept fighting to hold back the rioters. Within minutes however they were overpowered. The path to the doors was clear.

Trump!” At 1:59 p.m. the first rioters reached the Capitol’s windows and doors and attempted to break inside. At 2:05 p.m. the first fatality was declared: Kevin Greeson a Trump supporter from Alabama suffered a heart attack just outside the building on the Capitol grounds. By now the joint session had disbanded over objections from Republicans to Arizona's vote tally and the two chambers split to debate the matter individually. In the Senate chamber where Pence was presiding at the rostrum and Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) was delivering a speech arguing against certifying the vote Sen.

The Capitol is breached At 2:11 the first rioters gained access to the building by using lumber and a police shield to break a window. Romney walked off the floor and headed in the direction of his small hideaway office but at 2:12 p.m. encountered Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman who had been running down a second-floor hallway outside the Senate chamber. Goodman motioned for Romney to turn around to avoid rioters. “There are people not far. You’ll be safer inside” Goodman told Romney. Shaken he returned to the Senate floor. At 2:13 p.m. Pence was hastily removed by his Secret Service detail and rushed through a side door to his ceremonial office nearby along with his family members. The Pences came harrowingly close to danger as rioters chanting his name charged up the stairs to that precise landing about a minute later. The Senate went into an emergency recess. At a landing Goodman turned around and made as if he was going to hit Jensen with the baton. “Back up!” Goodman shouted. “Hit me I’ll take it” Jensen said. “I will take it for my country.” Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Goodman turned again to run. “Second floor!” he shouted into his radio as he took the stairs two at a time warning fellow officers that the crowd was on the move. Jensen ran after him his arms pumping. At 2:14 p.m. Goodman reached the second floor. He turned around again to face Jensen and the crowd. He was standing only a few feet away from a set of doors to the Senate chamber and less than 100 feet from the office where Pence was hiding. Goodman looked to his left toward that office. Then he pushed Jensen in the chest and started walking toward the right where a line of police officers was waiting. Jensen followed and so did the rioters behind him. “What’s the point of stopping us at this point?” Jensen said to one officer in an exchange captured on video obtained by The Post as rioters’ yells echoed off the marble walls. “That's as far as it's going to go” the officer declared. “Then go arrest the vice president!” Jensen said. The Senate and House adjourned as rioters marched through the Capitol and eventually entered the chambers and lawmakers' offices.

Carneysha Mendoza Capt. Carneysha Mendoza Close A 19-year veteran of the Capitol Police Mendoza led officers battling rioters in the Rotunda of the Capitol on Jan. 6.’s radio. “Capitol Rotunda.” “10-33.” That is the department’s call of last resort alerting that officers are in trouble. Mendoza turned around and sped to the southeast corner of the Capitol. She wanted to get to the Rotunda stat. She entered through a ground-floor entrance known by Capitol Police as Memorial Door because of a plaque affixed to a wall there honoring two officers killed in 1998. Mendoza stepped through an inner set of glass doors and came face-to-face with a crowd of roughly 200 rioters blocking her path to the Rotunda. She turned back to exit and find a safer route. But in the seconds that had elapsed the crowds were now outside. Mendoza could hear banging on the door and yelling outside. She was trapped. With no protective gear Mendoza raised her arms and started pushing her way through the crowd yelling as she had taught her riot-control teams to do: “Get back! Get back! Get back!” Mendoza made her way through a hallway to a line of police officers near the Rotunda who were trying to keep the crowd from penetrating deeper into the building. She fell in line and tried to help but the police were already being pushed back. Mendoza’s arm got wedged between a railing and the wall but a sergeant was able to pull her free. At 2:19 p.m. Capitol Police emailed an urgent bulletin to all congressional staff: From: U.S. Capitol Police To: All congressional staff Sent: Jan. 6 2:19 p.m. Capitol staff: Due to a security threat inside the building immediately:

- Move inside your office or the nearest office.

- Take emergency equipment and visitors.

- Close lock and stay away from external doors and windows.

- If you are in a public space find a place to hide or seek cover.

- Remain quiet and silence electronics.

- Once you are in a safe location immediately check in with your OEC.

- No one will be permitted to enter or exit the building until directed by USCP.

- If you are in a building outside of the affected area remain clear of the police activity.

He was pleased by thousands of his supporters storming the Capitol. Trump tweeted at 2:24 p.m.: Donald J.

USA demands the truth! Jan. 6 2:24 p.m. At this very instant the Secret Service was scrambling to keep Pence safe producing a remarkable moment of tension between agents and their protectee. Tim Giebels the lead special agent in charge of Pence’s protective detail had twice asked the vice president to evacuate but he refused. “I’m not leaving the Capitol” Pence had told Giebels. He feared the image of his departing motorcade might provide vindication to the insurrectionists. When Giebels asked a third time at 2:26 p.m. it was an order. “They’re in the building” the special agent told Pence. “The room you’re in is not secure. There are glass windows. I need to move you. We’re going.” The vice president and his family and aides were led on a safe path down a staircase to a secured subterranean area that rioters couldn’t reach. Pence’s armored limousine was parked there and Giebels asked him to get inside.

Eastman who had been working out of a “command center” of rooms in the Willard hotel with Rudolph W. Giuliani and other Trump lawyers and advisers wrote to Jacob who was hiding from the mob with the Pences and other senior aides: “The ‘siege’ is because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary to allow this to be aired in a public way so that the American people can see for themselves what happened.” Senators were rushed out of the chamber.

30 minutes in Inside the House chamber scores of lawmakers were worried for their own safety and unsure what to do. Some members of Congress rapidly lost faith about their security when they saw Capitol Police officers stationed with them anxiously trying to determine who had the keys to lock the doors from the inside. “It seemed like they knew less about what was happening than we did” Jayapal said. “Everyone felt unprotected but we were stuck there.” The House chaplain led a prayer. A Capitol Police officer said that the backs of lawmakers’ seats were bulletproof and that if rioters broke into the chamber people should hide behind them. “Get down under your chairs if necessary” the officer instructed. “Just be prepared. Stay calm.” The Capitol Police directed members to put on their gas masks because tear gas had been deployed outside. The order was met by blank stares from members who had never been trained to use the masks. Some did not even know where they were located. Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) a trained emergency room physician helped Wild rip off the zipper and remove thick foil inside the bag to unveil the mask. As Rep. Paul A.

At 2:44 p.m. a shot echoed in the halls. A Capitol Police officer killed Ashli Babbitt as she attempted to force entry into the Speaker’s Lobby adjacent to the House chamber. Inside the chamber lawmakers assumed the worst and realized they could soon be overrun by violent intruders. Jayapal thought the rioters were shooting into the chamber. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) comforted her friend Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) in prayer. Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.) called her mother. Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.) who has since disclosed lasting mental trauma sparked by his experience called his family and began to say goodbye after understanding the gravity of the situation; there was a chance he would not make it out alive. Wild pulled out her phone to find dozens of texts from her son and daughter as they watched news reports from home. She surprised herself as she figured out how to FaceTime her 28- and 25-year-olds. Her son said “How can you say you’re okay if we can hear the gunshot and the glass shattering?” After hanging up with her children Wild homed in on possibly dying and becoming “a source of worry” for her children. Wild told herself: “You’re going to make it out of here Susan. You’re going to get out of here because your kids need you to get out of here.” Soon Wild was lying on the ground. Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) held her hand. Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) comforted Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.).

Fight-or-flight instincts began to kick in for Jayapal as she moved her walking stick to her right hand — her dominant one — so she could hit anyone who came near her. “I was starting to plan that I might die and if I was going to then I was going to go down fighting” she said. Members discussed how they would position themselves if the mob were to burst through the doors. Crow suggested that members take their pins off so that the rioters could not identify them as the elected officials they wanted to kill. Just removing a pin was not a solution for every lawmaker however. While all were under threat the danger was particularly acute for lawmakers of color whose identity made them a visible target for the overwhelmingly White throng. “For many of us we can’t hide what we look like” Jayapal said. “We can’t run over and hide in a group of Republicans and we can’t take off a jacket to blend into a White crowd which was a very very real dynamic as we were watching Confederate flags being raised with horrible racist messages.” Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement As rioters pushed their way into the Speaker’s Lobby their hatred and zeal was evident. When Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn ordered them to leave the Capitol some yelled back: “President Trump invited us here!” “Nobody voted for Joe Biden!” In a rare instance of injecting politics into his job Dunn replied: “I voted for Joe Biden. Does my vote not count? Am I nobody?” Rioters then hurled racial epithets at Dunn who is Black. “You hear that guys?” one woman said. “This n----r voted for Joe Biden!” Congressional staff members scrambled to barricade doors and evacuate.

45 minutes in Law enforcement authorities scrambled. In the weeks leading up to Jan. 6 as the FBI had received more and more reports of threats of violence on far-right online forums and social media channels Bowdich the agency’s deputy director had decided to have three tactical teams ready to deploy — a SWAT team in Washington a Baltimore-based SWAT team positioned just outside the District and a Hostage Rescue Team also a short drive away. They all responded to the Capitol that day but they were small specialized teams not the kind of overwhelming manpower necessary to turn the tide of a riot. “FBI and ATF agents can be accountants lawyers chemists” said Marc Raimondi a former longtime Justice Department spokesman. “They’re not trained in riot control or traffic control. Obviously they are versatile but when the Justice Department is your 911 plan for a riot something’s gone drastically wrong.” The federal government’s top law enforcement official acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen was alone in his office. He’d given much of his staff permission to work from home on the assumption that street closures the rally and general concern about possible unrest could make it difficult to get downtown in addition to the preexisting coronavirus concerns. But now with the siege beginning Rosen juggled an onslaught of phone calls hopping back and forth between his desk phone in one hand and cellphone in the other. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Rosen from their secure location to ask him to urgently send reinforcements to the Capitol. Rosen assured them that he already had instructed any nearby federal agent to rush to the scene. Frustrated by what they felt was Rosen’s noncommittal answer to their demand Schumer and Pelosi issued a joint statement urging Trump to call off the rioters. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement At the same time a series of urgent conference calls were underway among law enforcement military municipal and congressional officials. Sund had called Maj. Gen. William Walker commander of the D.C. National Guard before 2 p.m. to request immediate help. Walker relayed the request to the Pentagon where only the acting secretary of defense Christopher C. Miller could give the okay. But after a half-hour no approval had come. Around 2:30 p.m. Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt director of the Army staff told D.C. officials on a conference call that it would not be his best military advice to send in the Guard. He argued that soldiers ringing the Capitol would create bad “optics.” The Army was not denying the requests Piatt later testified. The service just wanted a clear plan in place before taking what leaders saw as a serious step to deploy armed guardsmen at the Capitol. Before 3 p.m. units of reinforcements from federal and neighboring law enforcement agencies arrived to help the beleaguered Capitol Police. Members of a specially trained D.C. police disturbance unit commandeered a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority bus to get close to the Capitol. Officers from Prince George’s County Md. arrived to help gain control of the north side of the West Terrace while officers from Montgomery County Md. and Arlington County Va. pressed up a staircase on the west side. Virginia State Police officers battled rioters under the mid-level terrace on the west side. At 2:52 p.m. the first FBI SWAT teams arrived at the Capitol. In total 520 federal agents from a hodgepodge of agencies responded to an urgent call to help at the Capitol from the Justice Department. It was throwing bodies at a crisis.

Police had locked the doors but mistakenly left one in the gallery unlocked which some of the rioters used to enter. The chamber looked smaller in real life than it did on television. About two dozen other Trump supporters were inside. “Guys please don’t wreck anything in here” Hodgkins told his compatriots. Hodgkins made his way to the well holding his Trump flag right next to the desk where Pence had been sitting just 40 minutes earlier to certify Biden’s win. “Let’s all say a prayer in this sacred space” declared the shirtless face-painted “QAnon Shaman” Jacob Anthony Chansley who stood behind the desk wielding a bullhorn as several other men bowed their heads. “Thank you heavenly father for gracing us with this opportunity. … Thank you heavenly father for this opportunity to stand up for our God-given unalienable rights. … Thank you for filling this chamber with patriots that love you and that love Christ.” Police would soon enter the chamber and by about 3:15 p.m. Hodgkins would follow their orders to leave. “I couldn’t believe that I walked into the Senate so easily” Hodgkins recalled. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Trump’s refusal to act to stop the siege and his continuing abuse of Pence resonated among Republican lawmakers some of whom privately confided that the president’s utter absence of empathy for his loyal No. 2 was appalling. “They never did anything about it but it turned them off” said one House Republican describing a consensus view among many of his colleagues. Some aides huddled in the area just outside the Oval Office where Trump’s receptionist had her desk hoping the president would wave them in and ask for their advice. But Trump was not seated behind the Resolute Desk; he was holed up in his private dining room where the television was turned on and some aides did not want to intrude on him there. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie Trump’s longtime friend and adviser tried but failed to reach the president and so sought to deliver a message to him through the television by calling into George Stephanopoulos’s live broadcast on ABC. Two recently departed senior White House officials former senior counselor Kellyanne Conway and former communications director Alyssa Farah relayed messages to Trump through intermediaries. Alyssa Farah If someone doesn’t say something people will die Meadows did not respond. Since rioters breached the security barricades outside the Capitol some of the president’s most trusted advisers including his daughter and Meadows tried to persuade him to direct his supporters to disperse. They felt Trump’s 2:38 p.m. tweet telling people to “Stay peaceful!” missed the mark. Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful! Jan. 6 2:38 p.m. Ivanka Trump shuttled between her second-floor West Wing office where she watched the riot unfold on television and the president’s dining room where he was watching television trying to persuade her dad to use stronger language to bring an end to the insurrection. But just when she thought she had gotten him into the right head space Meadows would call her because the president still was unconvinced. Trump was being worked from multiple angles. This was around the same time that Kevin McCarthy House minority leader called the president practically begging him to denounce the riots. At 3:13 p.m. Trump tweeted a new message one that again fell short of what those around him felt was necessary. Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember WE are the Party of Law & Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you! Jan. 6 3:13 p.m. Ivanka Trump retweeted her father’s message at 3:15 p.m. and addressed the rioters as “American Patriots.” She deleted her tweet a few minutes later after it was roundly criticized. Ivanka Trump @IvankaTrump American Patriots - any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable.



The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful. Jan. 6 3:15 p.m. Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump Bad apples like ANTIFA or other crazed leftists infiltrated today’s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! Draft Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump The fake news media who encouraged this summer’s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions. This isn’t who we are! Our people should head home and let the criminals suffer the consequences! Draft Both statements were belligerent and twisted the truth in redirecting blame for the riots but nevertheless urged his supporters to end the insurrection. Trump sent neither. Instead Trump stewed in his grievance: over what he saw as Pence’s betrayal over blame in the media of him and his supporters for the death and destruction at the Capitol and ultimately over the fact that his final attempt to overturn the election results was about to fail.

The second hour As the afternoon hurtled on the rioters were pushing through the Capitol with greater ferocity and in higher numbers. Gina Bisignano a salon owner from Beverly Hills Calif. egged on the violent crowd with a megaphone. Authorities still had not regained control of the Capitol as the 4 o’clock hour arrived. The top House and Senate leaders had been evacuated to Fort McNair an Army post in Southwest Washington along the Anacostia River. Rep. Liz Cheney Rep. Liz Cheney Close The GOP congresswoman from Wyoming worked behind the scenes to make sure the Jan. 6 electoral count was not disrupted. Afterward she paid a steep political price. and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) the Democratic caucus chairman were the highest-ranking members of the House still on Capitol grounds and had been conferring through much of the afternoon. Outside a secure committee room across the street from the Capitol Cheney saw Jeffries and brought up the topic of impeaching Trump. Trump still had not addressed the crisis on camera or instructed his supporters to go home when at 4:05 p.m. Biden appeared on television from Wilmington Del. Senators from both parties watching from their secure room at the Capitol complex applauded. “It was like wow we have a leader who said what needed to be said” Romney said. Trump followed Biden by posting on Twitter at 4:17 p.m. a video of his own remarks about the siege. He had begun recording it in the Rose Garden before Biden’s live address and Trump aides were upset that by speaking first the Democrat came across as more statesmanlike. Trump’s message was ambiguous. He opened his speech by repeating his lie that the election was rigged. He told his supporters to “go home” but immediately added: “We love you. You’re very special.” Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump Jan. 6 4:17 p.m. During the videotaping Trump did not stick to the script his speechwriters had composed and had to record at least three takes to get one that his aides felt was palatable enough to share with the public. “That was actually the best one” a senior White House official said. The officer lay on his back in the middle of the archway using his baton to fight off assaults. Footage shows Jeffrey Sabol wearing a helmet appearing suddenly and wrestling the baton out of the officer’s hand leaving him to defend himself with only his hands. Around the time Sabol took the baton another rioter used a metal crutch to beat on police standing in the archway. The man wielding the crutch climbed over a low fence grabbed a second officer and pulled him headfirst down a set of stairs and into the mob. Sabol was right there his hand on the second officer’s back. Then with a flagpole flying an American flag a third rioter beat the second officer who was captured on camera lying facedown in the crowd. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Sabol was photographed holding the stolen baton over the back of the second officer’s neck as he lay prone and defenseless. Later Sabol described himself as a “patriot warrior” who was protecting the officer from his fellow rioters. But he said he couldn’t remember whether he had hit the second officer himself because court records say “he was in a fit of rage and details are cloudy.” In an August court filing Sabol’s lawyer says he “vehemently denies” hitting the officer with the baton. The officer from whom Sabol had stolen the baton was also dragged into the crowd where rioters ripped off his helmet Maced him and stomped on him. He required staples in his head.

Also known as carbon neutrality it requires entities to remove as much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as they release into it through efforts like restoring forests using carbon capture technologies or buying carbon offsets.

At the UN Climate Change Conference also known as COP26 and which begins today the topic of how world leaders plan to reduce emissions and meet the goals set by the 2015 Paris Agreement to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 will be front and center.

But there is another environmental pledge that several companies are now taking focused on water.

Often called ""water positive"" it centers on making water-intensive processes more efficient and putting more water back into a geographic area where a company operates than it takes out something that is becoming more of a focus as water crises like shortages overuse and droughts impact areas across the globe including across the western United States. The UN is currently predicting a 40% shortfall in freshwater resources by 2030.

That has led companies from BP to Facebook to Gap to all make pledges to replenish more water than used in their direct operations in the coming years. Water conservation is also a focus for a new color-dyeing process created by Ralph Lauren and Dow for a fabric-dyeing industry that uses trillions of gallons of water a year.

PepsiCo announced a plan in August that includes replenishing more than 100% of water used at all high-water-risk sites by 2030 while also reducing water use by 50%.

""The goal is really twofold"" Jim Andrew PepsiCo chief sustainability officer said at CNBC's ESG Impact summit on Thursday. ""We're looking at the entire value chain. It's really about how do we reduce across the whole system the absolute amount of water that's used. Everywhere in that chain. And then second how do we replenish more than we end up using?""

Pepsi's plan would cover more than 1000 company-owned and third-party facilities globally and Andrew said its partners ""understand the business case and the imperative.""

For example Pepsi's Mexican brand Sabrita worked with a franchise bottler to take processing water used in ingredient processing and treat it so it became drinkable and then used it in a different food plant to wash potatoes. Andrew said that was able to reduce freshwater demand by 50%.

""This is the kind of example where we can work as a system; we can collaborate and we're looking to replicate that in as many places as we can.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTEwLTMxL2RjLXNuaXBlci1zZXJpYWwta2lsbGVycy1yYWNlLXRydWUtY3JpbWUtYW5kLXRlcnJvcmlzbS8xMDA1NjY3MTDSAShodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTAwNTY2NzEw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two serial killers struck fear in America.

The company is also investing in a new facility in the Shanghai Lin-Gang area a semiconductor industry cluster designated by the city government.

Semiconductor production is a priority in China’s latest five-year plan as the world’s second-largest economy braces for a heightened tech war with the US. China’s output of integrated circuits (ICs) reached a monthly record in July on the back of strong demand and the addition of new production capacity.

Established just over two decades ago in Shanghai Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) is considered the country’s national champion in producing chips used in various electronics products from smartphones and computers to cars and mobile base stations.

Tapping experienced semiconductor talent from Taiwan the mainland Chinese chip foundry has been able quickly move up the technology ladder since it was established.

However SMIC’s ability to close the technology gap with chip foundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) has been stymied by US trade sanctions  imposed because of its alleged ties to the Chinese military – a charge the firm denies. As a result SMIC is focusing on mature technology nodes – which are now in high demand due to the increased use of chips in a wide range of consumer applications.

Here is all you need to know about China’s chip champion SMIC and how it is leading Beijing’s drive for semiconductor self-sufficiency.

What is SMIC and what are its connections to Taiwan?

SMIC was established in April 2000 by Richard Chang Rugin who made a career of building new wafer fabs during two decades at US chip maker Texas Instruments.

Many of SMIC’s engineers as well as key senior managers were recruited from Taiwan with TSMC being a primary target for talent.

Chang stepped down as CEO of SMIC in November 2009 three days after the company settled a years-long lawsuit with TSMC which had sued Chang’s company for alleged theft of intellectual property by hiring former TSMC employees.

Since 2017 SMIC has operated a shared senior management arrangement with Zhao Haijun and Liang Mong Song appointed co-CEOs in October of that year.

Zhao joined the company in October 2010 with 28 years of experience in the industry while Liang came to SMIC with 35 years of experience including senior positions in research and development at TSMC until 2009.

Another ex-TSMC executive was hired by SMIC in December 2020. Chiang Shang-yi was appointed vice-chairman after a 40-year career in the semiconductor industry including as head of the TSMC R&D team.

SMIC’s co-CEOs reportedly have different agendas. Liang backed an aggressive leading-edge strategy for SMIC which put him at odds with Zhao who preferred to develop commercially viable products using older technology according to a report by the Financial Times last year.

How does SMIC fit into China’s self-sufficiency ambitions?

As China’s biggest and most advanced chip maker SMIC is considered the country’s national champion in Beijing’s drive to establish self-sufficiency in semiconductors amid the US-China tech war.

Chip production is a priority in China’s latest five-year plan as the country braces for a heightened tech war with the US. China’s output of integrated circuits (ICs) rose more than 41 per cent year on year to 31.6 billion units in July a monthly record on the back of strong demand and the addition of new production capacity.

will cover a land area equal to about five football fields and mainly produce display driver and power management chips using mature technologies according to a document published by the government of Shenzhen’s Pingshan district. SMIC’s new Beijing plant with a total investment of nearly 50 billion yuan (US$7.7 billion) is expected to start operations in 2024 with monthly production capacity of 100000 12-inch silicon wafers. Its new Shenzhen plant meanwhile

SMIC derives more than half its wafer revenues from mainland China and Hong Kong while smartphone chips are its biggest market accounting for 44.4 per cent of wafer revenue last year.

SMIC generates the bulk of its sales from mature technology nodes which accounted for 37.5 per cent of its total in the first quarter of 2021.

How has SMIC been affected by the US-China tech war?

In October 2020 the US Department of Commerce designated SMIC as a “military end user” restricting it from using US technologies.

Then in December that year SMIC was added to the Entity List on the grounds of US national security and foreign policy interests. This further restricted the company from purchasing US chip manufacturing equipment requiring a licence to be issued before shipments can be made.

The US Commerce Department has said it will apply a “presumption of denial” for products required to produce chips at the 10-nanometre and below node. The restriction will hinder SMIC’s ability to import extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanners sold by Dutch company ASML.

In its fourth quarter results released in February  SMIC reported that its share of wafer revenue from advanced 14-nm and 28-nm processing nodes fell by a large margin from the earlier July-September quarter due to the loss of a “big customer” – believed to be Huawei Technologies Co which is also subject to US trade sanctions.

What is it doing to cope with US sanctions?

US trade restrictions imposed on SMIC for its alleged links to the Chinese military – a charge it denies – continue to cloud its prospects for moving up the technology ladder although recent export licence approvals show that the Chinese company has not been completely cut off from US technology.

From November 2020 to April 2021 suppliers to SMIC received 188 licences worth US$42 billion to sell products to the Chinese foundry according to a recent Reuters report citing documents obtained from the US Congress.

In March SMIC secured supplies of deep ultraviolet lithography systems from Dutch firm ASML in an amended purchase agreement worth US$1.2 billion which could help ensure the Chinese firm’s capacity expansion for more mature nodes.

Company vice-chairman Chiang Shang-yi believes SMIC should focus on developing advanced packaging technologies that can cram more circuits into smaller packages to overcome its weakness in nanometre process nodes.

In chip packaging SMIC has previously invested in specialist companies in this field. It holds 12.86 per cent equity in China’s JCET Group the third largest IC packaging and testing company after ASE of Taiwan and Amkor of South Korea.

Will SMIC ever be a world leader in making chips?

SMIC ranks No 5 among the top 10 foundries with a market share of 5 per cent behind TSMC Samsung Electronics United Microelectrnics Corp and GlobalFoundries according to Taiwan-based market research firm TrendForce (see chart).

Source: TrendForce and public documents

However with first quarter revenue of just over US$1 billion SMIC is dwarfed by No 1 player TSMC which reported first-quarter revenue of US$12.9 billion.

SMIC’s lack of access to EUV technology will mean it cannot produce more advanced chips hindering its attempts to catch up to TSMC in terms of technology development. However mature technology nodes from 350-nm to 28-nm are what most Chinese semiconductor design companies need especially those designing chips for Internet of Things and car applications.

All three of the new fabs that SMIC is building in Beijing Shanghai and Shenzhen are focused on the mature 28-nm technology node.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3My5uaGsub3IuanAvbmhrd29ybGQvZW4vbmV3cy9iYWNrc3Rvcmllcy8xODAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Afghan refugee — and Taliban target — recounts his harrowing journey to America | NHK WORLD-JAPAN News,"We’re on the phone with one of Hasib Dellawar’s relatives in Afghanistan.

They tell the media that they respect human rights and women’s rights but in reality they’re so barbaric.”

Hasib Dellawar recounts the events of August 15 when he fled from Afghanistan with his family.

The situation in Afghanistan that we’re listening to is starkly different from the place we’re conducting the interview — a cozy two-bedroom apartment in the quiet suburb of Alexandria Virginia.

Thanks to his role working side by side with NATO and American forces as an interpreter and translator Dellawar received a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) last year. With the collapse of the Afghan government his life was in immediate jeopardy as anyone who helped the coalition troops became a primary target of the Taliban. Dellawar his wife and their three children were lucky enough to board a civilian aircraft in Kabul on August 15 — the very day that Hamid Karzai Airport fell to the new regime. He recounts his harrowing journey anxious and unsure whether the plane would take off as the Taliban closed in.

Since moving to Virginia he and his family can finally breathe a sigh of relief but Dellawar is very much worried about those he left behind.

“I’m concerned about my father because he used to be an employee of the former Afghan government” he says showing us a picture of his father and his grandchildren. Restrictions on the SIV meant that Dellawar was unable to bring more family members with him. He says friends and former colleagues frequently text him about having to flee their homes because the Taliban has been knocking door to door to find them.

A new set of challenges

It’s been two months since Dellawar’s family has resettled in Alexandria. Although they no longer fear the Taliban they face a new set of challenges navigating life in a different country.

Dellawar says even mundane tasks like going to the bank are difficult because most appointments have to be made online. He doesn’t have a car or a driver’s license so he has to walk at least six miles a day to take his kids to and from school. He’s also concerned about being able to pay the rent — the housing assistance he receives from community organizations may run out in a few months. He collects around $900 a month in food stamps to feed his family of five but he’s yet to receive cash assistance from the US government. While grateful for the help Dellawar says he wants to find a job as soon as possible to stand on his own two feet and support his family.

“Our brothers and sisiters”

Although the Dellawars came to the US with nothing more than the clothes on their backs their home is fully furnished thanks to the help of people like Amy Marden.

Marden was formerly a volunteer at a community organization that works with the US government to help Afghan families resettle in America. But she soon realized that many nonprofits were overwhelmed. That led her to launch Resettlement Action DC (REACT DC) a nonprofit that provides comprehensive services for Afghan refugees in the Washington area. Along with personally collecting and delivering donated furniture and household items to Dellawar she also helped him enroll his children in school.

As a military spouse Marden felt a strong calling to assist Afghans who served alongside US forces.

“We consider them our brothers and sisters” she says. “They helped us with the war effort and they were our close allies and now they need our help. I think we feel that it’s our duty to be there for them.”

Amy Marden founder of the nonprofit REACT DC moves furniture into the home of an Afghan family.

Marden has already helped about 20 families feel more at home in America but that’s just a tiny fraction of those in need. According to the Biden administration only 3% of the 60000 Afghan refugees in the US that have been fully processed are SIV holders. She says REACT DC’s next goal is to support non-SIV-holding Afghans residing at US military bases as they aren’t eligible to receive most benefits once they leave the facility.

Asking the world for help

When asked about the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan Dellawar says the hurried pullout was wrong.

“It was a big mistake that the US government made to suddenly pull forces without bringing reconciliation among these rivals” he says.

He adds that the US should have allowed a temporary government to come together. “There were 20 years of hard work and achievements but now immediately everything has changed.”

Dellawar laments that he can’t do more for his country but he says he’ll continue to raise his voice through the help of the media. He asks us not to forget about the people of Afghanistan. And he calls on the US government the UN and the rest of the international community to take action especially when it comes to protecting human rights.

“I’m asking the world to do something. We don’t have to sit still and watch what’s going on.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9wdXJwbGxlLXBsYW5zLXRvLWdvLWZvci1pcG8taW4tYWJvdXQtNC15ZWFycy1mcm9tLW5vdy0xMTYzNTY4MjAwMzUwNC5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9uZXdzL3B1cnBsbGUtcGxhbnMtdG8tZ28tZm9yLWlwby1pbi1hYm91dC00LXllYXJzLWZyb20tbm93L2FtcC0xMTYzNTY4MjAwMzUwNC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Purplle plans to go for IPO in about 4 years from now | Mint,"E-commerce firm Purplle which deals in beauty and personal care products is planning to go for an initial public offering (IPO) in 3-4 years after scaling up business with a target growth of around 80 per cent year-on-year a top official of the company said.

The announcement from the company follows after its competitor Nykaa got listed last week.

""Beauty is a business of momentum. As you build momentum and get to a larger scale your cost becomes smaller and you become a profitable franchise. It's not the right time for us to continuously look at our costs.

""Right time for us is to continue to build momentum keep growing at 80 per cent year-on-year. In 3-4 years we will be like a mammoth potentially going for an IPO"" Puplle co-founder and CEO Manish Taneja told PTI.

The company on Friday had announced the raising of around USD 75 million (about ₹555 crore) in a funding round led by private equity fund Kedaara at an enterprise valuation of USD 630 million ( ₹4662 crore).

The company will use the fund to grow six-eight times in the next five years through both organic and inorganic businesses.

Taneja said the company is investing in marketing which is a big expenditure on profit and loss but it's get paid from the business.

He said the company wants to increase its share in about USD 20-billion Indian beauty market.

""We are probably operating at USD 150 million of GMV (gross merchandise value). We will love to strengthen our market share before we enter any other market.

""We don't understand anything outside of India as now. Our core focus over the next 3-4 years will be to build massive leadership in India"" Taneja said.

The company will continue to invest in technology and launch products that are backed by data.

Taneja said data scientist in the company tells the kind of product that the company should launch and the product manager then works on the touch and feel of the product.

Purplle's competitor Nykaa launched an IPO comprising a fresh issue of equity shares worth ₹630 crore and an offer-for-sale (OFS) of 41972660 equity shares by the promoter and existing shareholders.

The initial share-sale of FSN E-Commerce Ventures was fully subscribed on the first day of subscription on Thursday and was subscribed 4.82 times on Day 2 of the offer.

The upper price band of ₹1125 per share values Nykaa at USD 7.4 billion.

According to the IPO documents of Nykaa the beauty and personal care market in India was sized at around USD 17 billion in 2019 and is projected to cross USD 26 billion in 2025.

This is the amount of time it takes the electric car to reach 60mph. That’s not the end of the smugness though. Not only is there a dim feeling that driving a purely electric car is on some level saving the planet but I can also report that during a week of driving around Andalusia reading headlines about soaring fuel prices my self-satisfaction deepened.

People were literally paying to damage the environment while I silently whizzed around the region starting in Malaga then heading west hugging the coast as far as Cadiz before cutting up to Seville and finally slicing through the Serrania de Ronda all the way back to my starting point.

At first glance Spain may not seem an ideal place to make an electric trip like this. Tesla has just eight of its efficient superchargers in Andalusia. Public charging spots are rare in Spain but this is at least set to change — the government has committed hundreds of millions of euros from its EU pandemic recovery fund to improving charging infrastructure plus much more to kick-starting sales and manufacturing of e-vehicles.

Jamie gets his Tesla recharged JAMIE LAFFERTY

However Andalusia does have an abundance of chargers paid for by some of the hotels lining the coast. The Costa del Sol might have been as altered by tourism as anywhere in Europe but at least it now offers this fringe benefit.

It meant that after nervously driving out of Malaga trying to get used to the car and its equally futuristic app I had to travel only about 50 miles before reaching the Kempinski Bahia just outside Estepona. I hadn’t delved too far into the car’s 290-mile range but the valet still dutifully plugged it in somewhere in the bowels of the vast hotel.

The Tesla app offered pretty much the experience that a baby monitor would. It could remotely tell me that the car was at rest and charging and reassure me of its location — I could essentially see whether it was happy. Additionally the app could tell me the temperature inside the car and give me the option to turn on the air conditioning to cool it before I got in which in this sweltering part of the world was very welcome (it doesn’t sound very eco-friendly admittedly but even a few minutes’ battery time makes a difference). At dinner in the Kempinski’s Spiler Beach Club I watched the Mediterranean lap the golden beach while occasionally making sure that my big electric baby was tucked up safe and sound.

The next morning I continued west. This part of the world is also known as the Costa del Crime owing to the number of crooks who have holed up here over the years. Coincidentally Boris Johnson was also in the region as I passed through holidaying in the middle of Britain’s energy crisis.

Wind turbines in rural Malaga GETTY IMAGES

Such issues felt very distant from inside the Tesla especially when colossal forests of elegant wind turbines hung above me. I let the car’s autopilot take over for a while and considered googling the latest on the progress of solar vehicles.

A beautiful lenticular cloud hanging over the Rock of Gibraltar wasn’t quite enough to make me stop in the British territory although it does have two destination chargers. Instead I pushed on to Tarifa on the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula — Morocco is less than ten miles over the water — and the point at which the Sunshine Coast becomes the Coast of Light (Costa de la Luz). A stiff hot wind sent dozens of kitesurfers into the sky while argumentative dogs and itinerant goats strolled the streets past tapas bars and tour companies. It was easy to imagine idling away days or weeks in a place like that but without any electricity sources for the car I had little option but to continue another 75 miles to reach the Tesla supercharger outside Jerez de la Frontera before doubling back a little to overnight in the romantic old port city of Cadiz.

Was it cost-effective? As I was a guest each hotel recharge was complimentary meaning that every morning I was leaving with the equivalent of a full tank (the Tesla supercharger service costs about £18 for a full top-up — a lot less than I’d have spent on a tank of unleaded petrol). Although I probably saved about £100 on fuel the Tesla cost £170 a day to hire making it as expensive as a high-end sports car. That money does also buy plenty of the aforementioned smugness but there’s no denying that it is a more expensive way to approach a road trip.

Seville came next and here more than anywhere else the Tesla’s clever tech came in handy. The baking streets of the ancient Andalusian capital are so tight that the car’s precise collision detectors were in frequent use. The only drawback I found was the lack of sound externally — one man wearing earphones didn’t hear me coming along a cobbled street and stepped out in front of me. Realising how close he’d come to being mown down he apologised made the sign of the cross three times and looked up to the sky.

The spectacular 18th-century Palacio de Villapanes has a charger albeit one that was only recently installed. “It’s not been super-popular so far” the hotel director Martina Cam said. “But we’re hoping it will help to attract people doing a journey like yours.”

I handed over the key card and took a seat in the hotel’s Los Rincones del Marques restaurant. Checking again I got some horrible news — the car was being taken on what looked like a joy ride. I was receiving warnings about its speed (which is electronically limited to 87mph). Out of spite I remotely turned off the car’s air conditioning and music and was about to complain to management when I realised that a second Tesla had been logged on to the temporary account issued to me. I swiped and saw that my car was where it should be — close by calm having its energy gently restored.

I finished my journey driving cross-country via the scenic mountaintop city of Ronda home to another two destination chargers. The rolling landscape looked impossibly parched with gnarled olive trees among few plants able to eke out an existence. It was tempting to find another showpiece hotel in which to spend my final night something as unabashedly ostentatious as the Palacio but in Torremolinos I instead stayed at the humble Costa del Sol Hotel which was just £50 for the night but nonetheless had a charger of its own.

When I returned the car in Malaga the next day I couldn’t quite bring myself to delete the app. Just as I boarded my flight home my phone buzzed. It was a final message from the Tesla — it was topped up and ready to go again. My batteries felt recharged too.

Hertz Interim CEO Mark Fields spoke with Morning Brew about the company's latest electric vehicle purchase.

The once-bankrupt car rental company announced on Monday it bought 100000 Teslas for $4.2 billion.

""Electric vehicles are now mainstream and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest"" Fields said.

Hertz Interim CEO Mark Fields is shedding light on why the once-bankrupt car rental agency has decided to enter the world of electric vehicles.

The company announced it placed a $4.2 billion order for 100000 Teslas on Monday in what Bloomberg reported was the largest ever single purchase of electric vehicles. According to Fields the record-breaking move was spurred in part by ""a combination of data and also mindset"" he told Morning Brew in an interview on Thursday.

""When you look over the next 12 to 36 months I think there's gonna be about 100 EV models coming into the marketplace"" Fields told Morning Brew. ""So you have this combination of customer intent or predisposition rising and you have the products coming.""

Fields said he decided to specifically purchase Teslas because of their scale of production though noted that Hertz eventually wants to work with all EV automakers ""and have strategic discussions with them instead of just tactical ones"" he told Morning Brew.

According to a press release the Teslas will be available in the US and Europe within the next 14 months. As part of the deal Hertz will provide 50000 of the cars to Uber drivers so more people can experience riding in a Tesla. Tesla stock rose 4.3% in pre-market trading following the announcement.

""Electric vehicles are now mainstream and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest"" Fields said in the release. ""The new Hertz is going to lead the way as a mobility company starting with the largest EV rental fleet in North America and a commitment to grow our EV fleet and provide the best rental and recharging experience for leisure and business customers around the world.""

While Fields hinted at Hertz eventually comprising his fleet entirely of EVs he told Morning Brew ""it's not something that we're prepared to talk about publicly."" However he did say Hertz is ""committed to doing the right thing for the environment"" and that their plans will ""evolve over time"" when it comes to EVs according to the interview.

Fields said he hopes that wider consumer access will encourage more drivers to purchase electric vehicles telling Morning Brew that studies show once a person drives or rides in an EV they are 3 to 4 times more likely to purchase one.

""That serves dual purposes for us: It helps Tesla (because they're driving Teslas) but more importantly it helps us achieve our overall objective of making sure we accelerate the adoption of EVs and sustainable transportation across the globe"" he said.

Globally there were more than 10 million electric vehicles in operation in 2020 1.75 million of which hailed from the US according to the International Energy Agency's Global EV Data Explorer. The Tesla Model 3 was one of the most popular EVs sold in 2020 with over 95000 purchases according to the sustainability information site Treehugger.

Wallace a Eudora resident in a Grim Reaper-infused black cloak and carrying a sickle weapon brought an absurdly large vaccination needle to a rally outside the Capitol before offering testimony in the statehouse to the Special Committee on Government Overreach and the Impact of COVID-19 Mandates. She was among 80 people who signed up to share thoughts about the nation’s response to COVID-19 President Joe Biden’s executive orders and personal definitions of medical liberty.

“What I personally believe to be true has led me to change jobs pull my children out of public school and devote so much of my time to understanding as deeply as possible what the mandates could mean for our society and for rule of law in the United States of America” she said. “I am fully radicalized if you will against the unholy trifecta of big government big pharma and big media.”

She said it was no longer clear whether Americans could trust politicians to adhere to the U.S. Constitution or the Kansas Constitution. The “unjust” actions of people at different levels of government during the pandemic undermined public confidence in medical and political systems she said.

“If you know these vaccines to be dangerous to the people and our rights it is between you and God what you choose to do now” Wallace told lawmakers. “You will show your loyalty to whomever you serve and it was never going to be another way.”

The special committee was formed by Republican leaders of the Kansas Legislature after the most fervent conservative GOP members began lobbying to force a special session to take up coronavirus bills. Time is running out for the Legislature to organize a special session which could cost $65000 per day. The Legislature convenes for the 2022 regular session in January.

Those offering testimony Friday and Saturday almost universally objected to Biden’s vaccination directive. Many shared distrust in government and lack of hope the Legislature would adequately push back against the federal government on COVID-19 policy.

Biden’s decision to require federal employees government contractors and people working at large companies to be vaccinated has generated criticism from people who don’t want the vaccination and still uncertain whether a medical or religious exemption could apply. Some don’t want their employers to scrutinize their medical history or evaluate their religious beliefs an are willing to be fired for their views.

Action by federal regulators to lower the age of vaccination to five years old sent a shockwave through people testifying before the committee with several suggesting the risk was so great that it amounted to assault or murder.

Political angle

While the legislative committee worked through COVID-19 testimony in three-minute increments on the third floor of the Capitol Kansans for Health Freedom and others in the anti-vaccine movement hoisted homemade posters waved flags and delivered campaign-style speeches at a rally outside.

The guest list included Kris Kobach a Republican in a three-way race for the party’s nomination in 2022 for attorney general in Kansas. He is best known for serving as the state’s secretary of state and for losing recent campaigns for governor and U.S. Senate.

“I’m so excited to see you all here taking a stand getting outdoors and fighting for your constitutional rights” Kobach said. “This is an organic grass roots uprising of the people who say ‘No you can’t do this to us. We are going to say no. We are going to choose. It’s our choice.’ That’s what this is all about.”

Kobach said the federal government didn’t have authority to order any person to be vaccinated and federal agencies couldn’t arbitrarily compel people to abide by health mandates. He indicated many members of the state Legislature didn’t appreciate finer points of law that support a counter offensive against federal government COVID-19 mandates.

“Just because somebody has a little pin on his lapel and is a legislator that does not make him an expert in the constitution” said Kobach who taught at the University of Missouri-Kansas City law school. “For that matter just because President Obama taught a class in constitutional law that didn’t make him an expert either.”

Al Terwelp representing the Libertarian Party of Kansas said the organization was convinced government had no authority to interfere with a person’s bodily autonomy their freedom of movement voluntary commerce or freedom of association. That equated to opposition to vaccine mandates mask orders stimulus packages essential and nonessential businesses and shutting down parts of the economy he said.

“This must be the line in the sand” Terwelp said. “We have seen nothing but government avidity to segregate discriminate violate and punish. We believe the future holds nothing but more danger to our liberty. We believe that the president’s executive order to mandate vaccines is blatantly unconstitutional. Our president is operating on assumed powers. That is an absolute usurpation.”

‘I am offended’

Jeff Geesling who contracted COVID-19 in November 2020 said government officials and their allies pushing vaccination mandates didn’t want to talk about natural immunity. Instead he said a vaccine that he considered unproven was thrust upon Kansans.

“This reminds me of a time earlier in history in the 1930s. A man by the name of Adolf Hitler came into power in Germany. We all know how that turned out” Geesling said. “The current state of our country is reminding me of how things started there. If we aren’t careful we will end up like Nazi Germany and then wonder how we got there. Now is the time to take a stand and take our country back.”

A similar sentiment was shared by Augusta resident Bryan Luedeke a Textron aviation employee who applied for a religious exemption to avoid a COVID-19 vaccination. He said the accommodation policy would require that he wear a mask consent to daily screening and maintain physical distancing on company property.

“These requirements are representative and reminiscent of Nazi Germany and the mandate for Jews to identify themselves with an arm band” Luedeke said.

On Friday Rep. Brenda Landwehr a Wichita Republican on the special committee responded to testimony by stating she believed people who disagreed with vaccination mandates had to endure modern-day persecution and compared that experience to the Holocaust.

Sheila Sonnenschein who testified after Geesling and Luedeke said she was alarmed that anyone would draw a comparison between wearing a face covering or receiving a vaccine injection to the World War II genocide of European Jews. During the war the Nazis and their collaborators murdered an estimated six million Jews in German-occupied Europe.

“I am offended as a Jewish person” said Sonnelschein who believes vaccinations save lives. “It is so upsetting to hear people compare having a vaccination mandate and a mask mandate to the Holocaust. In the Holocaust people were murdered.”

Militia is ready

Cody Foster a journeyman lineman at Evergy and a firefighter with the Inman Volunteer Fire Department said that during the pandemic he strapped on his boots and went to work every day to keep lights on and his community safe. He said the federal government’s latest response to the ongoing pandemic meant he could be discarded in December because he was “dirty unvaccinated and dangerous.”

“I’m calling on this committee our representatives and our governor to stop this tyranny” Foster said. “We need you to stand behind us and pass legislation to block this infringement of personal freedom. If we allow it to continue there will be no stopping further government overreach.”

Devin Vrana a chiropractor who brought two of her children to the committee hearing said she was against COVID-19 requirements and asked lawmakers to stand up for constituents weary of being “lied to and forced against their will to comply with mandates and government overreach.”

“We can look around the nation and see government leaders using their voice and platform to uphold the Constitution and hold the line for all their people” said Vrana of Goddard. “We can see the Florida and South Dakota and Montana and South Carolina statements and policies being made to protect medical freedom. So we know it is possible here in Kansas.”

House and Senate members in Kansas have a duty to push back against federal mandates that conflict with constitutional principles Jay Atkin told the legislative committee.

He said neighborhood militias of Kansas would be prepared to stop federal forces sent to enforce a vaccination mandate.

“To attempt to force Americans to submit or lose their livelihood — life liberty and property — is to invite violent retribution and resistance” Atkin said. “Violating the very principles on which this republic is founded the instigators are committing treason acting tyrannical and will reap the rewards of their choices.”

‘Land of the sheep’

Shawnee resident Joann Atchity said she’d understood COVID-19 from the beginning of the “so-called” pandemic in 2020 as a mechanism to assume greater control of Americans and the world.

“In retrospect” she said “it is easy to see the decades of planning and preparation that has gone into this operation. We have been systematically conditioned and propagandized to willingly hand over our freedoms. We have been poisoned by fluoride in our water and glyphosate in our food. We have become progressively more and more wards of a ‘nanny’ state.”

Atchity who was denied entry to Shawnee city and school board meetings for not wearing a mask said fear of the coronavirus had been weaponized because frightened people struggled to “think critically and are easy to manipulate and control.”

“The land of the free and the home of the brave has become the land of the sheep and the home of the afraid” she said. “Our elected representatives have sold us out. State and local governments and school boards have been told to follow orders or lose funding and possibly their jobs.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples were obtained from patients with active TB and from healthy volunteers. The study was approved by the University of Cologne Ethics Committee (18-079). Patients as well as healthy volunteers participated after giving written informed consent.

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional state and federal guidelines (approved by the Landesamt fuer Natur Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (LANUV) North Rhine-Westphalia Germany) and the Schleswig-Holstein Ministry of Energy Agriculture the Environment Nature and Digitalization Germany). GsdmdD276A mice were generated by electroporation of C57BL/6N zygotes with 4 μM SpCas9 protein (IDT #1074181) 4 μM gRNA (5′-CCAGATGGGATTGATGAGGA-3′ IDT) and 10 μM template DNA (5′-TCTGCTCCCTGGATCTACCCGCTCCTAACTCCAGTTCCCCAAGACCTCACAGGCTGCCTGCCCTCTGTCCCTCCAGCTGGCATCGATGAGGAGGAATTAATTGAGGCGGCAGACTTCCAGGGCCTGTTGCTGAGGTGAAGGCTTGCTCC-3 IDT). Ear cuts were genotyped by TaqI restriction digest of the PCR product (5′-ACAAAACAGCTCTTCCCCTT-3′ and 5′-ATTTTACAGGACCAGCCCA-3′). Founders carrying the intended D276A mutation were backcrossed once to a C57BL/6N genetic background. All mice studies were performed after approval by local government authorities (LANUV NRW Germany) in accordance with the German animal protection law. Animals were housed in the animal care facility of the University of Cologne under standard pathogen-free conditions with a 12-h light/dark schedule and provided with food and water ad libitum [50]. ASC and caspase-1 knockout mice were recently described [50].

Small molecules used in this study

Rifampicin was purchased from AppliChem (Darmstadt Germany). CHIR99021 dimethyl sulfoxide MCC950 MitoTEMPO Pifithrin-α and VX-765 were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt Germany). CsA was obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor USA). BTP15 was synthetized as described recently [38].

Isolation of human macrophages

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from human blood after ficoll gradient separation (GE Healthcare) and CD14+ cells were isolated using CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec Bergisch Gladbach Germany). Cell numbers were determined using a Neubauer chamber by Trypan blue staining and cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well in 96-well plates (Corning). Monocytes were differentiated into macrophage for 4 days in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 50 ng/ml human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; Miltenyi Biotec). The growth medium was changed to RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS prior to infection. Macrophages were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 .

Isolation of mouse macrophages

BMDMs were isolated from mice. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the legs were removed and dissected from adherent tissue. Femurs and tibia were cut off at both ends and the bone marrow was expelled using a 27 g needle. After centrifugation (10 min 400 × g) cells were plated in petri dishes and incubated in RPMI 1640 (Merck) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biowest Nuaillé France) 10 mM HEPES (Merck) 10 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Merck) 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Merck) 2mM L-glutamine (Merck) and 15% M-CSF (supernatants of L929 mouse fibroblasts) for 7 days at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . After 5 days fresh medium was added. Cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells per well in 96-well plates. Mouse macrophages were either infected with Mtb as indicated in the figure legends or stimulated with LPS (5 µg/ml 4 h at room temperature (RT); Sigma) and/or Nigericin (5 µM 2 h at RT Sigma).

Cell culture

THP-1 macrophages (ATCC Manassas USA) were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS. MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts (Coriell Institute for Medical Research) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% sodium pyruvate. J774.2 macrophages (Merck) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% FBS. All cell lines were tested routinely for mycoplasma contamination.

Culture conditions of bacteria

The mycobacterial strain Erdman (provided by S.T. Cole Institute Pasteur Paris) was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 10% albumin dextrose catalase 0.05% Tween-80 and 0.2% glycerol.

Survival assays

For the survival assays macrophages were seeded in 96-well plates and preincubated with different compounds for 2 h. Primary human macrophages (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 or 2) and mouse BMDMs (MOI 3) were infected with Mtb Erdman in RPMI medium for 48 h. Afterwards the cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Survival was assessed using 4’6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Thermo Fisher Scientific) staining. Images were acquired on an IX81 inverted microscope (Olympus Hamburg Germany) using the cellSens standard software (Olympus) and Fiji processing software to count the number of surviving cells which was used to calculate cell survival.

TMRM staining

Primary human macrophages mouse BMDMs and THP-1 wild-type and knock-out cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and infected with Mtb Erdman for up to 24 h at an MOI of 1 2 and 3 respectively. For staining with TMRM cells were washed several times with PBS before adding TMRM at a final concentration of 100 nM (Merck). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 for 20 min and washed with PBS. Images were acquired on an IX81 inverted microscope using the cellSens software.

SYTOX Green staining

Primary human macrophages were seeded in a 96-well plate and infected with Mtb Erdman for up to 24 h at an MOI of 1. For staining with SYTOX Green cells were washed several times with PBS and stained with SYTOX Green at a final concentration of 100 nM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 for 20 min and washed with PBS. Images were acquired on an IX81 inverted microscope using the cellSens software. Sytox-positive cells were counted to determine cell survival as indicated in the figure.

Immunofluorescence staining

Primary human macrophages were seeded on 8-well chamber slides and infected with Mtb Erdman for 5 h at an MOI of 2. For GSDMD staining cells were washed with PBS and stained with MitoTracker™ Red CMXRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at RT washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. After three washes in PBS cells were incubated with blocking solution (5% FBS 0.1% Triton X-100 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h at RT followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibody (anti-GSDMD HPA044487 from Merck; RRID: AB_2678957). After three washes in PBS cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (4421 Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at RT. Finally slides were mounted (ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant) and images were acquired using a Olympus Fluoview FV 1000 confocal microscope with ×60 objective. Magnification microscope settings and laser intensity were maintained equal for the different experimental conditions.

Isolation of mitochondria

Mitochondria were isolated from 2 × 107 primary human macrophages infected with Mtb Erdman (MOI 2) for 5 h using the Mitochondria Isolation Kit for Cultured Cells according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In detail we used the reagent-based methods described in the manufacturer’s manual. The mitochondria pellet was lysed with 2% CHAPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mM Tris 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2) containing Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 min by vortexing. Upon centrifugation supernatants were harvested and the protein concentration was measured with the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and mitochondrial lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis.

Immunoblot analysis

THP-1 monocytes were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 4.5 × 106 per well and incubated with 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 72 h. Afterwards the medium was changed to RPMI/FBS without PMA for 24 h. The cells were infected with Mtb Erdman at an MOI of 2 and supernatants were collected 24 h post infection. The supernatants were precipitated using methanol and chloroform and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis as previously described. The following antibodies were used: anti-ANT2 (14671; RRID: AB_2798562) anti-β-actin (4970) anti-cleaved IL-1β (83186; RRID: AB_2800010) and anti-NLRP3 (15101; RRID: AB_2722591) from Cell Signaling Technology and anti-GSDMD (HPA044487; RRID: AB_2678957) from Merck.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

IL-1β and IL-18 ELISA (BioLegend San Diego USA) were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. BMDMs primary macrophages and THP-1 cells were used for this assay and infected as described before. For ESX-1 inhibition assay 2.5 × 106 THP-1 GSDMD knock-out cells were seeded per well infected with an MOI of 1. Five hours post infection BTP-15 (10 µM) was added to the cells for additional 24 h. Lysates and supernatants were taken as described before 5 h and in total 29 h post infection. Briefly supernatant obtained from human macrophage and THP-1 cells was diluted 1:10 and supernatant from BMDMs was diluted 1:2 in the ELISA Kit diluent and incubated for 2 h. All samples were measured in technical duplicates and the concentration was determined with the corresponding standard curve. The optical density was measured in a Hidex Sense microplate reader (Hidex Turku Finland) and the data were analyzed with the GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 software (GraphPad San Diego CA USA).

Proteomics

Whole-cell lysates were gained from uninfected and Mtb-infected J774.2 macrophages (MOI 5) 24 h post infection. The protein concentration was determined by the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit and 50 µg protein was precipitated using ice-cold acetone. Chromatin degradation was achieved in a Bioruptor (10 min cycle 30/30 s) in 8 M urea buffer in 50 mM triethylammoniumbicarbonate (TEAB). Digestion was carried out via an in-solution digest. Briefly proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h at 25 °C and alkylated with 40 mM chloroacetamide for 30 min at RT in the dark. Lys-C was added at a 1-to-75 enzyme-to-substrate ratio for pre-digestion for 4 h at 25 °C. Afterwards 50 mM TEAB was used to achieve a urea concentration of 2 M for digestion with 1 µg/µl trypsin. Samples were incubated overnight and digestion was stopped by acidification with 1% formic acid. Finally the samples were primed by STAGE tip technique and analyzed by mass spectrometry using data-independent acquisition. Mass spectrometry and data analysis were conducted by Dr. Stefan Müller at the Proteomics Core Facility Cologne.

Quantification of ROS

MRC-5 fibroblasts were seeded in black 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well and infected with Mtb Erdman at an MOI of 10. Mitochondrial ROS production was analyzed by MitoSOX Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 24 h post infection. The cells were washed with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and incubated with MitoSOX Red (5 μM in HBSS) at 37 °C for 15 min. Following incubation cells were washed three times with HBSS and fluorescence was detected in a BioTek Cytation™ 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (Bad Friedrichshall Germany). The cell-specific fluorescence was calculated by subtracting the fluorescence of cell-free wells containing HBSS.

Quantification of calcium

Intracellular calcium concentration was determined using the Fluo-4 NW Calcium Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly J774.2 macrophages were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well in black-walled 96-well plates and infected with Mtb Erdman at an MOI of 5 for up to 24 h. Cells were washed with HBSS and incubated with Fluo-4 NW for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluo-4 NW (excitation wavelength/emission wavelength: 488 nm/530 nm) was detected using a BioTek Cytation™ 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader. Calcium was quantified by calculating the ratio of the ion-bound (excitation wavelengths 340 nm) and ion-free indicators (excitation wavelengths 380 nm).

Mtb infection of mice

IL-13-overexpressing (tg) mice on a BALB/c genetic background [34] and BALB/c heterozygous littermates were bred under specific-pathogen-free conditions in the animal facilities of the Research Center Borstel. For infection experiments age- and sex-matched animals were transferred to the BSL3 facility and kept in individually ventilated cages. Mice were infected with an aerosol containing the Mtb strain H37Rv using an inhalation exposure system (Glas-Col Terre-Haute IN USA) as described [34]. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act and approved by the Ministry of Energy Agriculture the Environment Nature and Digitalization Kiel Germany (approval number 33-05/04).

Immunohistochemistry of the lungs

Lungs were fixed in 4% buffered formalin embedded in paraffin and sectioned on a microtome. To examine histopathological changes during infection sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR

Before and at various time points of infection pieces of lungs were weighed and homogenized in 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate buffer. After acid phenol extraction RNA was transcribed into cDNA and qPCR was performed using a light cycler (Roche Diagnostics Corporation Indianapolis IN USA). The following primer and probe sets were employed. Hprt: sense 5′-TCC TCC TCA GAC CGC TTT T-3′ antisense 5′-CCT GGT TCA TCA TCG CTA ATC-3′ probe 5′-AGT CCA G-3′; Nlrp3: sense 5′- -3′ antisense 5′- -3′ probe 5′- -3′.

Generation of THP-1 knock-out cells

All THP-1 lines were cultured as previously described. In all 1 × 106 THP-1 cells were spin infected (800 rpm 2 h 37 °C) twice with third-generation Lentiviral Cas9-EGFP (ThermoFisher) particles (MOI 5) and eGFPhigh-expressing single-cell clones were selected by eGFP-mediated fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Lentiviral particles containing guide RNA were purchased from ThermoFisher and used according to the manufacturer’s procedure (four separate guide RNA constructs were used for each knock-out). In all 106 THP-1 Cas9-GFP cells were transduced with lentiviral particles (each guide separate and in combination MOI 5). Spin-infection was performed at 800 rpm for 2 h. Centrifuge was heated during that time to 37 °C and media was supplemented with 20 mM Hepes (ThermoFisher). Twenty-four hours post infection media was replenished and cells were cultured in media as described. Selection was performed by addition of puromycin (Roth) into the culture media. Specific gene knock-out was validated via immunoblotting.

Statistical analysis

Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The data were analyzed with the Graphpad Prism version 8.0.2 software program. Mann–Whitney U-Test was used to compare two matched groups and the one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-tests was used to compare more than two groups and differences with p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. No data were excluded from the analysis of experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I call it a remembrance because an anniversary seems to me to be something that is a happy joyful occasion.

This was not a happy day some three years ago.

Literally hundreds of thousands of lives were changed that day.

Now that’s an easy number to get to not just the 26000 or so Paradise residents who had to drive through fire that day but also those who lived in Butte Creek Canyon Magalia and Concow.

But when you think of all of the lives that those who fled the fire that day have impacted since it’s pretty easy to get to hundreds of thousands of people who were affected by that fire that day.

It’s scattered Paradise residents throughout the United States following Nov. 8 2018 — and you cannot blame those folks for making the decision to relocate elsewhere — whether it is by choice or due to a lack of options.

But there are those who remain and they are committed to rebuilding Paradise.

On Thursday another sign of a rebuilding Paradise was on full display.

That was with the return of Grocery Outlet to Paradise.

The Grocery Outlet had been located in the Safeway shopping center that was on Clark Road.

That shopping center looked like it was one of the remnants of a World War II-style bombing on Nov. 9.

Everything seemingly was gone.

But on Thursday one of the stores that had been housed in that shopping center opened where the old Rite Aid used to be next to Mehoos Restaurant on Skyway.

Much like Save Mart on Clark Road and Holiday Market which is about a couple of Braden Gonzales touchdown throws away from the new Grocery Outlet the new store offers not just Paradise residents another place to shop but also those who live in Magalia.

What the opening of that store means is that much like the other stores have opened on the ridge Grocery Outlet is banking on the continued growth of the Paradise marketplace.

That’s no different than the same bet that Tractor Supply made when it opened its store on Clark Road.

About a year ago Councilor Greg Bolin mentioned that those business rooftops would begin to return to Paradise as the housing rooftops began to pop up.

And despite a coronavirus shut down that slowed down much of the country’s ability to produce things that rebuild has been now frustrated by a supply chain issue.

And while it’s fair to say the rebuild has been frustrated it has not been stopped. It has continued to move forward despite that frustration.

And because it has those business rooftops are coming back to Paradise.

They will be coming back to a town that is in the middle of constructing a walkable downtown that won’t be smack dab in the middle of the main thoroughfare from Chico to Magalia.

Oh to be sure there will be businesses that will remain along the Skyway but there will also be a new business hub in an area that can allow for a nice downtown feel.

There is an important thing to understand governments don’t make money they spend money and to get that money it needs a strong free-market base to work from. Related Articles Opinion | More than a banquet — it’s (still) about community | Editor’s notes

And on Thursday Paradise opened another business that will employ residents and those who live in the valley who may want to come back to the ridge someday.

But it also creates another sales tax-generating business for the town.

These are important developments because as those sales tax-generating businesses return to Paradise along with their employees the town inches closer to a successful rebuild.

Now everybody has to understand that this will be a long process what that fire destroyed in one day may take a decade or so to rebuild.

But if there’s anything you should know about Paradise is that it’s a community has always had a can-do attitude separate and apart from what the government structure has in place.

And when you looked at the people that were there for the Grocery Outlet opening amongst the smiles and joy of another business returning to the ridge was a silent but obvious determination that Paradise will rebuild from that Camp Fire.

Everyone there on Thursday knew it they shared it but they never had to say it. It was obvious.

And why wouldn’t it? What else would you expect from crazy mountain folk?",,,,,,,,,,,,

However not all Dogecoin clones are equal. Shiba Inu’s success is partly down to its developing ecosystem including a DEX NFTs staking and supporting tokens in $LEASH and $BONE which are live and operational right now.

With Floki Inu lacking similar functionality are the people behind it wasting their advertising spend?

Is Floki Inu the next Dogecoin?

Dogecoin’s monumental rise earlier this year saw it post +15000% gains in the five months to May. For that reason it’s understandable that people are looking to copy the original.

At present there’s no shortage of doggy-themed tokens being launched including the newest kid on the block FlokiGravity up 290000% today. Or Baby Floki Billionaire which is relatively more established having started on Binance Smart Chain on October 3 making a 1300% run-up from launch to its all-time high on Saturday.

Rightly or wrongly as eluded to above a significant aspect of their appeal is the millionaire-making potential they are seen to have.

Keen to cash in the team behind Floki posted a tweet on October 6 promoting their advertising campaign. It centers around the tagline “Missed Doge? Get Floki.”

“#FLOKI now live in London Underground! This is indicative of our plan to make the $FLOKI brand one of the most familiar brands in London and the UK! FLOKI ads will also be going live on 300 buses in London soon!”

London public transport users hit by an advertising “assault”

Having spoken to the marketing team the FT says the campaign aims to legitimize Floki Inu in the general public’s eyes.

A representative by the pseudo name “Sabre” said they are looking to inspire confidence in the brand. He/she feels it’s necessary to separate Floki Inu from the many scam projects that exist in the cryptoverse.

“These advertising campaigns will run together and will be a full out assault of the London public transportation system.”

Similar advertising campaigns are set for rollout in Los Angeles and Japan China and Russia.

While Sabre said the current campaign is looking at instilling trust in the brand the FT noted that questions on who is behind Floki Inu remain unanswered.

“Floki Inu did not respond to a Financial Times request for comment on which individuals or corporate entities are in control of the project.”

Pangea moves in on November 1 and will work alongside Check2Fly for three weeks at Terminal 1. Then on November 21 Check2Fly will cease to operate at the airport and instead open up a testing complex nearby.

Check2Fly which is co-operated by Omega and Rambam Health Care Campus is being ousted from providing tests for outgoing passengers after a months-long legal battle that began when the companies won a tender from the Israel Airports Authority to provide testing for both departing and arriving travelers.

Pangea the company that came in second had appealed to the court saying that Omega did not meet the criteria of the Airports Authority’s tender.

Because of Pangea’s appeal the court gave the tender back to the Airports Authority. First the authority canceled its tender for incoming passengers and turned it over to the Health Ministry which on June 15 ousted Check2Fly and replaced it with Test & Go operated by Femi Premium.

In addition the authority offered Pangea to take over for Omega for outgoing passengers which led to an additional legal battle that only recently was completed.

Omega was the cheapest company and hence was first selected by the airport.

For a test that takes 14 hours from screening to results the price has been NIS 40. For a test that takes only four hours it has been NIS 120.

Now prices are going to rise Globes reported to NIS 89 for a slower test and to NIS 149 for a rapid test.

As Check2Fly leaves the airport it will expand further across the country including recently opening up a new testing station at the Azrieli Mall and one at Dizengoff Center Mall in Tel Aviv beginning on November 3. The mall complexes will operate six days per week. Rapid tests will cost NIS 135.

Moreover new complexes are expected on Habarzel Street in Tel Aviv and at Ramat Hachayal with plans to expand further in the coming weeks and months.

“I have no doubt that... opening more positions will make it easier for people coming and going from Israel and will provide the best and highest quality service for the benefit of maintaining national health security” said Omega CEO Lily Nankin.

The company said its tests will continue to meet all requirements for travelers wishing to test before flying abroad.

Not all travelers are required to take a test to board an airplane abroad; that depends on the rules of the country to which an individual is flying. However all incoming travelers to Israel are required to take a test within 72 hours of arrival in the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMzQ1Mjc0L3JhYmF0LXNhbGUtdHJhbS10by1yZXN1bWUtc2VydmljZS10by1oYXNzYW4taWktYWwtYWxhb3V5aW5lLXN0b3Bz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rabat-Sale Tram to Resume Service to Hassan II-Al Alaouyine Stops,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.

Luis Garcia. Jerry Garcia. Get it?

Then after getting a glimpse of the rookie pitcher’s unique wind-up against the hometown Atlanta Braves Kaminski was suddenly stricken with a bit of inspiration.

“Listen to this” he said flashing a mischievous grin his hands stirring eagerly on the keyboard.

As the Astros’ Garcia strolled to the plate in Game 3 Kaminski broke into a playful version of “Rock-A-Bye-Baby” — the perfect musical accompaniment for a rookie right-hander whose extended wind-up has been compared to someone rocking a child.

“I came up with that on the spot” Kaminski would explain later providing a quick primer on his quirky process for working out the melody to songs at a moment’s notice. “There are times when I get to play a song for the first time in front of 40000 people.”

There are plenty of stars at this World Series from Freddie Freeman to Jose Altuve but let’s give a shout-out to the bespectacled 44-year-old jazz lover sitting behind the Hammond SK2 organ at Truist Park.

He has no ambitions of being a star — “when someone goes into jazz they’re not thinking of becoming famous” — but Kaminski has pulled off an impressive musical feat.

He’s made the organ cool again.

Kaminski’s eclectic taste in music and his witty selections when opposing players come to the plate have made him a bit of a cult figure around the suburban Atlanta ballpark.

Even Braves players pay attention to the songs Kaminski is playing for the other guys.

“I do notice it” outfielder Adam Duvall said. “This guy is unique.”

A devoted band of social media followers eagerly await Kaminski revealing his planned selections on social media when a new team is coming to town though all picks are subject to change.

Luis Garcia for instance was initially supposed to get the Jerry Garcia-penned Dead song “Casey Jones” but that idea was scuttled in favor of the song that every sleepless parent knows by heart.

Guessing why Kaminski picks a song has become a game within the game with everyone from more than 22000 Twitter followers ( @bravesorganist ) to the visiting media weighing in on the connection between player and tune.

Given Kaminski’s extensive repertoire — he has a master’s degree in music from Georgia State University and loves everything from 1960s Beach Boys to timeless polka ditties — that is often a tall task.

“I choose songs that I think work best on the instrument” he explained. “Some songs just don’t work that well on the organ.”

Kaminski can’t to go too deep into his catalogue — the guessing game doesn’t really work if no one has ANY idea what he’s playing — but he clearly enjoys the perplexed looks when someone tries to figure out why let’s say he’s playing the “M(asterisk)A(asterisk)SH” theme for Astros slugger Carlos Correa.

“His name is Correa. Which sounds like Korea. ‘M(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H’ was based in Korea” Kaminski said.

He’s not afraid to push a few buttons either though he’s always quick to point out that it’s all in good fun.

When Altuve led off Game 3 Kaminski regaled him with the nursery rhyme “I’m a little teapot short and stout.” Altuve is one of baseball’s shortest players at 5-foot-6.

“It’s just a kids’ song” Kaminski said. “To me that’s not mean-spirited. That’s about having home-field advantage.”

In fact most visiting players seem to recognize that’s all in good fun.

Kaminski still remembers the reaction of now-retired outfielder Jayson Werth who grew out his hair and sported an enormous Grizzly Adams-like beard.

Or to Kaminski’s eyes and then to his ears a more biblical figure.

“He kind of resembled Jesus” Kaminski recalled. “So I played a lot of ‘Jesus Is Just Alright’ for him.”

Werth was clearly listening.

“He would tell (former Braves catcher) Brian McCann that he couldn’t believe I just played that song for him” Kaminski related. “He wasn’t really complaining. He thought it was funny.”

And now a quick musical quiz.

Here are some of the other songs Kaminski played for Houston’s players during the World Series. See if you can figure out the connection. (Answers will be provided later promise.)

— Michael Brantley. “Takin’ It to the Streets.”

— Yordan Álvarez. “River of Jordan.”

— Kyle Tucker. “Can’t You See” and “Delta Dawn.”

— Yuli Gurriel. “Girl You’ll Be a Woman Soon.”

— Martin Maldonado. “That’s Amore.”

— Another Correa song: “Spain.”

Bonus points for this one:

— Alex Bregman. “I Am The Walrus.”

Kaminski became the Braves’ organist in 2009 landing the job through the friend of a friend. He’s now performed at more than 1000 games starting at Turner Field and moving with the team to Truist Park five seasons ago.

Living in suburban Atlanta with his wife Kathleen and their two daughters 11-year-old Allison and 8-year-old Sarah he performs around town in various groups — though the pandemic has cut into his performing schedule — and gives private lessons.

“Everything that encompasses being a musician — teacher performer whatever — that’s me” he said with a chuckle. “It’s all one thing.”

A native of the Chicago suburbs Kaminski moved South along with his parents after initially enrolling at the University of Arizona. He always loved music and was drawn to instruments with keyboards learning to play the organ piano and accordion.

His musical tastes are sprawling — jazz classical salsa rock polka harmonies — but he concedes to one glaring blind spot.

“Popular music of the last 10 years maybe the last 20 years is where my music knowledge is lacking” he said.

That’s where he turns to his wife and kids for guidance.

“They’re teaching me about Dua Lipa and The Weeknd” Kaminski quipped.

While the organ was once a staple at ballparks and sports venues it has become increasingly expendable in a world of changing tastes. Only about half of major league stadiums still employ an organist the others relying exclusively on piped-in music and other off-field shenanigans.

Kaminski takes issue with those who call the organ old-fashioned.

“When I say I’m an organist a lot of people think I just play in a church” he said. “But I think the organ is so hip. If you watch any rock band on TV even country bands there’s still an organist in a lot of bands.

“It’s not out front all the time” he added. “But you’d be surprised. If you listen to the radio listen really closely the organ is there a lot of times. Perhaps I’m doing my little part of make it more popular in sports.”

So are you finished taking the quiz?

Here are the answers:

— Brantley. “Takin’ It to the Streets” was the title track of the first Doobie Brothers album sung by Michael McDonald. He shares a first name with Brantley.

— Alvarez. “River of Jordan” was sung by Peter Paul and Mary but Kaminski was inspired by its hilarious cameo in the epic movie comedy “Airplane!”

— Tucker. “Can’t You See” was a hit for The Marshall Tucker Band while Tanya Tucker sung “Delta Dawn.”

— Gurriel. Kaminski went with “Girl You’ll Be a Woman Soon” because of the similarity between the player’s name and the word “girl.”

— Maldonado. “That’s Amore” was a Dean Martin classic. Last name matches the player’s first name.

— Correa. “Spain” was one of jazz legend Chick Correa’s best-known songs.

Now for the bonus song:

— Bregman. The lyrics to “I Am The Walrus” include the line “I am the egg man” which rhymes (sort of) with Bregman.

“I do feel like I have an opportunity to kind of present this instrument to a wide variety of people” Kaminski said. “Hopefully the exposure I get with the Braves leads to interest in this genre and this instrument.”

Batter up!

The guy at the organ is ready with a song.

Months after calling for a boycott of Major League Baseball Mr. Trump and wife Melania attended the game between the Braves and Houston Astros at Truist Park in Atlanta. They were seen doing a chopping gesture – a Braves' gameday tradition considered offensive to many Native Americans.

President Donald Trump does the Tomahawk Chop while at the World Series in Atlanta. pic.twitter.com/CNmZcLYO8x — David Hookstead (@dhookstead) October 31 2021

Debate over the use of the chop and Braves' name has reemerged nationally as the Braves compete for their first World Series title since 1995. Last week while MLB commissioner Bob Manfred defended them the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) president Fawn Sharp issued a statement in opposition to the continued use of the chop and team name – the latter which was first used by the team in 1912 as a term for Native American warrior.

""In our discussions with the Atlanta Braves we have repeatedly and unequivocally made our position clear – Native people are not mascots and degrading rituals like the 'tomahawk chop' that dehumanize and harm us have no place in American society"" Sharp said.

The Trumps' presence at the World Series also received widespread attention after Mr. Trump encouraged a boycott of MLB games in April following the league's decision to move the 2021 All-Star Game to Coors Field in Denver because of Georgia's new voting restrictions. Mr. Trump told supporters on Saturday that he would be attending with New York Yankees president Randy Levine and thanked the MLB for the invitation. However the MLB denied making the invitation and said in a statement ""He requested to attend the game.""

Mr. Trump was joined by U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker a former NFL running back who received the endorsement of the former commander-in-chief. Walker is looking to unseat freshman Democratic Senator Rafael Warnock of Georgia in 2022.

Former United States President Donald Trump said in a message to his email list that MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and New York Yankees president Randy Levine invited him to attend Game 4 of the World Series between the visiting Houston Astros and host Atlanta Braves on Saturday.

However MLB officials sent an email to Yahoo Sports' Hannah Keyser disputing that claim saying that Trump requested to attend the matchup.

That aligns with remarks made by Atlanta Braves CEO Terry McGuirk to Bob Nightengale of USA Today:

""He called MLB and wanted to come to the game. We were very surprised. Of course we said yes.""

Trump's message to his list read as follows:

""Looking forward to being at the World Series in Atlanta tonight. Thank you to the Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred and Randy Levine of the great New York Yankees for the invite. Melania and I are looking forward to a wonderful evening watching two great teams!""

Trump notably told reporters that he was scheduled to throw out the first pitch at an August 15 2020 Boston Red Sox vs. New York Yankees game.

""Randy Levine's a great friend of mine from the Yankees"" Trump said July 23 2020.

""He asked me to throw out the first pitch. And I think I'm doing that on August 15 at Yankee Stadium. And I say 'How's the crowd going to be?' And it's like: 'You don't have a crowd. There is no such thing.' It's gonna be interesting.""

Trump said three days later that he had to cancel that scheduled first pitch because of his focus on COVID-19.

However Katie Rogers and Noah Weiland of the New York Times reported that Trump had not been invited to throw out the first pitch: ""Mr. Trump had not actually been invited on that day by the Yankees according to one person with knowledge of Mr. Trump's schedule. His announcement surprised both Yankees officials and the White House staff."""
TYL,Tyler Technologies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsd3cybXVzZXVtLm9yZy93YXIvYXJ0aWNsZXMva2VybWl0LXR5bGVyLWNhbGwtd291bGQtbGl2ZS1pbmZhbXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kermit Tyler: A Call That Would Live in Infamy,"Kermit Tyler’s experiences as a fighter pilot in World War II were similar to many other fighter pilots who served in the Pacific theater with one notable exception—on the morning of December 7 1941 he was the officer in charge of the air information center at Fort Shafter on O’ahu who mistook the radar image of an incoming wave of Japanese attack aircraft for a flight of B-17 bombers he expected from the US mainland. Tyler’s response to the radar operator who reported the contact that morning to “don’t worry about it” would be grounds for countless historians military professionals armchair generals and conspiracy theorists over the past eight decades to critique and criticize his actions that day and to argue over whether he could’ve prevented the significant loss of life sustained in the attack or even stopped the attack on Pearl Harbor itself.

Kermit Tyler was born in Fayette County Iowa in 1913 and grew up just outside of Los Angeles California. His interest in flying began when he was a child and was continually fueled by the exhibitions put on by traveling barnstormers throughout the 1920s. At the age of 19 Tyler enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve and during his drill weekends he would help work on planes after the pilots finished their training for the day in the hopes of getting a ride in one of them.

By 1936 Tyler had fulfilled his obligation to the Marine Corps and had completed two years of college. Tyler had always had an interest in aviation so knowing he possessed all he needed to qualify for flight training he dropped out of college and volunteered for the US Army Air Corps Aviation Cadet Program. After being accepted he was sent to San Antonio Texas where he took his primary and basic flight training at Randolph Field and then completed his advanced training at Kelly Field. In 1937 Tyler was awarded his pilot’s wings and received a commission as a second lieutenant in the US Army Air Corps Reserve.

At Kelly Field Tyler had been trained as an observation pilot so after getting his wings he was sent to Moffett Field in Santa Clara County California where he spent the next three years pulling target sleeves and spotting for artillery units. He enjoyed the limited flying he was able to do but wanted more out of his career in military aviation so when the opportunity to train as a pursuit pilot came he accepted it.

In October 1940 Tyler was sent to Hamilton Field in Novato California where he transitioned to flying fighter aircraft. Later Tyler became a member of the 35th Pursuit Group. Since the group had just arrived at Hamilton Field however Tyler was one of only two pilots in the squadron he was assigned to. The other pilot was Clinton “Casey” Vincent a famous personality in Air Force circles. Unfortunately with aviation operations in such a disorganized state at that time Tyler’s future was uncertain and he was not happy at Hamilton Field. Still he loved flying so he toughed out the assignment and waited for something better to come along.

By the spring of 1941 the US Army Air Corps had activated several new pursuit groups. When Tyler learned of one such new outfit in Hawai’i that had slots available for pilots he requested a transfer. His request was approved and in February 1941 Tyler joined the 78th Pursuit Squadron 18th Pursuit Group based at Wheeler Field on O’ahu Territory of Hawai’i. After arriving in Hawai’i he and a squadron-mate named Charles H. “Mac” MacDonald who would end the war as a successful fighter ace with 27 confirmed victories and later retire from the US Air Force with the rank of Colonel rented a house on Kawailoa Beach on O’ahu’s North Shore. There the young aviators lived an “idyllic” life. It was also there that Tyler developed his life-long love of surfing. By the fall of 1941 Tyler had been promoted to First Lieutenant and was serving as the executive officer of the 78th Pursuit Squadron. Life in the islands for Kermit Tyler was good.

In an effort to familiarize pursuit pilots with the new radar systems being installed around the Hawaiian Islands Army Air Forces Major Kenneth P. Bergquist the operations officer for the Hawaiian Interceptor Command arranged to have the various pursuit groups based in Hawai’i send pilots to the information center at Fort Shafter in Honolulu to work shifts with the air information controllers. The job of the controllers was to process and track reports coming into the center from the Signal Aircraft Warning Service radar stations positioned around the islands.

Once a suspected enemy contact had been picked up by radar that contact report would be sent to the information center at Fort Shafter. The center would then plot the contact on a map and send out pursuit aircraft to meet it. The process of locating threats via radar and dispatching aviation assets to meet them were all fairly new in the US military. Servicemembers had to be trained to operate the new technology and perform the necessary tasks associated with them.

Kermit Tyler’s turn to learn this new technology came during the first week of December 1941. At 4:00 a.m. on Wednesday December 3 Tyler arrived for his first four-hour shift in the information center. Officially his job there was to assist the controllers in vectoring pursuit aircraft to meet any identified incoming enemy threats however he was really there to learn about this new process and how it worked. Though he had received a brief orientation in mid-November Tyler received no training before during or after his first shift and nothing of note occurred during that first four hours. Therefore when Tyler showed up to work his second shift at 4:00 a.m. on Sunday December 7 1941 he had no reason to think that morning would be any different. How wrong he was.

Prior to his assignment in the information center Tyler had been told by a friend who served with the bomber forces that when groups of bombers flew to Hawai’i from the US mainland they were guided in by a radio station on O’ahu that would play Hawaiian music non-stop with no interruptions for commercials or news updates. When Tyler drove from his home on O’ahu’s north shore to Fort Shafter on the morning of December 7 he noticed that there were no interruptions to the music. Remembering what his friend told him Tyler expected a flight of bombers to arrive that morning.

At 4:00 a.m. on Sunday December 7 1941 Tyler opened the air information center at Fort Shafter. In the center with him that morning was roughly a half dozen enlisted men. He was the only officer present. The first three hours of that morning’s four-hour shift passed by uneventfully. The radar stations positioned around the islands would all shut down at 7:00 a.m. so the crew in the information center did not expect to receive any calls during the last hour of the shift.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaXRlbWxpdmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMzEvbHlubi10ZWNoLWZvb3RiYWxsLXdyYXBzLXVwLXJlZ3VsYXItc2Vhc29uLXdpdGgtYmxvd291dC13aW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lynn Tech football wraps up regular season with blowout win,"LYNN — The Lynn Tech football team closed out its regular season with a bang Saturday morning knocking off Minuteman Tech by a score of 44-6 at Manning Field. The second quarter proved to be the difference for the Tigers who scored 24 points in the frame to blow the game open before halftime.

Tech quarterback Tyler David rushed for two touchdowns in the victory for the Tigers while Domenic Giordano rushed for one touchdown.

The first quarter belonged to David who made a number of big plays to help put Tech ahead. It started when he punched one in with 7:44 to go in the first to make it 8-0; then he came back with a long run to bring the Tigers inside the Minuteman five-yard line on Tech’s next offensive possession. Two plays later he scored on a four-yard run for his second touchdown of the day.

Minuteman took advantage of a Tech fumble in between scoring drives scooping the ball up and taking it to the house to get on the scoreboard.

But that was the last time Minuteman would see the end zone as the Tech defense clamped down and the offense continued to ramp things up.

The Tigers went on to force a fumble and get a quick score from Giordano to go up 22-6 then back-to-back rapid-fire touchdowns within 37 seconds of each other gave the Tigers a 38-6 lead at the halftime break.

After one more touchdown in the third quarter the Tigers were able to coast to victory in the season finale.

(AP) — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Tyson Foods is moving ahead with plans for a $355 million manufacturing operation that will create 450 full-time jobs in Bowling Green.

The company will build the facility in the Kentucky Transpark for production of Jimmy Dean and Wright Brand bacon. Company leaders anticipate construction will be complete in late 2023.

Kansas News Service

GARDEN CITY — Drivers approaching this cattle city on K-156 highway watch as the scenery changes from a patchwork of southwest Kansas crop fields pastures and feedlots to a collage of suburban sprawl.

The Home Depot stands next to the Dick’s Sporting Goods which shares a parking lot with the Old Navy that just opened this summer.

Across the street one of the town’s two Burger Kings serves up Whoppers in the shadow of the only Target store for a three-hour drive in any direction.

One hundred miles west Russ Baldwin makes a left turn off Main Street into an empty parking lot in Lamar Colorado.

“Behold: the former Burger King” Baldwin said lifting his hand from the steering wheel. “Home of the ex-Whopper.”

Plywood boards cover the drive-thru window. Next door the old K-Mart sits vacant.

Within minutes he drives past the airport that lost its last commercial flight in the early 2000s. Then the factory that used to be the town’s largest employer — until it abruptly shut down 15 years ago.

“That was pretty much the perfect storm” Baldwin said. “You’re sitting there going ‘What’s next a locust invasion?’”

Arrival marks milestone for Garden City

Just a few decades ago the two outposts were basically Kansas and Colorado versions of each other. But in 1980 the world’s largest meatpacking plant opened on the outskirts of Garden City. Almost overnight it became the fastest-growing part of Kansas.

Thousands of new jobs. Billions of dollars in new industry. A boomtown in a region that has lost residents for generations.

The plant’s arrival marked a milestone for Garden City making it the epicenter of the High Plains beef industry. And the city’s decision to open its doors to the thousands of immigrant and refugee workers who would accompany the plant has — at least so far — helped it escape the fate of the many surrounding towns that still see an unending exodus.

What’s more the diverging trajectories of Garden City and Lamar over the past 40-some years offer a glimpse at the knife’s edge between prosperity and decline in rural America.

That’s because the town that Garden City beat out to win the meatpacking plant was Lamar.

Two towns came to a fork in the road

Garden City and Lamar share the same river the same highway the same railroad line and the same Dust Bowl past. And through the 1960s they were roughly the same size.

But the population of Finney County — home to Garden City — has doubled since 1970. It’s now over 38000.

The number of people living in Prowers County — home to Lamar — has slowly slipped under 12000.

Larry Jones has watched the transformation of western Kansas’ largest city from his farm and cattle company that sits just outside of town.

“If you’d been here 20 years ago and looked at it” he said “you wouldn't recognize the town.”

Next door to Jones’ milo field sits the giant boxy structure that resuscitated Garden City: Tyson Foods’ Finney County beef plant. Inside more than 3000 workers — most of them immigrants and refugees — butcher 6000 head of cattle every day.

So what made Garden City and Lamar the two finalists to win this sprawling slaughterhouse in the first place?

As often happens on the High Plains it comes back to water.

Meatpacking plants historically operated in urban centers such as Kansas City and Chicago. But in the 1960s packers began to build plants in the countryside — away from big city unions and closer to cattle and the grain that fattens them through the last few months of their lives.

Around that same time the number of water wells drilled into the Ogallala Aquifer underneath this region skyrocketed. Those wells plus new center pivot irrigation technology allowed farmers to grow more water-intensive crops in places that get hardly any rain.

It created an ecosystem. The aquifer waters the corn. The corn feeds the cows. The cows supply the meatpackers.

“The way to add value to grain is to put it in an animal” Don Stull said. ”And the way to add value to an animal is to slaughter it.”

Choosing to deal with problems of expansion

Stull has tracked the beef industry’s impact on Garden City for more than three decades as a University of Kansas professor and author. He calls it the first of rural America’s food-processing boomtowns — quickly transforming from what he described as a white agrarian community in 1980 to one of the most diverse places in Kansas.

Yet the city’s metamorphosis came with growing pains. Rapid expansion brought plenty of challenges that it’s still dealing with like strains on housing health care education and social services. And because many of the plant workers were and are immigrants and refugees the type of growth the city experienced also worried some white residents.

“But if you ask anybody” Stull said “they'd rather have the problems of growth than the problems of decline.”

That’s why local leaders pushed hard to land the plant four decades ago — offering a “better package” than Lamar Stull said — to help secure the town’s future economically. And so far it has.

The beef industry now pumps around $2 billion into the county’s economy each year. The city has parlayed its growth into becoming the region’s retail hub regularly drawing shoppers from more than 100 miles away — including many from Lamar.

So what would Garden City look like today if the plant had been built somewhere else?

“Well” Stull said “look at Lamar.”

The other side of the equation

Russ Baldwin moved to Lamar the same year the meatpacking plant opened in Garden City. He now runs the local weekly newspaper.

As he ends his driving tour of shuttered businesses he rolls to a stop in a parking lot on the east edge of town. Weeds grow high along the cracks in the pavement.

The four-story building on the other side of a chain-link fence used to house a German bus manufacturer. At its peak it had roughly 600 people on the payroll. In 2006 it laid off the last 300.

“There were no more paychecks. Things were not being bought at grocery stores” Baldwin said. “People were scrambling and there just wasn't another job.”

Between 2000 and 2020 Lamar’s county lost 17% of its population.

It’s a vicious cycle that’s repeated across rural America. Having fewer jobs and businesses makes it hard for towns to attract and retain residents. Having fewer residents makes it hard for towns to get and keep jobs and businesses.

Today Baldwin described Lamar as a mix of people who want to help turn things around for the town and those who still cling to the fading memory of what the town used to be.

“There’s an element in town that reveres the status quo and doesn’t really want to see too much change” he said. “But you can’t stop change I don’t care how hard you try.”

‘Hindsight’s always 20/20’

Stephanie Gonzales wants to change that outlook. She heads the regional economic development organization SECED that tries to tempt employers to move to town.

“We have wide-open spaces so lots of places to put a business” she said. “You can’t beat rural America.”

She grew up in Lamar in the 1980s. Her parents brothers uncles and cousins were among those laid off from the bus-making plant.

Fifteen years later she said Lamar now fights the perception that the town doesn’t have enough people to make it worthwhile for businesses to set up shop there.

Meanwhile residents often drive over an hour to shop in Garden City essentially dooming the few businesses left in Lamar.

“The growth that (Garden City has) experienced could have ... really benefited Lamar” Gonzales said “had there been maybe some different mentality at the time.”

That mentality was a fear of change. Some people in Lamar were worried about the influx of immigrant and refugee workers. She said that kept Lamar from pushing harder to try to get the plant.

“We should have welcomed the diverse numbers of people” she said. “that would have been employed in a facility like that.”

County Commissioner Ron Cook said Lamar has missed out on several opportunities over the years — in addition to the meatpacking plant — because of those fears. So the town has had to adjust.

“We’ve learned. We’re more open to diversity and changing things in the county” Cook said. “I wish they were possibly a little more open with that back in the day.”

Lamar has seen some modest successes. A couple of data and call centers have relocated to town recently. A new $500000 sports complex plans to open early next spring. Residents will soon decide if Lamar will join Colorado’s lucrative recreational marijuana market.

But Wendy Buxton-Andrade another county commissioner said the loss of the meatpacking plant continues to haunt Lamar.

“Forty years later hindsight’s always 20/20” Buxton-Andrade said. “It’s a shame. … We missed a huge opportunity.”

Much of economy tied to Tyson plant

Yet in the High Plains prosperity is no given — even for Garden City.

“If the Tyson plant were to close tomorrow” said Stull the KU professor “Garden City would be in a world of hurt.”

It won’t close tomorrow. But Stull said it’s just a matter of time before this boomtown goes bust.

The end will come when the water — it’s irrigating those crops that feed the cows that end up in the giant slaughterhouses — runs out. Some meatpacking plants have already moved out of the southern High Plains in search of more reliable water sources.

And eventually — likely just decades from now — the Ogallala Aquifer under southwest Kansas will go dry parching Garden City’s beef industry along with it.

“Unless something can be done to turn that trend around” Stull said “ultimately western Kansas will look like eastern Colorado.”

David Condos covers western Kansas for High Plains Public Radio and the Kansas News Service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NuYy5jb20vY29tbXVuaXR5LWNsb3NlLXVwLXVuaW9uLWNvdW50eS1tb3ZpbmctZm9yd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Community close up: Union County moving forward,"Transportation improvements including the Monroe Expressway are changing agrarian Union County. They’re making business easier spurring academic opportunities and creating an inviting quality of life.

The numbers don’t lie: Agriculture is important to Union County. The 2017 Census of Agriculture — the most recent offered by U.S. Department of Agriculture — listed 957 farms cultivating about 46.2% of its 631.5 square miles. They produce almost $482 million in goods including the second-most grain crops and third-most poultry and eggs in the state. Some Union County companies including Marshville’s Edwards Wood Products and Carolina Wood Products work in its “timber basket” producing pallets furniture-grade hardwoods and other items. “Diversity is the key to any business sector’s success” Monroe-Union County Economic Development Executive Director Chris Platé says. Click here or image above to view pdf

“Union County’s agribusiness segment is extremely varied and robust. [It] is a leading producer of row crops livestock equine food processing and timber in the state. Crops and the poultry industry accounted for $411 million in economic activity in 2019. With Tyson Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride as the county’s largest agriculture employers [with 2500 workers combined] 50 million chickens were processed in Union County and put out to market the same year.”

It has been a good year for Union County which has landed six projects that brought $151 million in capital investment and created 410 jobs as of late September. “Precision manufacturing and agribusiness are where the real competitive advantages lie in Union County” Platé says. “Within the precision manufacturing area aerospace is the largest and most significant cluster. Monroe-Union County Economic Development is working hard trying to see if they can duplicate the success of the aerospace initiative with its agribusiness initiative. It’s a complete community effort to seek and develop an agribusiness value chain that would incorporate producers processing facilities markets restaurants and to consumers.”

But more is growing in Union County. Platé says logistics and commercial development play important economic roles too. So does precision manufacturing especially in the aerospace industry whose local investments have exceeded $1 billion since 2002 he says. A big driver of Union’s economic diversification is transportation. And it’s bringing academic opportunities and people with it.

IMPROVING TRAVEL

The $731 million Monroe Expressway opened in 2018 after more than 20 years of planning and development thanks in part to financial roadblocks. But it has been impacting Union County’s economy ever since. Its 18 miles bisects the county from Stallings in the west to Marshville in the east and allows drivers to bypass 27 stop-and-go intersections on the parallel stretch of U.S. 74.

Drivers who enter or exit at eight points and have their distances electronically recorded pay to travel the expressway. Use a Quick Pass transponder and two-axle vehicle and a one-exit trip can cost as little as 27 cents. The entire stretch is $2.66; without one the registered car owner is billed $4.10 by mail. Rates are higher for vehicles with more axles.

Plenty of drivers have been happy to pay for the expressway’s convenience. The county estimated some interchanges handled 20000 vehicles — mostly commercial trucks and commuters — every weekday in 2020. Usage gets a bump in summer when vacationers head to the coast.

But the expressway offers more than a time savings. “Abundant farmland a skilled workforce and a rapidly improving road system for distribution means food processed from Union County farms can reach their customers quickly” Platé says. It’s helping bring people too.

Union County’s population was more than 239000 in 2020 up from about 202000 a decade earlier according to the N.C. Office of State Budget and Management. “The residential segment is booming” says Ron Mahle Monroe-Union County Economic Development’s assistant director for economic development and existing industry. “We’ve had at least 3000 new housing units and these are mainly people employed in many of the industrial centers in the county. There are young couples and young families buying these homes and they’re in the market range of the type of high-quality jobs that we’re bringing and expanding here in Union County. Union County is really attractive to folks in all life phases. It’s a great place to raise a child. And we have over 185 manufacturing companies employing about 15000 people at a very competitive wage rate. We’ve added about 3000 people to the civilian labor force in the last 12 months.”

DEVELOPING WORKFORCE

Wingate University a private institution founded in 1896 has about 3600 students 35 undergraduate majors 38 minors and 10 preprofessional programs. It recently purchased 100 acres near the expressway where it will develop Town and Gown in partnership with the town of Wingate and other investors. “What energizes me about the town of Wingate development project is the transformative impact it will have on the town’s retail commercial and entertainment environment therefore complementing our efforts to advance a thriving university” university president Rhett Brown says.

Platé says Town and Gown will create a distinct impression: “A linear park is part of a multimodal corridor that connects the Main Street Village — a retail component of the plan with approximately 225000 square feet of restaurants brew pubs and specialty shops — to the university downtown Wingate and the corporate areas.” It’ll end at The Knoll a community gathering spot where a historic oak tree grows.

[media-credit id=”3895″ align=”alignright” width=”200″] [/media-credit]

The park will connect the development to a future office and research park “hopefully taking advantage of the close proximity of a university the available workforce and other resources nearby that would provide a competitive advantage for the recruitment of these firms” Platé says. The plan could bring 500000 square feet of corporate office and research space and at least one hotel he says.

Platé says Town and Gown is one of the most exciting projects that his office has been involved in during his 23-year tenure. “It is a truly transformational endeavor for eastern Union County adding the potential for nearly $225 million of economic development investment and the creation of over 1000 new career opportunities for the Wingate area” he says. South Piedmont Community College has campuses in Anson and Union counties and more than 6000 students in career-focused programs. Its Tyson Family Center for Technology for example offers courses in machining welding and

[media-credit id=”3895″ align=”alignleft” width=”400″][/media-credit]

mechanical engineering. Graduates work for a variety of companies including plastic packaging manufacturer Berry Global which has a factory in Monroe. The Center’s enrollment has increased 96% during the past five years. The college also partners with health care providers such as Novant and Atrium. SPCC says 67% of jobs will require high-quality credentials or post-secondary degrees by 2030 but only 49% of workers age 25 to 49 have completed such education.

[media-credit id=”3895″ align=”alignright” width=”500″][/media-credit]

SPCC graduates work at more than 300 companies including ones in aerospace advanced manufacturing and heavy equipment. “Central to our mission is workforce development” SPCC President Maria Pharr says. “We pride ourselves on creating education and training programs with our business and industry partners that meet their specific workforce needs.”

Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Greiner Bio-One Iron Peddlers and Instrument Transformer Equipment are some of the local companies that have partnered with SPCC to create apprenticeships or customized training. They use employer-inspired hands-on studies to train workers meeting staffing needs during tight labor markets. “We see SPCC as the main talent supply channel for our businesses” says Karla Shields who joined SPCC as its associate vice president of economic and workforce development and dean of its School of Applied Science and Technology in August.

MAKING SPACE

Monroe Corporate Center was its namesake city’s first industrial park. Only about 100 acres remain of the 500 it started with more than 25 years ago. Its second park 80-acre AeroPointe Industrial Centre was created for its aerospace cluster. ATI a world-leader in super-alloy development and production took it all. “Since the city began developing its own industrial parks it has attracted $850 million in investment from companies that have created over 2500 jobs” Platé says. “[They] develop products to serve a wide variety of business sectors including aerospace medical device pharmaceutical life safety commercial automotive and construction materials.”

Monroe purchased 155 acres creating Expressway Commerce Park at Monroe in 2018. It sold 82 acres to Windsor Windows & Doors in September. It plans to build a 570000-square-foot factory a more than $80 million capital investment. Union County recently purchased 330 acres for its first industrial park Piedmont Innovation Park. Platé says it already has landed a $140 million aerospace investment from ATI. He says the county is exploring a park to support local agribusinesses. He says the county has 10 agribusiness projects whose investments total about $65 million.

TAKING FLIGHT

A vital link in North Carolina’s 72-airport system Charlotte-Monroe Executive Airport welcomes a variety of aircraft from puddle-jumpers to a $10 million corporate jet. Its hangar space is in demand from an increasing number of private-plane owners many residing in Weddington Waxhaw and Marvin. “People consider moving to that area and they come to me and say ‘Hey I have a plane and I’d love to base it here’” airport Manager Peter Cevallos says. “A lot of business executives live in that area and know we’re 10 minutes from their house. It’s accessible and convenient. The way it has evolved is Charlotte is growing to the south and to the east. People are moving out that way and they have the money to travel and own airplanes.”

Cevallos says his airport’s runways aren’t built for commercial airlines’ 100000-pound planes. “We’re a non-commercial airport” he says. “That means airlines like Delta can’t land here. That’s what makes us different from [Charlotte Douglas International Airport]. That does not take away from us. We just don’t have commercial service.”

[media-credit id=”3895″ align=”alignright” width=”400″] [/media-credit]

The future of air commuting could be as easy as hailing a rideshare. “Yes we’re a corporate airport but people are talking about creating an Uber for air travel” Cevallos says. “You can hire someone to fly you anywhere. You can call and say ‘Hey we need a ride to Amelia Island [in Florida] for our vacation’ and there will be two or three companies who offer you a price. Or we have business travelers who want to go to a small city and be back the same day.”

The airport updates its forward-looking plan with Monroe and the Federal Aviation Administration every 20 years. Its Master Plan Draft Map for 2022-2042 outlines intentions in five-year increments. Additional hangars are a top priority. “The plan does not address the public areas the road system for the airport the runway or taxi way” Cevallos says. “There are plans for that but they aren’t as impactful as the hangars.”

Cevallos compares his hangar plan to a neighborhood. “The top left [of the map] is the big hangars like your million-dollar homes” he says. “On the other side are the smaller squares with smaller hangars. There also are storage facilities like the ones you see around town. We also have outdoor slips like a ramp with tie-down spaces the equivalent of docking your boat. We also have box hangars the equivalent of dry dock. I have 110 in there. Our staff goes in and pulls the airplane out.”

The Master Plan includes a wish-list for amenities outside the airport’s boundaries. “The overall balanced objective on that map is more than 120 hangar structures and a half-million square feet of hangar space in the next 20 years” Cevallos says. “Business has been good for us. We’re still growing. We’re on an upward trajectory.” ■",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb3ZleGVjLmNvbS9vdmVyc2lnaHQvMjAyMS8xMC9hbWVyaWNhcy1mb29kLXNhZmV0eS1zeXN0ZW0tZmFpbGVkLXN0b3Atc2FsbW9uZWxsYS1lcGlkZW1pYy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtbWFraW5nLXBlb3BsZS1zaWNrLzE4NjQ4MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's Food Safety System Failed to Stop a Salmonella Epidemic. It's Still Making People Sick.,"In May 2018 a rare and virulent strain of salmonella caught the attention of America’s top disease detectives. In less than two months the bacteria had sickened more than a dozen people nearly all of them on the East Coast. Many said they’d eaten chicken and federal food safety inspectors found the strain in chicken breasts sausages and wings during routine sampling at poultry plants.

But what seemed like a straightforward outbreak soon took a mystifying turn. Cases surfaced as far away as Texas and Missouri. A 1-year-old boy from Illinois and a 105-year-old woman from West Virginia fell ill. There was a teenager who’d just returned from a service trip in the Dominican Republic and a woman who’d traveled to Nicaragua. But there were also people who hadn’t traveled at all.

Victims were landing in the hospital with roiling stomach pains uncontrollable diarrhea and violent bouts of vomiting. The source of the infections seemed to be everywhere.

Even more alarming was that this strain of salmonella known as multidrug-resistant infantis was invincible against nearly all the drugs that doctors routinely use to fight severe food poisoning.

With a public health threat unfolding across the country you might have expected federal regulators to act swiftly and decisively to warn the public recall the contaminated poultry and compel changes at chicken plants. Or that federal investigators would pursue the root cause of the outbreak wherever the evidence led.

None of that happened.

Instead the team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention closed the outbreak investigation nine months later even though people were continuing to get sick. The U.S. Department of Agriculture which oversees meat and poultry was not only powerless to act but said nothing to consumers about the growing threat. So supermarkets and restaurants continued selling chicken tainted with drug-resistant infantis.

And they continue to do so today.

An eight-month ProPublica investigation into this once rare but now pervasive form of salmonella found that its unchecked spread through the U.S. food supply was all but inevitable the byproduct of a baffling and largely toothless food safety system that is ill-equipped to protect consumers or rebuff industry influence.

Several European countries have dramatically reduced salmonella in poultry by combating it on the farms where chickens are raised. But over the past 25 years the U.S. has failed to bring down the incidence of salmonella food poisoning — even as the rates for E. coli and other bacteria have fallen dramatically.

Consumers may get the impression that the meat and poultry they find at supermarkets is safe because it bears the USDA seal of approval. But the agency doesn’t prohibit companies from selling chicken contaminated with dangerous salmonella like infantis. And even when people get sick it has no power to order recalls.

Instead the agency relies on standards it can’t enforce and that don’t target the types of salmonella most likely to make people sick. The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service unlike its counterparts in some countries has no authority to control salmonella on farms where the bacteria often spreads. And even when there’s persistent evidence of contamination in a plant’s products the USDA can’t use those findings to suspend operations. All the agency can do is conduct a general review of the plant and that rarely leads to a shutdown.

“It’s a system that’s untenable” said Sarah Sorscher a consumer advocate at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

ProPublica as part of its food safety investigation has created an online database that lets consumers look up the salmonella records of the plants that processed their chicken and turkey.

Last week after repeated interview requests from ProPublica and years of criticism from consumer groups the USDA announced that it was rethinking its approach to salmonella. The agency didn’t announce any concrete changes but said it would set up pilot projects and hold meetings in an effort to come up with a plan.

“Whether it should have been done sooner or could have been done sooner the good news is we’re doing it” said Sandra Eskin the agency’s deputy undersecretary for food safety. “We’re going to really take a look at everything we could look at and I hope develop a different approach that winds up being more effective.”

Scientific advancements over the last decade have provided the USDA with tools to identify the most dangerous strains of salmonella. But the agency isn’t using those tools to prevent it from spreading in our food supply.

To piece together how food safety officials and the poultry industry allowed infantis to spread ProPublica used the same genetic data available to the USDA and other agencies analyzing seven years of infantis samples taken from food and patients and catalogued by the National Institutes of Health.

Through dozens of public records requests ProPublica was then able to link the genetic information on those 8000 samples to the foods that victims ate and the processing plants the chicken samples came from.

The analysis along with hundreds of internal government records and interviews with nearly two dozen scientists allowed us to uncover that the infantis outbreak never abated and has continued to run rampant through the chicken industry.

In fact ProPublica found that more than twice a day this year on average USDA inspectors detected multidrug-resistant infantis in poultry that’s genetically similar to the outbreak strain. Each month the CDC continues to receive dozens of reports of people getting sick from it.

“Many people are still becoming ill and some of them gravely ill” Robert Tauxe director of the CDC’s Division of Foodborne Waterborne and Environmental Diseases told ProPublica.

One internal CDC presentation noted that this single strain is “responsible for an estimated 11000-17000 illnesses per year.” But the CDC is limited in its ability to protect American consumers from foodborne illnesses. It has no power to order companies to take action or to provide information that would help it solve outbreaks.

And the CDC despite noting that the strain was “widespread in the chicken industry” took the spotlight off infantis when it closed its outbreak investigation in February 2019. Tauxe said the investigation ended because the agency had learned as much as it could. “That does not mean that the outbreak was over” he said. “In fact we think it may still be expanding.”

As the CDC has contended with infantis the agency has held several private meetings with the chicken industry which has publicly downplayed the threat of the strain and its ability to do something about it.

But since closing the investigation neither federal health officials nor the USDA has said anything to consumers about what the CDC quietly regards as an “epidemic.”

Marva Lamping knew none of this in July 2019 when she took her longtime partner Arthur Sutton out to celebrate his 70th birthday at their favorite Mexican restaurant in Bend Oregon. As Lamping tested her luck at the restaurant’s video slot machines Sutton snacked on chips and salsa while waiting for a platter of chicken enchiladas.

That night Sutton began vomiting repeatedly his stomach aching so badly that he couldn’t lay down. By the next morning the pain was unbearable and Lamping rushed him to the emergency room.

At the hospital doctors would discover that Sutton’s intestines were leaking. Again and again surgeons opened his abdomen to repair the tears and cut out dead segments of his bowels.

Doctors had quickly identified the cause of Sutton’s ailments as salmonella. But for reasons they couldn’t understand his body was wasting away.

None of the antibiotics were working.

Missed Opportunities

As sudden as the infantis outbreak seemed to investigators at the CDC it wasn’t the first time the government had seen this strain known as Infantis Pattern 1080. In the three years before the outbreak started USDA inspectors had found the strain 74 times. But they could do nothing to stop the chicken from going to supermarkets and restaurants nationwide.

By the summer of 2018 people all over the country were falling ill. And as investigators studied the cases clues soon emerged from the USDA which oversees meat and poultry and the Food and Drug Administration which regulates almost all other foods.

The FDA had received a complaint that a dog had recurring diarrhea after eating raw pet food and samples of chicken-and-vegetable dog food tested positive for multidrug-resistant infantis. A few months later a Chicago woman fell sick with the outbreak strain after feeding her dog the same brand. Could the pet food be the source of the outbreak? Possibly but not all the victims had a dog.

There was another lead. Victims reported eating Perdue Farms chicken more than any other brand. Public health officials in Pennsylvania and Minnesota found the outbreak strain in packages of Perdue wings thighs and drumsticks in three supermarkets. And when USDA inspectors found the strain in raw chicken more than a quarter of the samples came from Perdue plants.

The FDA’s investigation had quickly led to a pet food recall. But while the FDA prohibits salmonella in the foods it oversees — including dog and cat food — the USDA allows it in raw meat and poultry destined for human consumption.

When people fall ill the USDA can only request that a company voluntarily recall its products. But to do even that for salmonella regulators face a high bar: To ensure a strong case they’re expected to try to find a patient with an unopened package of meat that tests positive for the same strain that made the outbreak victims sick.

“Often by that time most of the meat that’s going to be eaten has been eaten” said Sorscher of the CSPI.

In June 2018 what could have been a key piece of evidence surfaced. An Illinois victim who’d been hospitalized told investigators that he still had a package of Perdue chicken tenders in his freezer. The USDA could have tested the package but nobody ever went out to collect it he said.

Perdue did not respond to more than a dozen calls and emails seeking comment and it didn’t answer questions sent to top company officials.

Wade Fluckey Perdue’s senior director of food safety at the time told ProPublica that the company was targeted because Perdue has better brand recognition than other chicken companies which skewed patient interviews.

“I don’t know that any one company could say they didn’t have it” said Fluckey now a vice president at a pork processor. “Had they focused on other places they would have found the same thing.”

While no company showed up more frequently than Perdue food inspectors were finding the Pattern 1080 strain in dozens of chicken processing plants as well as raw pet food and live chickens. To investigators that was unusual because it meant that the salmonella couldn’t have come from a single company or chicken product. It had to be coming from somewhere upstream in the supply chain — perhaps the farms or the few companies that breed nearly all the nation’s chickens.

The country’s antiquated meat safety system virtually ensured it would be no match for a germ like infantis.

The USDA operates under a law passed in 1906 where inspectors physically examine every carcass for signs of animal disease illegal additives and spoilage. The system didn’t account for invisible pathogens like salmonella and E. coli which had not yet been linked to eating meat.

That did not change until 1994 after four children died from eating Jack in the Box hamburgers. The USDA made it illegal to sell meat tainted with a strain of E. coli called O157:H7. But it didn’t ban salmonella despite a series of high-profile outbreaks in chicken. Instead the USDA required processing plants to limit how often salmonella was found on their products and began testing for it. Plants that repeatedly violated these standards faced a shutdown.

That powerful threat didn’t last long. In 1999 a Texas meat processor challenged the USDA’s authority to close plants arguing that salmonella “appears naturally” in raw meat. Two years later the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that Congress hadn’t given the agency the power to regulate salmonella that’s present before products enter processing plants or to deem a facility unsanitary based on the bacteria alone.

The decision Supreme Beef Processors v. USDA has left the agency gun-shy according to former department officials and food safety advocates. And Mansour Samadpour a microbiologist who runs a testing and consulting firm that works with the food industry said the decision distorts the underlying science. Just because salmonella “colonizes” chickens’ guts doesn’t mean it’s “the natural state of the animal” he said. “It’s nonsense.”

The court ruling severely clipped the USDA’s powers. So it has tried to pressure plants to improve by creating standards for how often salmonella should be found. Plants are rated on the results which are published online. Violating those standards doesn’t carry a penalty but it allows the agency to visit the plant and look for more general problems like unsanitary conditions. If they can document significant problems the USDA can temporarily shut down the plant though the agency rarely takes such action.

Today food poisoning sickens roughly 1 in 6 Americans every year according to the CDC and salmonella hospitalizes and kills more people than any other foodborne pathogen. Each year about 1.35 million people get sick from salmonella. While most recover more than 400 people die and 26500 people are hospitalized. Some are left with long-term conditions like severe arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. Salmonella costs the economy an estimated $4.1 billion a year more than any other type of food poisoning.

Salmonella outbreaks have been linked to other foods like onions but poultry remains the biggest culprit and people are eating more of it than ever. On average people in the U.S. eat nearly 100 pounds of chicken each year a number that has grown by about 40% in the last 25 years.

Cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 degrees will kill salmonella. But studies by the USDA and others have found that despite decades of consumer education home cooks routinely cross-contaminate their kitchens and few use a meat thermometer to ensure their poultry is cooked properly.

Illnesses haven’t declined even as salmonella rates in raw poultry have. And infections are getting harder to treat. The CDC recently found that salmonella infections were becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. In contrast food poisoning related to E. coli O157:H7 has dropped by about 70%.

Consumer advocates industry consultants and former USDA officials say that’s because the agency focuses solely on whether salmonella is found in chicken or turkey at the processing plant.

This approach has been criticized for years. One former meatpacking executive called it “worthless.” Even the USDA’s own research arm has said the agency’s measure for salmonella is “not a good indicator” of food safety.

The USDA doesn’t consider two key risk factors: how much salmonella is in the poultry and how dangerous that type of salmonella is. There are 2500 types of salmonella but only a fraction cause the vast majority of illnesses.

The industry has greatly reduced the prevalence of one common type of the bacteria known as salmonella Kentucky which rarely causes illnesses in the U.S. But it’s made far less progress with the types of salmonella most likely to make people sick the ProPublica analysis found.

The rate of infantis for example has more than quintupled over the past six years.

The full extent of the salmonella problem isn’t even known. The agency does little testing for salmonella to begin with. On an average day in 2020 the USDA took about 80 samples of raw poultry across hundreds of processing plants. But those plants slaughter more than 25 million chickens and turkeys a day.

In recent years consumer advocates have recommended the agency ban the sale of raw meat carrying the types of salmonella that most often make people sick. That approach has contributed to improvements in Europe. In the U.S. the FDA has seen a dramatic decrease in salmonella outbreaks tied to eggs since the 1990s when it began targeting the most common type.

Last month a few of the largest poultry companies including Perdue and Tyson joined with the CSPI and other consumer advocates to urge the USDA to fix the system. But the letter to the agency didn’t outline specific reforms and a consensus on salmonella regulations has long proved elusive.

The last push came during the Obama administration but citing the need for more data the USDA rejected a proposal to ban certain antibiotic-resistant strains. The agriculture secretary at the time was Tom Vilsack who now leads the agency again under President Joe Biden.

As the food safety project director for the Pew Charitable Trusts before joining the USDA Eskin also pushed for reform but her efforts were met with resistance. With food safety directors from some of the largest companies she helped craft recommendations to Congress to modernize the meat safety system including setting new limits on salmonella contamination and giving regulators oversight of farms.

The group sought to enlist trade associations which represent not only the biggest players but hundreds of other companies. But when it comes to regulation divergent interests often leave the trade groups lobbying for the lowest common denominator. “They shut us down” she said in an interview before taking her government post. “They’re the ones that blocked us — not the companies the trade associations.”

Asked what was standing in the way of change she said “I’ll make it simple: Powerful interests in the industry do not want it.”

“We Are Basically Only Talking About Protecting Industry”

Just months before the infantis outbreak started the USDA gathered representatives from the food industry researchers and regulators at the agency’s brick-and-limestone headquarters in Washington to discuss a scientific breakthrough that one participant called the “biggest thing” for food safety in 100 years.

Whole-genome sequencing had given food safety researchers an unprecedented look at the DNA of foodborne bacteria. New technology known as “next-generation sequencing” was creating a trove of new information and revealing connections that could help investigators stop outbreaks before they spun out of control.

As stakeholders took turns presenting slides in the wood-paneled auditorium some spoke of the possibility that genome sequencing might help solve the stagnant rate of salmonella poisoning.

The new technology would help identify pathogens in foods like raw flour peaches and romaine lettuce that were once rarely seen as sources of outbreaks.

While whole-genome sequencing couldn’t confirm the source of an outbreak without additional evidence it provided powerful clues about the bacteria’s genetic history that could point epidemiologists in the right direction.

But for all the potential much of the conversation that day in October 2017 centered on how to make this scientific breakthrough palatable to industry. Trade groups had requested the meeting and they voiced concerns about how the new tool could be used for enforcement or might inaccurately connect companies’ products to outbreaks. Speakers including USDA officials emphasized the importance of proceeding with caution. They discussed strengthening firewalls to keep testing data private and establishing “safe harbors” from USDA enforcement.

During a roundtable discussion one representative from the United Fresh Produce Association raised concerns about the idea of companies sharing genome sequencing data with the government. “I think right now it’s viewed as very one-sided” she said. “We see the benefit to the agencies but it’s less clear how a company would directly benefit.”

The industry’s influence wasn’t lost on regulators. Former USDA officials hold key posts at some of the food industry’s biggest companies. Indeed two people who led the 2017 meeting for the agency now work for the food industry.

Sitting in the auditorium Jørgen Schlundt the former head of food safety for the World Health Organization was growing increasingly frustrated. Schlundt had helped achieve dramatic reductions in salmonella in Denmark while working for the country’s food agency.

“I understand that I’m in the U.S. but surely this must also be about protecting consumers” he told the audience. “We are basically only talking about protecting industry here. I thought that this was the basic purpose was to protect consumers avoid American consumers and other consumers from dying from eating food.”

While the USDA tiptoed around the new technology whole-genome sequencing which is now used to solve criminal cases and track COVID-19 variants would prove pivotal to the CDC’s infantis investigation.

As the infantis outbreak spread epidemiologists noticed something unusual: The outbreak strain Pattern 1080 carried an unusual combination of antibiotic-resistance genes that looked similar to another strain they’d seen before Louise Francois Watkins an epidemiologist at the CDC said in an interview.

At the time the CDC was still using a method called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or PFGE which produced barcode-like patterns from the bacteria’s DNA that scientists used to connect cases. So the investigators asked the lab to line up the patterns and compare the two strains.

“And sure enough” Francois Watkins said the strains were so similar they differed by “only a single band” of the barcode. With that clue they decided to analyze the strains using whole-genome sequencing.

That allowed scientists to compare the individual building blocks in the genomes of bacteria. And the infantis investigators discovered that not only were the two strains genetically similar but that PFGE was masking the scope of the problem.

In fact Pattern 1080 was just one wave in a much larger surge of drug-resistant infantis — one that had been detected nearly a decade ago in Israel and was now circulating worldwide in countries as far apart as Italy Peru and Vietnam.

One of the reasons the U.S. variant is so concerning is that it typically carries a unique gene that makes it especially hard to treat.

“It’s resistant to four of the five antibiotics that are commonly recommended for treatment” Francois Watkins said. “The antibiotics that your doctor is going to pick when they suspect you have a salmonella infection are pretty likely not to be effective.”

The strain is also a major public health concern because it has the ability to pass those genes to other bacteria adding to the growing global problem of antibiotic resistance.

“We don’t want to see resistance climbing in our food supply because it’s not going to stay in that one space” Francois Watkins said.

Whole-genome sequencing had helped investigators discover that the outbreak was actually a widespread problem in the country’s chicken supply.

But even with these new revelations public health officials still lacked one of the most basic tools to control the strain.

“A Gap in Our Regulations”

CDC investigators knew that infantis was spreading in chickens long before the birds arrived at the slaughterhouse. But enlisting the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service would be a dead end because the agency has no regulatory authority over farms. The USDA can only force farms to take measures when animals get sick not when humans do.

That also made it difficult for the CDC investigators to pursue leads involving breeders and feed suppliers to trace back how dangerous bacteria got into the food supply.

“That’s a gap in our regulations” Tauxe of the CDC said.

Nearly all the chickens we eat descend from birds bred by two companies Aviagen and Cobb-Vantress a subsidiary of Tyson Foods. This breeding process has allowed consumers to walk into any grocery store and find chicken of the same quality. But that pyramid structure also makes it possible for salmonella to circulate since the bacteria can be transferred from hens to their offspring and a single breeding flock might produce 3 million chickens over several years. (Both companies declined to comment.)

And nearly every step of their journey from chicken house to our plates presents an opportunity for salmonella to spread.

As far back as 2005 the USDA has held public meetings exhorting the poultry industry to take steps at the farm. It has recommended that farmers change or chemically treat the litter between flocks use traps and bait to eliminate pests and vaccinate hens and chicks against salmonella.

Denmark Sweden and Norway have largely eradicated salmonella on farms by keeping chicken houses clean frequently testing the birds and destroying infected breeding flocks.The United Kingdom has dramatically reduced salmonella illnesses by pressuring the industry to vaccinate.

The structure of the U.S. chicken industry makes it ideally suited to implement such interventions. The same company that slaughters the chickens often owns the hatchery and feed mill and it contracts with farmers to raise the chickens to its specifications. The catch is that because companies are essentially doing business with themselves there’s little incentive for any of them to press others to reduce salmonella the industry consultant Samadpour said.

“If it was four or five different companies” he said “the processing plant would tell the farms ‘If you are more than so much positive you can’t send it here’ the farm would tell the hatchery ‘If the chicks coming in are positive we are not going to take them.’ They would tell the feed mill that if the feed is contaminated with salmonella ‘We are not going to bring it in.’ Can you do that? No it all belongs to you.”

Because more isn’t done on the farm the birds’ skin and feathers are often highly contaminated with salmonella by the time they reach the processing plant according to the USDA. And in the plant there are many ways bacteria can spread.

Birds can be further cross-contaminated when workers cut carcasses into breasts legs and wings. The USDA recommends workers wash their hands and sanitize knives between each bird. But workers often have a few seconds to make each cut.

Ground chicken which has become increasingly popular is especially prone to contamination. Meat sent to the grinder comes from multiple birds increasing the chance of cross-contamination. The fine texture of ground chicken can also get caught in small pieces of equipment potentially tainting multiple batches.

While salmonella is found in 8% of the chicken parts tested by the USDA 25% of ground chicken samples contain the bacteria.

And when the USDA tested for salmonella during the infantis outbreak more than half of the positive samples were found in ground chicken.

“The Company Can Do Whatever It Wants”

In July 2018 as outbreak investigators began to discover infantis in Perdue products the USDA had a chance to press the company for answers. Routine salmonella testing had found that the company’s plant in Cromwell Kentucky was exceeding the USDA’s salmonella standards which say no more than 15.4% of chicken parts at a plant should test positive for the pathogen.

So USDA staff were sent to conduct an assessment of the plant which might have seemed well-timed. Of the 76 plants where the infantis outbreak strain had been found Cromwell with 8% of the positive samples had more than any other facility. But failing the agency’s salmonella standard doesn’t give the USDA the power to do anything more than review the plant’s practices.

The USDA noted that Perdue had responded to its high rate of salmonella by adding more chemical dip tanks and sprays to disinfect the chicken. Because Perdue’s internal sampling data showed the new steps appeared to be reducing the bacteria the agency gave Perdue more time and recommended “no further action be taken.”

According to the USDA report Fluckey then the food safety director at Perdue told auditors that the agency’s testing didn’t paint an accurate picture of the plant because it wasn’t measuring the quantity of salmonella. He added that Perdue managers hadn’t concentrated on the salmonella types most likely to make people sick because they were focused on “meeting the performance standard.”

A year later USDA sampling indicated that the plant had continued to violate salmonella standards with a third of chicken parts testing positive for the bacteria. In addition the USDA said 12 of Perdue’s samples were highly related genetically to samples from people who’d recently gotten sick.

Still the agency once again deferred to the company’s testing results which showed a decrease in the rate of salmonella at the plant. The USDA decided it couldn’t cite the plant and that no action was necessary.

ProPublica found that many plants have repeatedly violated the agency’s standards without being shut down or facing any recent public sanction. According to the most recent data more than a third of the plants producing ground chicken are violating the USDA standard. And many large companies — including Tyson Pilgrim’s Pride Perdue Koch Foods and the processors that produce chicken for Costco and Whole Foods — currently have plants with high rates of the types of salmonella most likely to make people sick.

Whole Foods said it has a team of experts who review the salmonella results of its suppliers and works with them to lower their salmonella rates. The processor Pine Manor Farms said it has “worked diligently to make corrections.” Tyson and Costco declined to comment; Pilgrim’s and Koch didn’t respond to questions.

Other Perdue plants where the infantis outbreak strain was found also had a poor track record with salmonella overall. In the last three years its plants in Rockingham North Carolina and Georgetown Delaware had more than 35% of their ground chicken samples test positive for the bacteria and nearly all of them were types commonly linked to human illnesses. Yet neither plant has faced any recent public enforcement action according to a review of USDA reports. (In April ProPublica requested detailed files for both plants but the USDA has yet to provide them.)

In an interview before she joined the USDA Eskin said the consequences for companies violating the standards aren’t “anything meaningful in terms of enforcement.” “At the end of the day” she said “I think the company can do whatever it wants.”

The USDA doesn’t appear to have traced the supply chain for the plants that tested positive for the outbreak strain. Detroit Sausage had one of the highest numbers of samples with the strain.

Phil Peters one of the owners said he doesn’t remember anyone from the USDA asking the company who supplied its chicken. “I can’t control something that’s coming in from somewhere else unless I stop using it” he said.

The company no longer produces chicken sausage because his clients no longer order it. But as a small processor Peters said he has little ability to demand chicken companies provide him meat carrying less salmonella. “They’re too big to worry about us” he said.

A Hidden “Epidemic”

With no powers of its own and stuck with a hesitant regulator in the USDA the CDC’s investigators needed the industry’s help.

On Aug. 8 2018 the CDC offered a stark assessment of the outbreak to representatives of the industry’s trade group the National Chicken Council: Drug-resistant infantis had become a “particular clinical and public health concern” because it was spreading through the chicken industry and increasingly making people sick.

The USDA seemed to take a less urgent approach. After an Aug. 16 foodborne illness investigations meeting with infantis on the agenda an agency official wrote that there were “zero active illness investigations.” The USDA had begun tracing victims’ grocery purchases but beyond that it decided infantis was an “illness cluster” to watch — not a situation that required additional resources.

By then three months into the outbreak investigation neither the CDC nor the USDA had said anything to consumers.

People continued to get sick. Twelve days after the USDA meeting a New York City resident began having stomach cramps. The patient’s spouse told investigators the victim had eaten and shopped in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. The patient went to the hospital but died two days later the first known fatality from the infantis outbreak.

For nearly two months there was still no public warning.

In October 2018 the CDC privately met again with the National Chicken Council. By then public health officials were convinced that the outbreak strain originated high up in the chicken supply chain.

“The outbreak strain may be persisting in chicken populations their environments or their feed” according to the CDC’s presentation to the industry group. “Further investigation is needed to help prevent new illnesses and similar outbreaks in the future.”

The CDC drew up a list of questions for the National Chicken Council:

How was it possible that so many different companies could have the same strain of salmonella infantis? Were common sources of chickens eggs or other farming products widely used? Would one or more companies be willing to partner with the CDC and USDA to explore possible connections?

The council didn’t have many answers. According to a government official’s notes the industry said that it “does a lot to try to reduce salmonella across the board” but that it didn’t have a specific preventative measure for infantis. An industry representative added that it “might have been helpful to have the discussion 4 years ago” when the first signs of drug-resistant infantis popped up in processing plants.

A few days after the October meeting a 2-year-old Michigan girl began rubbing her belly before developing a fever and diarrhea making her the latest Pattern 1080 patient. Her parents said that before she got sick she’d eaten chicken nuggets and touched a package of raw chicken in their kitchen.

The next day — more than nine months after the first patient from the outbreak got sick — the CDC issued its first public notice. By then 92 people in 29 states had been infected with the outbreak strain. But the number was likely far higher: The CDC estimates that for every confirmed salmonella case an additional 30 are never reported. That meant that nearly 3000 people had likely been infected.

Though the CDC knew that infantis wasn’t a typical outbreak strain the notice offered little advice to consumers other than to remind them to follow standard food safety steps when handling raw poultry. The CDC told ProPublica that there was little more it could say to consumers. Infantis was so pervasive Tauxe said that the CDC couldn’t tell consumers to avoid any specific kind of chicken or brand.

Instead public health officials held another private meeting with the chicken industry in February 2019 telling trade organization officials that they considered this strain of infantis to be an “epidemic.”

The CDC emphasized how risky this particular bacteria was because of its resistance to first-line drugs used to treat salmonella especially illnesses involving children and patients with blood infections.

Health officials also presented the clues that had pointed toward Perdue as a potential source of some of the illnesses. The agency wanted to sit down with Perdue but with no power to compel the company to answer questions it would be months before a meeting happened.

A little over a week after the February 2019 meeting with industry the CDC closed its investigation. In its second and last public notice about the outbreak it said 129 people had gotten sick 25 had been hospitalized and one person had died. There was no mention of Perdue or any other company.

In ending the investigation the CDC seemed to send mixed messages. While the agency noted that “illnesses could continue because this salmonella strain appears to be widespread in the chicken industry” it also told Consumer Reports that the decision was prompted by a decrease in new cases.

Infantis Strikes Another Victim

Five months after the CDC closed the infantis investigation Arthur Sutton and Marva Lamping walked into El Rodeo a lively Mexican restaurant in Bend Oregon where copper art hangs on rustic yellow walls and red-clay mosaics line the archways.

The couple typically went there at least once a month after paying their mortgage or when friends were in town. Sutton’s stomach had been bothering him since eating there the week before but he didn’t know why. He decided he was up for going out anyway. It was his 70th birthday and the couple always went to El Rodeo for their birthdays.

Lamping and Sutton had met 15 years earlier at the local community college when Sutton decided to put his past struggles with addiction to constructive use by becoming a counselor. After math class a group of students would go out to a Mexican restaurant.

“He just one day said ‘I noticed when we go out for nachos that you don’t have a margarita with all the other ladies’” Lamping said. “And I said ‘No I don’t drink and drive.’ And he said: ‘Well I’ll give you a ride. If you’d like a margarita I’ll take you.’”

Lamping 63 was drawn to Sutton’s warm and accepting way of engaging with the world — a demeanor that seemed perfectly suited for his counseling work. Lamping said his clients clearly had a bond with him. Once while he and Lamping were stuck in construction traffic a former client working as a flagger recognized Sutton and came over to shake his hand.

Sutton a large man with a square chin broad forehead and glasses was quieter than usual that night as a waiter brought out tortilla chips salsa and a small oval dish of chopped cabbage slaw mixed with diced jalapenos tomatoes and cilantro. Lamping went to play a few rounds of video slots in the back of the restaurant before dinner while Sutton dug into the salsa and slaw.

Those appetizers would take on grave importance for Lamping after Sutton developed severe food poisoning that night. She said that during its investigation of Sutton’s illness the county Health Department would ask her if Sutton had eaten salsa and slaw which an investigator later described in an internal email as the “likely culprit” behind multiple food poisoning cases connected to the restaurant.

El Rodeo’s owner Rodolfo Arias said he “didn’t know anything” about the investigation.

An inspection of the restaurant would find concerns with cross-contamination because El Rodeo thawed and washed frozen chicken in the same three-compartment sink in which it washed lettuce tomatoes and cilantro. Inspectors also noted the faucet was “uncleanable” because it was wrapped in black tape.

Arias denied that his restaurant was responsible for Sutton’s illness. “I don’t think it was possible” Arias said.

After dinner the ache in Sutton’s stomach erupted. He began vomiting and couldn’t lay down to sleep. By the next morning he could no longer stand the pain. He called Lamping at work where she handles patient admissions at St. Charles Medical Center. She went home and took him to the emergency room several hundred feet from her desk.

After a CT scan a doctor diagnosed Sutton who was obese and had other medical problems with a hernia. He was discharged with plans for surgery.

But the pain didn’t go away. Ongoing diarrhea sent him to the toilet every 10 minutes. He tried to hide his pain but Lamping finally convinced him to return to the hospital. “I’m looking into your eyes right now Arthur” she remembers telling him. “You’re dying.”

Sutton’s hospital stay detailed in 2000 pages of medical records provided by Lamping would be marked by one wrenching episode after another. In the emergency room when a nurse put a feeding tube up his nose blood started gushing out.

Still Sutton maintained his signature equanimity. Medical staff described him in notes as “very relaxed and accepting and taking it all in stride.”

Initially the intensive care doctors thought Sutton was still struggling with the effects of a complex hernia. But in the operating room it became clear that things were worse than doctors imagined. His bowels were severely damaged. Surgeons set about removing dead segments of his intestines and reconnecting the functioning parts. They also noted that Sutton had an acute kidney injury caused by “profound” dehydration and septic shock from a widespread infection.

Over 16 days Sutton underwent a similar procedure seven more times. Surgeons cut out pieces of dead intestine centimeter by centimeter and tried to repair tears and leaks in his bowels. Sutton was going in for surgery so often they placed a medical dressing over his abdomen so they wouldn’t have to cut him open every time.

Throughout Sutton cycled through periods of decline followed by flashes of normalcy. Sleep-deprived he began hallucinating that there were monkeys in trees and sailboats emerging from the ceiling. But he was also able to sit in a hallway chair in the sun with Lamping eat a popsicle and jokingly tell the physical therapist “You look like Tom Cruise.”

Still Sutton was deteriorating. One day Lamping found a note on the bedside table that Sutton had scratched out: “Why is this happening?”

Sutton’s doctors were also puzzled. After the first surgery they’d quickly identified salmonella as the source of Sutton’s illness and immediately started antibiotics. But after nearly a week they couldn’t understand why there was no improvement.

What Sutton’s doctors didn’t yet know was that a pernicious type of bacteria was poisoning Sutton’s blood: the strain of multidrug-resistant infantis circulating throughout the chicken industry.

To Industry the Mystery of Infantis “Went Away”

A month before Sutton got sick the CDC’s top foodborne disease experts held another meeting with the National Chicken Council. This time Perdue and four other big chicken processors were at the table.

Internal agency notes drafted before the meeting showed officials bracing for an unreceptive audience. “They have known about our concerns for years” the notes read. “They know about European practices. As a member-run trade association their position is often driven by the lowest common denominator. Business margins are ‘razor’ thin; some companies are unable or unwilling to embrace expensive control strategies upstream.”

During the three-hour meeting the group discussed salmonella prevention and lessons learned from infantis.

But the CDC’s message — that infantis was a serious problem that demanded action — doesn’t seem to have resonated with Ashley Peterson the industry representative who organized and attended the meeting. In September 2019 Peterson the National Chicken Council’s senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs told trade magazine Poultry Health Today that infantis wasn’t a problem anymore according to a video of the interview.

“We don’t really understand where it came from or why it went away” Peterson said.

Learning of Peterson’s comments Tauxe of the CDC seemed surprised and puzzled.

“It didn’t go away” he said. “We have met with the NCC repeatedly and have emphasized with them that it’s an ongoing problem. That’s wishful thinking of some kind.”

National Chicken Council spokesperson Tom Super said Peterson was referring to the CDC investigation ending and only learned later that the CDC was still seeing cases of infantis. He added that the industry has invested tens of millions of dollars a year in food safety and it has never downplayed infantis.

More than two years after Peterson’s comments — as infantis has sickened thousands more people — the trade group still hasn’t answered most of the CDC’s questions about the strain and has shared little with the agency about efforts to curb it Tauxe said.

“How it got into the chickens in the first place and why it expanded across the country through the chickens and why it’s persisting remain open questions for us” he said. “Stopping it is going to depend on what the industry is willing to step up to and do.”

Super denied that the industry hadn’t answered the CDC’s questions but didn’t provide responses when ProPublica posed them again. “The industry never stopped working to address salmonella infantis — an effort that continues today” he said.

Swifter action might have made the difference for Sutton.

At the hospital in Oregon Sutton’s prognosis worsened. By mid-August 2019 the doctors had learned that the type of salmonella ravaging Sutton’s body was infantis. The finding might have helped doctors change course but it was too late. The bacteria had already taken its toll.

Back in his room after a half-dozen surgeries Sutton signaled to Lamping waving two hands to show that he was done. “He just kept going: ‘Enough enough. No more’” Lamping said.

She looked at Sutton and shook her head refusing to give up. But there wasn’t much the doctors could do.

During his eighth visit to the operating room a surgeon noted that the leak in his bowels was probably so deep that it wasn’t accessible to surgeons: “Any further dissection would be significantly risking more bowel injury and making his current problem worse” the medical records said.

More than two weeks into his hospital stay Sutton’s salmonella infection had led to kidney failure. Sutton would need round-the-clock dialysis and a feeding tube to survive.

Lamping and Sutton’s brother Jim gathered in Sutton’s room to decide what to do. They agreed that Sutton wouldn’t want to live constantly hooked up to machines.

They told the hospital to stop treatment and move him to comfort care. “Time for him to go to heaven” Jim Sutton said. After life support was removed Lamping sat next to the bed and rested her head on Arthur’s hand.

The next day on Aug. 16 2019 Arthur Sutton died. The cause was severe blood poisoning and acute organ dysfunction brought on by salmonella. Lamping was paralyzed by grief. Her visions of the future had always included him.

“I watched a man go from happy-go-lucky — someone who should have been with me another 20 years — I lost him” Lamping said. “I Iost him.”

Two years later she still replays Sutton’s battle with salmonella over in her mind certain that something could have been done differently.

Lamping has focused on potential problems with how their food was handled at El Rodeo and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against the restaurant in 2020. She blames the restaurant in part because a county health inspection after Sutton died noted that it had told El Rodeo about the “findings from the state health lab on salmonella infantis cases.” In court filings the restaurant denied the allegations.

But Lamping also says there are things that food safety regulators and the industry could have done long before the chicken arrived at El Rodeo.

“If they know that infantis is in the chicken if they know it’s there why are they selling it to us?” Lamping asked.

The USDA to this day has never said anything to consumers about the risk of multidrug-resistant infantis.

Because of the pandemic Lamping and Jim Sutton have had to delay Arthur’s memorial. They hope that someday soon they’ll be able to gather his friends and family on a hill overlooking a canyon in central Oregon.

They’ll walk through shale rock wildflowers and junipers and look over the canyon’s edge where a buck can sometimes be seen running through the sagebrush. They’ll open Sutton’s urn and let the wind carry his ashes away.

About the Data: How ProPublica Analyzed Bacterial Pathogen Presence

Data Used

ProPublica obtained bacterial pathogen genomic sequencing data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Pathogen Detection project. The project integrates data from bacterial pathogens sampled from food the environment and human patients by participating public health agencies in the United States and around the world. The NCBI analyzes data as it is submitted and the results are monitored by public health agencies including the CDC as part of foodborne illness outbreak investigations. The data includes metadata about each bacterial isolate submitted by the person or institute who collected the bacterial sample as well as computational predictions by NCBI.

Through Freedom of Information Act requests ProPublica obtained epidemiological information about bacterial samples taken as part of the 2018-19 salmonella infantis outbreak investigation and samples obtained during routine testing in establishments regulated by the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. ProPublica also obtained epidemiological information connected to patients considered part of this outbreak including the date of sample collection and details about a patient’s illness recent food consumption and demographics — details crucial to foodborne illness investigations. Data about bacteria found during USDA inspections also included the type of meat or poultry the sample was obtained from the date of collection and the name and location of the facility. Integrating these details with the NCBI metadata offered a way to group samples together not just by genetic similarity but also by location and time.

The USDA posts public datasets containing the results of its salmonella sampling at poultry processing plants since 2015 which detail the collection date type of poultry product sampled and if salmonella was present information on type and any antimicrobial resistance. The datasets include both routine sampling conducted at every plant and follow-up sampling conducted at plants where the agency has identified high levels of salmonella. (Samples from USDA inspections that contain salmonella are reflected in both the NCBI data and the agency’s inspection data.)

Analysis Decisions

To confirm the persistence of multidrug-resistant infantis in food processing facilities grocery stores and patients with salmonella infections ProPublica relied on both metadata submitted to NCBI and genetic features computed by NCBI. ProPublica restricted its analysis to isolates in the NCBI data belonging to what was known as SNP cluster PDS000089910.78 as of Oct. 19 2021. This cluster contains most isolates involved in the infantis outbreak and the CDC said it is monitoring most of the isolates in the cluster. ProPublica also filtered for isolates that were reported to be serotype infantis by the submitter or when user-submitted information was unavailable were computationally predicted to be infantis by the NCBI data processing pipeline.

ProPublica used data about evolutionary modeling computed by NCBI to establish the degree of genetic similarity between bacterial isolates from the outbreak and isolates collected more recently.

ProPublica’s analysis of salmonella rates in poultry plants is based on methods the USDA uses using the agency’s routine sampling data to calculate positivity rates — that is the number of positive tests compared with all salmonella tests taken at the facility — for each type of poultry a plant processed. ProPublica also calculated the high-risk salmonella rate for plants determining the percentage of samples at the facility that tested positive for one of the 30 salmonella types the CDC has found to be most associated with human illnesses.

The USDA inspection data was also used to compare the number of samples found to contain salmonella infantis and salmonella Kentucky with the total number of routine samples taken each year to determine the rate at which each was occurring in the sampling program across all plants and poultry types.

The Parmesan Chicken Bites have 14 grams of protein while the Spicy Chicken Bites boast 13 grams (via PR Newswire). Moreover these snacks have 75% less fat and 35% fewer calories than fast-food fried chicken.

Registered dietitian nutritionist Bansari Acharya explained to HuffPost that air frying ""preserves the nutrients in the food items as it doesn't expose it to hot oils. It also reduces the amount of trans and saturated fats in foods reducing the risk for heart disease."" However BBC Good Food cautions that air-fried food is still technically fried food and it should be treated as such. In other words it's a healthier alternative but it is not as healthy as reducing the amount of fried food a person eats.

Of course the Air Fried Chicken Bites are playing to an audience that wants air-fried chicken. Whether people will enjoy this particular air-fried chicken is another matter. On Facebook one person said that the concept sounded like a ""knockout."" Reviews for Spicy Chicken Bites on Tyson's website however have been mixed so far. One person thought they were amazing while another thought ""These were nasty. These were nasty. These were nasty."" A third complained that the pieces didn't come in a uniform size meaning that they didn't cook evenly. Taste after all is quite subjective."

Berkeley

Berkeley ‘State of the Village’ luncheon scheduled for Nov. 9

During a regular meeting on Oct. 5 Berkeley village officials stated that the Hillside-Berkeley Chamber of Commerce and Industry will host the Berkeley State of the Village Luncheon on Tuesday Nov. 9 on the second floor of Berkeley Village Hall 5819 Electric Ave. in Berkeley. The luncheon is free of charge but you’ll need to make a reservation by calling (708) 449-8840 by Friday Nov. 5.

First Financial Credit Union moving into town

During that same Oct. 5 meeting village officials said that First Financial Credit Union will be moving into the former US Bank building at 5401 St. Charles Rd. in Berkeley “most likely in the next month” according to meeting minutes.

According to the website of the Redmond Company which specializes in building out and designing financial institutions the First Financial location coming to Berkeley is undergoing a “small footprint renovation that maximizes efficiency and incorporates unique branding elements” including the incorporation of “wood from railroad ties at the teller lines to recognize the community’s history.”

Berkeley village officials said on Oct. 5 that they’ll be organizing a ribbon-cutting ceremony once the location is operational. Construction on the branch started in the summer of 2021 according to Redmond.

Berkeley and Hillside youth baseball organizations to merge

During his Berkeley Baseball 2022 report on Oct. 5 Berkeley Village President Robert Lee said that “big changes” are coming to Berkeley Baseball 2022 particularly as they merge with Hillside. Some of the changes include rebuilt dugouts. We’re working on a larger story about this so more information to come.

Hillside

Streets due for resurfacing identified

During a Sept. 13 Hillside Board of the Whole meeting Village Engineer John Nelson outlined the streets that were included in the 2021 Street Resurfacing Project which is starting this month.

The streets slated for resurfacing are located east of Wolf Road south of Madison south of Warren and West of Forest Nelson said.

Hillside resident Anthony Simpson who lives on Jackson Boulevard wanted to know whether or not his street is scheduled for repairs. Jackson said “he has discussed this several times and said the street is deteriorating and needs repair very soon” according to the minutes.

When Trustee David Delgado asked whether or not Jackson would be resurfaced Hillside Village Administrator Joe Pisano said that preliminary water main work needs to happen before the street can be resurfaced. Pisano said that the water main work will be completed in the spring of 2022.

Westchester

Westchester’s future village hall coming along as redevelopment of old village hall encounters some delay

During a regular meeting on Oct. 18 Westchester Village Manager Paul Nosek said that construction on the new municipal complex at 2305-2315 Enterprise Drive in Westchester is expected to start no later than Jan. 1 2022.

Nosek said that the village budgeted roughly $215000 on interior demolition services — around $55000 on the 2305 building where public works will be located and no more than $160000 on the 2315 building where village hall will be located.

The village contracted with Lockport-based UGX LLC to conduct the demolition services which include the removal of interior walls ceiling tiles carpet and other materials.

Nosek said UGX demolished 2305 and saved the village about $35000 in material that’s being used in the 2315 building. Prompted by the firm’s work on the 2305 building the board contracted it to do demolition work on the 2315 building.

“We’re at the point right now where we’ll have final drawings and go out to bid for the construction part of it” Nosek said on Oct. 18.

Meanwhile the redevelopment of the site of the current Village Hall at 10300 Roosevelt Rd. is encountering some delay.

During a regular meeting on Oct. 26 the Westchester Village Board voted unanimously to grant an extension to the developers of the 10300 Roosevelt Road and 1107 South Mannheim Road properties.

Back in June Village Free Press reported that the Village Board had voted on purchase and sale agreements that would result in a range of retailers including an Aldi Foods and a Starbucks locating on the site.

On Oct. 26 village officials said the developer AG Westchester LLC needed more time because it’s taking a little longer to get tenant leases signed. The Village Board voted unanimously to extend the purchase and sale agreements by a few months.

UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzMwL3ViZXItcGF0ZW50LWRyaXZlci1yaXNrLWFsZ29yaXRobXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Patents Reveal Experiments With Predictive Algorithms to Identify Risky Drivers,"Safety issues have dogged Uber since its early days as a black car-hailing service. Car accidents and physical altercations have persisted despite Uber’s attempts to monitor its cars and vet drivers; reports of sexual violence in its vehicles eventually led Uber to admit it was “not immune” to the problem.

Amid public backlash and calls to address rider safety Uber rolled out a flashy “Safety First” initiative in 2018 adding features like 911 assistance to its app tightening screening of drivers and for the first time issuing a safety report that outlined traffic fatalities fatal physical assaults and sexual assaults on its platform.

That was before the pandemic. Over the past year and a half safety took on new significance; where it used to mean drivers had to make riders feel taken care of it now means that in addition to protecting riders from the virus drivers have to figure out how to keep themselves healthy.

And Uber again found itself persuading riders not to abandon its platform over safety fears — requiring drivers to submit a selfie verifying they’re wearing a mask offering limited amounts of cleaning supplies and asking riders to complete a safety check before getting into a vehicle.

While Uber’s changes might ease some riders’ concerns they don’t offer the same level of automation and scale that an algorithmic solution could. It’s a potential path hinted at by a series of Uber patents granted from 2019 to last summer which outline algorithmic scoring and risk prediction systems to help decide who is safe enough to drive for Uber.

Taken together they point to a pattern of experimentation with algorithmic prediction and driver surveillance in the name of rider safety. Similar to widely criticized algorithms that help price insurance and make decisions on bail sentencing and parole the systems described in the patents would make deeply consequential decisions using digital processes that are difficult or impossible to untangle. While Uber’s quest to make safety programmatic is tantalizing experts expressed concern that the systems could run afoul of their stated purpose.

An Uber spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that although the company is “always exploring ways that our technology can help improve the Uber experience” it does not currently have products tied to the safety scoring and risk assessment patents.

As the battle over drivers’ legal classification continues after Uber and Lyft used their deep pockets to fund an election victory that let them keep drivers as contractors in California there are urgent concerns that systems like these could become another means to remove drivers without due process especially as the pandemic has laid bare the vulnerability of gig workers who lack the safety net employees can lean on.

Watched at All Times

One patent for scoring driver safety risk relies on machine learning and rider feedback and notably suggests a driver’s “heavy accent” corresponds to “low quality” service.

Another aims to predict safety incidents using machine-learning models that determine the likelihood that a driver will be involved in dangerous driving or interpersonal conflict utilizing factors like psychometric tests to determine their “trustworthiness” monitoring their social media networks and using “official sources” like police reports to overcome biases in rider feedback.

“The mistake is that a driver loses their livelihood not that someone gets shown the wrong ad.”

Jeremy Gillula former tech projects director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who now works as a privacy engineer at Google said using algorithms to predict a person’s behavior for the purpose of “deciding if they’re going to be a danger or a problem” is deeply concerning.

“Some brilliant engineers realized we can do machine learning based on people’s text without realizing what we really want to get and what it actually represents in a real-life application” he said. “The mistake is that a driver loses their livelihood not that someone gets shown the wrong ad.”

Surveilling drivers under the guise of safety is a common thread in Uber’s patents. Many evaluate drivers’ performance using information from their phones including one that scores their driving ability and suggests tracking their eye and head movements with phone cameras and another that detects their behavioral state (angry intoxicated or sleepy) and assigns them an “abnormality score.”

Additional patents aim to monitor drivers’ behavior using in-vehicle cameras and approximate “distraction level” with an activity log that tracks what else they’re doing on their phones; making a call looking at a map or even moving the phone around could indicate distraction.

Jamie Williams a former staff attorney at EFF focused on civil liberties who now works as a product counselor said drivers should be aware they’re “being watched at all times.”

The patents also mirror technologies recently implemented by Amazon in its delivery vans. The company announced plans in February to install video cameras that use AI to track drivers’ hand movements driving abilities and facial expressions. Data collected by the cameras determines a “safety score” and could result in a driver being terminated. Drivers have told Reuters: “The cameras are just another way to control us.”

The Promise of Safety

The algorithm outlined in a 2019 safety risk scoring patent shows how dangerous these systems can be in real life experts said noting that it could mimic riders’ existing biases.

The system described in the patent uses a combination of rider feedback and phone metadata to assign drivers a safety score based on how carefully they drive (“vehicle operation”) and how they interact with passengers (“interpersonal behavior”). A driver’s safety score would be calculated once a rider submits a safety report to Uber.

After a report is submitted according to the patent it would be processed by algorithms along with any associated metadata including the driver’s Uber profile the trip duration distance traveled GPS location and car speed. With that information the report would be classified into topics like “physical altercation” or “aggressive driving.”

A driver’s overall safety score would be calculated using weighted risk assessment scores from the interpersonal behavior and vehicle operation categories. This overall score would determine if a driver has a low medium or high safety risk and consequently if they should face disciplinary action. Drivers with a high safety risk might receive a warning in the app a temporary account suspension or an unspecified “intervention” in real time.

Adding a further layer of automation the patent also describes a system that automatically tweaks driver safety scores based on specific metadata. A driver who has completed a certain number of trips would be marked as safer while one who has generated more safety incidents would be marked as less safe. According to the patent a driver who works at night is considered less safe than a driver who works during the day.

While this design may seem straightforward — shouldn’t a more experienced driver who has better road visibility be considered safer? — experts say any automated decision-making requires that developers make meaningful choices to avoid inserting bias into the entire system.

Gillula said Uber’s automated rules could make decisions based on flawed human assumptions. “Race may be correlated with what time of day you’re operating as an Uber driver. If it’s a second job because you have to work during the day it seems ridiculous to penalize you for that” he said. “This is exactly the sort of thing that worries me.”

If Uber wants to make its algorithmic scoring fair it would need to be transparent about how drivers are being evaluated and give them a proper feedback channel Williams said. “Machine learning algorithms can be wrong; users can be wrong” she said. “It’s very important to have clear processes transparency and awareness about what’s going into the score.”

Questions of Accuracy and Fairness

Risk assessment algorithms have long been used by insurance companies to set policyholder premiums based on indicators like age occupation geographical location and hobbies. Algorithms are also utilized in the criminal justice system where they’re applied at nearly every stage of the legal process to help judges and officials make decisions.

Proprietary algorithms like COMPAS used in states like Florida and Wisconsin determine an individual’s risk of recidivism on a scale of 1 to 10 with certain numbers corresponding to low medium and high risk — the same rubric Uber’s patent follows.

Though Uber aims to predict “safety” risk in its patents it faces the same fundamental questions of fairness and accuracy leveled at criminal justice algorithms. (The bias inherent in those algorithms has been pointed out again and again.) If the design of an algorithm is flawed from the outset its outcomes and predictions will be too. In the criminal justice context rearrest is an imperfect proxy for recidivism because arrests are so closely tied to factors like where you live whether you interact with the police and what you look like Gillula said.

Uber’s current rating system which allows riders and drivers to rate one another on a five-star scale is similar to the interpersonal behavior category described in Uber’s safety risk scoring patent: Both rely on subjective judgments that are the basis for doling out punishments. Under its current system Uber “deactivates” or fires drivers whose ratings drop below a certain threshold. The policy has long infuriated drivers who say they have no real way of contesting unfair ratings: They’re funneled through a support system that prioritizes passengers and rarely provides a satisfactory resolution.

Bhairavi Desai executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance said drivers are not protected from passengers’ racism bias or bigotry. “We’ve talked to drivers who feel like they’ve gotten a lower rating because they’re Muslim” she said. “I know of African American drivers who stopped working for them because they felt that they would be rated lower.”

Former driver Thomas Liu sued Uber last October proposing a class-action suit on behalf of nonwhite drivers who were fired based on racially “biased” ratings. Williams said the safety score would be subject to the same concerns: “People could put a safety report in just because they don’t like a driver. It could be racially biased and there could be a lot of misuse of it.”

Varinder Kumar a former New York City yellow cab driver was permanently deactivated by Uber in 2019. He’d been driving for Uber every day for nearly five years and the deactivation meant the sudden loss of $400 to $500 per week.

“You ask them what happened they always say it’s a safety issue.”

“I went to the office five times I emailed them and they said it was because one customer complained” Kumar said. “Whenever you go there you ask them what happened they always say it’s a safety issue. I’ve been driving in New York City since 1991 and had no accident no ticket so I don’t know what kind of safety they’re looking for.”

The kind of safety outlined in Uber’s safety risk scoring patent isn’t clear to Kumar either. He said the interpersonal behavior reporting would cause the same problems as Uber’s rating system: “Customers file a complaint even if they are not 100 percent right.” Meanwhile the vehicle operation category could unfairly penalize New York City drivers who need to drive more aggressively.

Joshua Welter an organizer with Teamsters 117 and the affiliated Drivers Union said algorithmic discipline remains a top issue for drivers. “It’s no wonder Uber and Lyft drivers across the country are rising up and taking action for greater fairness and a voice on the job like due process to appeal deactivations” Welter said. “It’s about basic respect and being treated as a human being not a data experiment.”

An Artificial Trust

The basis for Uber’s safety experimentation is user data and Daniel Kahn Gillmor a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech Privacy and Technology Project said Uber is “sitting on an ever-growing pile of information on people who have ever ridden on its platform.”

“This is a company that does massive experimentation and has shown little regard for data privacy” he added.

In addition to a vast trove of data gathered from over 10 billion trips Uber collects telematics data from drivers such as their car’s speed braking and acceleration using GPS data from their devices. In 2016 it launched a safety device called the Uber Beacon a color-changing orb that mounts to a car’s windshield. It was announced as a device that assisted with rider pickups without mention of the fact that it contained sensors for collecting telematics data. In a now-deleted blog post from 2018 Uber engineers touted the Beacon’s benefit as a device solely managed by Uber for testing algorithms and said it collected better data than drivers’ devices.

Brian Green director of technology ethics at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics questioned the motives behind Uber’s data collection. “If the purpose of [Uber’s] surveillance system is to promote trust — if a corporation wants to be trustworthy — they have to allow the public to look at them” he said. “A lot of tech companies are not transparent. They don’t want the light shone on them.”

Welter said that when companies like Uber experiment with worker discipline based on black box algorithms “both workers and consumers alike should be deeply concerned whether the reach of big data into our daily lives has gone too far.”

In addition to providing a view into Uber’s safety vision the patents demonstrate the scope of its machine learning ambitions.

“We’re dealing with so many people we don’t know that tech and surveillance steps in to build an artificial trust.”

Uber considers AI essential to its business and has made significant investments in it over the past few years. Its internal machine learning platform helps engineering teams apply AI to optimize trip routes match drivers and riders mine insights about drivers and build more safety features. Uber already uses algorithms to process over 90 percent of its rider feedback (the company said that it receives an immense amount of feedback by design the majority of which is not related to safety).

Algorithmic safety scoring and risk assessment also fit under Uber’s rider safety initiative and its efforts to ensure safe drop-offs for its growing delivery platform. Experts said the systems are not as far from reality as tech companies’ patents sometimes are. In a statement Uber said that “patent applications are filed on many ideas but not all of them actually become products or features.”

But some of Uber’s safety-related patents have close parallels with widely utilized features: A patent filed in 2015 for “trip anomaly” detection bears similarities to Uber’s RideCheck feature technology for anonymizing pickup and drop-off locations is similar to a patent application filed last year and an application filed in 2015 for verifying drivers’ identity with selfies is similar to Uber’s security selfie feature.

Green said Uber’s patents reflect a broader trend in which technology is used as a quick fix for deeper societal issues. “We’re dealing with so many people we don’t know that tech and surveillance steps in to build an artificial trust” he said.

That trust can only extend so far during the pandemic which has underscored the economic uncertainty drivers face and the limits of technology’s promise of safety. Rolling out such systems now would mean there’s even more at stake.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvMjAyMS9vY3QvMzAvYmxhY2stY2Ficy1yb2FyLWJhY2staW50by1mYXZvdXItYXMtYXBwLWZpcm1zLXB1dC11cC10aGVpci1wcmljZXPSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY2l0aWVzLzIwMjEvb2N0LzMwL2JsYWNrLWNhYnMtcm9hci1iYWNrLWludG8tZmF2b3VyLWFzLWFwcC1maXJtcy1wdXQtdXAtdGhlaXItcHJpY2Vz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black cabs roar back into favour as app firms put up their prices,"The young man was frantic trying to get to a third date with a woman he already knew he wanted to marry. But four Bolt drivers had let him down and when he tapped his Uber app it was asking for triple surge pricing. In desperation he did something he’d never done before – flagged down a black London taxi.

“He was trying to open the front door to get in. He wanted to give me a postcode – it was the usual thing you get from the ones who’ve never been in a cab before” said Karen Proctor a London taxi driver for more than a decade. “I told him ‘the postcode’s not going to help – just tell me where you want to get to’. It was a restaurant. And we got there seven minutes early at about a third of the cost. He was converted.”

Tales like that are why after nearly a decade of Uber-induced gloom things are looking up for cabbies. Trade has roared back into life since the end of Covid measures in July with many talking with some astonishment about their best-ever takings.

Gett the app which allows passengers to book black cabs and private hire cars says it is seeing 40% more rides each day for the traditional hail-and-ride cabs compared with the first quarter of 2020.

“It has been very busy – it feels like how it was before Uber came to the capital” Proctor said.

While foreign tourists are still mostly absent much of the demand during the summer came from British and Irish tourists taking advantage of discounted hotel rooms in the capital.

In other parts of the country trade is also coming back. Wendy Loveday the chair of the York Private Hire Association said: “It’s been like Christmas. It doesn’t matter which company you work for the work is there. And there are fewer Uber drivers because they’ve put up prices.”

A substantial portion of the new business is younger people who had grown to rely on Uber Bolt and other apps to get around London and other cities since they arrived in 2012.

But the cheap fares have gone – prices are up by about a third this year putting them on a par with taxis.

“Since late July it’s been absolutely incredible” said Angela Clarkson a jobbing cabby who is also the deputy general secretary of the United Cabbies Group. “The work levels have been off the scale for those lucky enough to have a cab.”

And there is the rub. While drivers with a cab talk of people running towards cabs when they stop to let out a passenger arguing about whose taxi it is or queues of 100 people outside Victoria train station or Liverpool city centre there are plenty of licensed drivers without a vehicle.

“People are coming to us every single day looking for a cab” said Lee DaCosta a founder of Cabvision which runs payment systems for taxis and also rents a fleet for drivers who don’t own a vehicle. “We’re having drivers turning up literally walking the streets from garage to garage going ‘got any cabs?’”

Transport for London (TfL) figures show there were 13858 licensed taxis in London on 24 October compared with historic levels of about 21000.

The rapid decline is partly due to Covid. During the pandemic when drivers had no prospect of earning money and some were ineligible for government support some were forced to sell their cabs and take up other jobs. It led to the sight of hundreds of cabs being stored in unused car parks and fields around London.

But some of the decline pre-dated the pandemic and DaCosta says TfL’s policy of forcing older diesel taxis off the road has not been accompanied by enough support for electric cabs.

A grant of up to £7500 for a new vehicle and up to £10000 for decommissioning an old one sounds generous but a new electric TX taxi costs about £60000 DaCosta said.

“Getting older polluting vehicles off the road is obviously a good thing” he said. “But the average age of a person in the industry is 54 and so you’re looking at about £50000 of finance. For someone in their 50s that’s not worth it.”

About 1200 drivers a year are leaving the trade DaCosta said but only about 300 a year are joining. There are only about 900 people doing the Knowledge – the requirement since 1865 for drivers to learn each street in a six-mile radius of Charing Cross which takes more than three years of training and practice before a licence is granted.

The driver shortage is not only affecting cabbies in London. Uber says it is back to pre-pandemic levels of drivers but needs more to meet increased demand with rides up by 40% in Nottingham 30% in Sheffield and 22% in Birmingham.

“A lot of drivers left the country to go back to their country of origin” said Matteo de Renzi the UK managing director of Gett. “There has been an exodus of drivers towards delivery platforms – Amazon has been very strong in that respect.”

Another reason why the scales have tipped away from Uber are a string of court cases which have sought to force the technology company to pay its drivers more. In February the supreme court ruled that Uber could not claim its drivers were self-employed and they should be entitled to minimum wage and paid holidays.

In the judgment Lord Leggatt said that Uber and other private hire operators were required to have a contract with their customers. That would mean they need to pay VAT – a bill of about £2bn – so the firm is challenging that element of the ruling in a court case on 23 November.

An Uber spokesperson said: “As the UK has opened up demand for Uber rides has soared with many cities now seeing demand 20-40% higher than it was before the pandemic. The number of drivers working on the app today is similar to before the pandemic however the growth in demand means that we need an additional 20000 drivers to get service levels back to normal.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzMwL3ViZXItbHlmdC1yaWRlcnNoaXAtZmFsbHMtMTUtaW4tbnljLXRheGktY2FiLXRyaXBzLXJpc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Lyft ridership falls 15% in NYC taxi cab trips rise,"The number of Uber and Lyft rides in New York City have declined 15 percent over the past few months — while yellow cabs picked up 5 percent more fares reversing a longtime trend.

New Yorkers took an average of 498641 Uber/Lyft daily rides in June but by September that figure slid to 432581 Taxi & Limousine Commission data shows.

Meanwhile yellow taxi trips rose from 94130 per day in June to 98724 over the same months.

New Yorkers once took about half a million taxi trips per day — until 2014 when Uber and Lyft began to eat away at taxi ridership.

Uber and Lyft executives have admitted that riders face higher fares and longer wait times than they’re used to — at least in part due to a shortage of drivers.

Yellow taxis on the other hand are not subject to mercurial “surge pricing.”

In New York “demand continues to outpace supply and prices and wait times remain above our comfort levels” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on the company’s most recent earnings call.

Lyft faces driver shortages as well CFO Brian Roberts said on its most recent earnings call — in part due to federal pandemic unemployment benefits.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- The I-Team is finding there is an effort to bring more cabs back on the road in Chicago and they could save you money if rideshares are ""surging.""

Taxi cabs are regulated by the city so the fares are ""surge"" proof. However if you can't get a cab on the street or if they aren't available on the apps like Curb then you're out of luck.

RELATED: Uber Lyft rides skyrocket in price as drivers remain scarce

In 2014 the I-Team reported that there were 6600 licensed cabs but in May of 2021 we reported there were 1480 -- and even that estimate is high according to one attorney who represents taxi cab drivers and their works with their union.

""So really the number of cabs you have operating the pickup passengers is maybe closer to 1000"" said attorney Furqan Mohammud with Mohammed Shamaileh & Tabahi LLC. ""Sometimes the drivers are just there. They're active because they're driving a little but they need that vehicle for their own personal use as well. So sometimes you have a scenario where it's cheaper for them to just keep their cab operating and work a little but they're not really driving full-time""

RELATED: Cab crash: Is Chicago's cab industry on the verge of collapse?

That attorney also says more cabs are coming back to fulfill transportation needs. The price of the average cab medallion was at around $350000 but that was before rideshare options. Now medallions sell for around $12000.

One driver we spoke to said he's seizing on the business opportunity. He paid $11000 for his and he's ready to get back to work.

""I was a cab driver over 10 years and then corona hits and everything stopped"" said taxi driver Adam Foudil. ""I'm not the only one coming back a lot of cab drivers are coming back so there's a huge need. Chicago is a big city and Uber and Lyfts aren't able to take the whole load so all the taxis now are coming back to take over you know again like it used to be.""

Cosmetics brands are turning to TV series from the 1990s and 2000s to attract the attention of millennials. That’s the finding of a new study from GlobalData which is based on the recent launches of several industry players in the run-up to Halloween a time of year when consumers often like to buy new makeup products. The data analytics platform tells us that younger consumers are the most likely to experiment with new skincare and makeup products with millennials leading the way (76%) ahead of Zers and those in generation X.

""The Simpsons"" and ""Saved by the Bell""

Millennials are likely the preferred target of cosmetic brands for these new fall launches. This is reinforced by the themes of the new collections namely some of the most emblematic series of the 1990s and 2000s thus accessing the nostalgia of an entire generation. Some examples include the ""Saved by the Bell"" collection from the brand Wet n Wild Beauty ""Gilmore Girls"" makeup from Ulta Beauty and a tribute to ""The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror"" the chilling Halloween episodes of the animated series by the brand Makeup Revolution.

According to GlobalData this marketing strategy is linked with ""retrophilia” and it corresponds to the current expectations of consumers. It can also be seen in the fashion industry the 1990s and 2000s have also made a remarkable comeback on the catwalks since the end of lockdowns with bootcut jeans visible underwear platform shoes and more testifying to the consumers’ enthusiasm for these two decades. The return of the 1990s supermodels — in particular Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss — on the catwalks of the four fashion capitals during the latest ready-to-wear shows is also noteworthy.

""In a society that highly values individuality film and TV-themed makeup taps into that deeply rooted emotion: nostalgia. We feel connected to characters - especially ones that we grew up watching - and having an opportunity to in some way be connected to those shows can be enjoyable. The makeup market is pretty oversaturated so using such pop culture-inspired themes could help a brand deliver a unique edge and help reach consumers that would not otherwise purchase"" explains Nina Nowak Senior Consumer Researcher at GlobalData.

The increasing influence of TV series

If cosmetic brands are currently tapping into the nostalgia chord it’s probably because TV shows are more than ever considered powerful fashion and beauty influencers. This was already the case in the 2000s with series like ""Sex and the City"" and ""Gossip Girl"" strongly inspired by the world of fashion but the phenomenon has been growing in recent years. ""Emily in Paris"" ""The Queen’s Gambit"" and ""Bridgerton"" are among the television series that have helped to bring certain pieces back to the forefront. Not to mention the success of ""Squid Game"" which has even managed to boost the search for vintage tracksuits.

""We are witnessing a grand return of the ’90s and early 2000s styles in fashion. As fashion and beauty coexist and influence each other retrophilia in the makeup category is a natural consequence. The key resonating point of such themed lines is allowing consumers to project a certain image — which is in line with the self-branding trend"" outlines Nina Nowak.

It remains to be seen whether this trend will continue after Halloween which is a good time to slip into the shoes of fictional characters who have left their mark not only in the form of a personal story but on a whole generation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXZlbnRpb24uY29tL2JlYXV0eS9za2luLWNhcmUvYTM4MDg5ODQwL2VhdS10aGVybWFsZS1hdmVuZS10aGVybWFsLXNwcmluZy13YXRlci1mYWNpYWwtbWlzdC1mb3ItY29sZC1tb250aHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Hydrating Facial Mist Dermatologists Love for Cold Weather,"We may earn commission from links on this page but we only recommend products we back.

The face mist can also help soothe stubborn patches caused by eczema according to a reviewer. “I was covered in dry red patches itched like there was a colony of ants under my skin and had given up my sanity” another reviewer wrote. “After I sprayed myself head to toe the itching was gone and my stubborn patches were 80% improved after about an hour.”

RFLCT came to public attention after Valkyrae became associated with the brand after what she quoted to be a two-years-long work.

Exclusive Partnership Between Hertz and United Airlines Ends Effective November 1 2021

…but that exclusive partnership officially terminates as of the stroke of midnight on Monday November 1 2021 — which is exactly seven years after it was launched — as indicated by the following message:

! Important Notice: You will no longer be able to enroll for this Hertz benefit after October 31 2021. Please Register by that date to receive Hertz Presidents Circle®status or Hertz Five Star® status valid through January 31 2023. Visit the FAQ page for details on this benefit.

The exclusive partnership meant that if you are a member of the MileagePlus frequent flier loyalty program you could only earn award miles with those three rental car partners.

Notice from other car rental companies who are now former partners with the United Airlines MileagePlus frequent flier loyalty program — such as from National Car Rental — was sent via e-mail message in as little as hours in advance prior to the time the exclusive partnership became effective catching some frequent travelers by surprise…

…and the announcement pertaining to the end of the exclusive partnership seems to be just as surprising and with short advance notice as well.

Details of the Exclusive Partnership — For One More Day

The MileagePlus frequent flier loyalty program miles you earn when renting vehicles from Hertz varies with the current elite level status which you have earned as follows:

1250 miles — MileagePlus Global Services Premier 1K and Premier Platinum members

— MileagePlus Global Services Premier 1K and Premier Platinum members 1000 miles — MileagePlus Premier Gold and Premier Silver members

— MileagePlus Premier Gold and Premier Silver members 750 miles — Primary card members of MileagePlus credit cards from Chase

— Primary card members of MileagePlus credit cards from Chase 500 miles — MileagePlus general members without any elite level status

Additionally you will still receive discounts when you book rental cars from Hertz through the official Internet web site of United Airlines — at least until through tomorrow Sunday October 31 2021.

Renting vehicles from Thrifty Car Rental and Dollar Rent A Car will still earn 50 MileagePlus frequent flier loyalty program miles per day for rentals of one to four days; or 500 MileagePlus frequent flier loyalty program miles for rentals five days or longer.

If you reserved your car rental before November 1 you will accrue the higher level of benefits available if you pick up your vehicle on or after November 1.

Additionally — effective as of Thursday January 1 2015 — MileagePlus Premier 1K and Premier Platinum elite level status members and primary MileagePlus Club and Presidential Plus Card members may sign up for complimentary Hertz President’s Circle elite level status in the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program with benefits which include:

Confirmed availability of standard-equipment economy through full-size four-door vehicles in the United States and Canada with a minimum 48-hour advance reservation; and

Confirmed one-car-class upgrade availability at all participating locations in the United States and Canada and select European locations

MileagePlus Premier Gold and Premier Silver elite level status members may sign up for complimentary Hertz Five Star status which includes one-car-class upgrades — based on availability.

If you already have earned one of the aforementioned elite status levels with the United Airlines MileagePlus frequent flier loyalty program — or you are a co-branded credit card holder — tomorrow Sunday October 31 2021 is the last day and your last chance when you can match your status to receive complimentary elite status with Hertz through Saturday December 31 2022.

Final Boarding Call

This announcement of the end of the exclusive partnership seems to have been handled as poorly as the announcement of the launch of the exclusive partnership from what I have seen as a member of both the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards frequent renter loyalty program and the United Airlines MileagePlus frequent flier loyalty program.

As I first reported in this article back on Wednesday August 28 2013 — which discusses whether lodging and car rental companies should form alliances similar to airlines — there are two other rental car companies in the United States…

Enterprise Holdings which owns the National Car Rental Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Alamo Rent a Car brands; and

Avis Budget Group which owns the Avis Car Rental Budget Rent a Car and Zipcar brands

…so could United Airlines eventually partner with one of those rental car companies? “However United teases that a new car partnership is coming soon” according to this article written by Matthew Klint of Live and Let’s Fly. “Premier members who have status matched will retain that status through 2022. A reason for the termination was not provided by either side nor is it clear what side initiated the termination or if it was mutual.”

Apparently the two companies experienced what is known as “the seven year itch” in which an exclusive relationship declines in quality after approximately seven years — and data which is included in this official article from July of 1981 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States seems to corroborate that theory...

United Parcel Service flight UPS-232 was travelling from East Midlands airport in the UK to Philadelphia in the US at the time. The scheduled cargo service had departed Cologne Germany earlier in the morning and made a planned stop at East Midlands.

The Boeing 747-440(F) jet with three crew on board had departed from East Midlands at around 5.20am and was about two hours into its journey when the crew requested permission to turn around and divert to Shannon Airport.

The crew had been in contact with air traffic controllers at the Irish Aviation Authority’s North Atlantic Communications Centre at Ballygirreen at the time.

The crew advised controllers they had “mechanical issue with some flight controls”. It’s understood the issue was associated with one of the jet’s hydraulic systems.

The jet was cleared to divert to Shannon while the crew confirmed to controllers there was not an emergency and board and they would not require assistance on arrival.

The flight landed at safely at 9.33am and taxied to the terminal building where ground crews and engineers were standing by.",,,,,,,,,

For the seventh time in the last nine seasons Toyota has won the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Manufacturer’s title. Toyota clinched the title a race before the conclusion of the 2021 season early on the strength of 14 in the first 21 events on the Truck Series schedule.

“The continued success of Toyota in the Truck Series is something we are very proud of” said Paul Doleshal Group Manager Motorsports and Assets Toyota Motor North America (TMNA). “We are excited to claim this title once again due to the hard work of our Tundra teams this season. Our veterans and young drivers have driven with poise and excellence and we look forward watching them continue to battle for the driver’s championship as we close out this season.”

Toyota drivers have been dominating this season. Kyle Busch Motorsports driver John Hunter Nemechek leads all drivers with five victories while team owner Busch has three wins of his own. ThorSport Racing’s Ben Rhodes drove to two wins at the start of the season – including Toyota’s 200th Truck Series victory at the Daytona International Speedway Road Course in February. Hattori Racing Enterprises’ Austin Hill also won two races in back-to-back fashion while Kyle Busch Motorsports rookie Chandler Smith and ThorSport Racing’s Christian Eckes both earned their first-career victories.

Since joining the series in 2004 Toyota has won 212 Truck Series races and captured 156 poles in 426 races. In addition to this year’s title Toyota also claimed manufacturer championships in 2006 (12 wins); 2007 (13 wins); 2008 (13 wins); 2009 (14 wins); 2010 (15 wins); 2013 (13 wins); 2014 (18 wins) 2015 (14 wins) 2016 (14 wins) 2017 (12 wins) and 2019 (12 wins).

Zane Smith emerged victorious after a bare-knuckled overtime finish with Matt Crafton and John Hunter Nemechek filing into the title race after an eventful afternoon in the United Rentals 200. Ben Rhodes did his best to stay above the conflict maintaining fender neutrality to make the Championship 4 while many more of his competitors bickered about their lot on pit road afterward.

Those four will run for the Camping World Trucks title next Friday (8 p.m. ET FS1 MRN SiriusXM) at Phoenix Raceway in the Lucas Oil 150. Last year’s champ Sheldon Creed Stewart Friesen Chandler Smith and Carson Hocevar were eliminated.

Nemechek was among those with the most to argue about afterward. A run-in with non-playoff driver Austin Wayne Self left the Kyle Busch Motorsports driver on the receiving end of a retaliatory bump and his No. 4 Toyota sustained terminal damage ending his day 75 laps from the finish.

“He shouldn‘t be out here if he‘s just going to hook someone in the right rear and turn them in the fence” Nemechek said after a quick stop at the infield care center. “NASCAR should definitely look at that. It‘s playoff contention. You‘ve got to have respect and he doesn‘t.”

RELATED: John Hunter Nemechek’s day ends early | Nemechek: Self has no respect

Self offered his own explanation after exiting his No. 22 Chevrolet.

“I have no idea. I was turning in the corner and it’s just Martinsville — main thing whatever” Self said. “Everybody’s fighting for the same real estate. I didn’t know who it was when I turned in so it wasn’t anything against anybody. I guess bad judgment call on my part. At the end of the day I’m racing for the same thing here at Martinsville. He could’ve been a little more conservative maybe but I had no idea who it was so it’s not like I turned left on purpose just to wreck him personally. Could’ve been anybody inside me there.”

Nemechek said he paced for the remainder of the race inside the No. 4 hauler to await his playoff fate. He entered the Round of 8 finale atop the standings with a 36-point cushion. He finished 39th and made the cut by just four points — “a little bit too close for comfort” Nemechek said.

“I’m just glad that we advanced” Nemechek said. “My motto coming into this was ‘survive and advance.’ We didn’t survive but we advanced so that’s good.”

Crafton will drive for his fourth series championship at Phoenix but was in a fighting mood after Martinsville. He faced off with Creed on pit road in an attempt to explain his side of a crash with 16 laps remaining in regulation a scrap worsened by a bump from Crafton’s fellow ThorSport Racing driver Grant Enfinger who he berated as “my worthless teammate.”

Despite all the jostling Crafton finished fifth and advanced by the same four-point margin that sent Nemechek through. In redoubling his focus for the title race Crafton also suggested that a form of frontier justice may be needed to restore some respect to the series’ spirit of competition.

“Yeah whip somebody’s ass after they wreck you” Crafton said. “At the end of the day don’t just talk about it do something about it. That’s my motto. These guys work too hard sponsors pay too much money just to get wrecked and show no class like that. So just bust somebody in the mouth and it’ll fix it I think.”

Zane Smith forced his own way into the final mix from a starting spot inside the second row for the overtime restart. He forced the issue with a bold three-wide move that ultimately paid off finally avoiding Friesen’s contact with late-race leader Todd Gilliland and ending a daylong contest of tempers and bumpers. “I got flipped off on Lap 2” he said. “That’s probably a new record for me.”

Rhodes wound up sitting the prettiest of all logging a relatively uneventful seventh-place result and keeping his No. 99 ThorSport team out of the warring factions on pit road post-race.

RELATED: Ben Rhodes reflects on locking in title shot spot

“I was putting more energy into avoiding the wrecks than the energy I was putting into chasing the clock” Rhodes said referring to the track’s traditional grandfather clock trophy for the race winner. “I knew if I’m chasing the clock I’m going to be a target. … We did everything right. I just after I saw what happened to John Hunter I hated it for him because I saw his season going down the drain for nothing. So I was like I really don’t want to be that guy. We’re good on points right now. Let’s just chill out. We don’t need to put ourselves in a pissing match with nobody and get wrecked. That was the plan and we followed it and stayed true to it.

“Stayed patient and we let people go when they wanted to beat our bumper off or said they wanted to wreck us and it paid off. So we’re making it to Phoenix and avoided the carnage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9yYWNpbmcvbmFzY2FyL2EzODExNDU0OC96YW5lLXNtaXRoLXN1cnByaXNlcy1uYXNjYXItdHJ1Y2tzLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zane Smith Surprises Field Wins Way Into NASCAR Camping World Trucks Championship 4,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autoweek.com/racing/nascar/a38114548/zane-smith-surprises-nascar-trucks-championship/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9yYWNpbmcvbmFzY2FyL2EzODExNDU0OC96YW5lLXNtaXRoLXN1cnByaXNlcy1uYXNjYXItdHJ1Y2tzLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Transcript

Health systems and hospitals have obviously been thinking about cybersecurity for years now: how can they ensure they are staying ahead of threats?

Well healthcare systems really need to work on a shorter strategy. Somewhere in the area of one to two years versus the historical three years. Information security is changing too much. The threats are changing and evolving. So you really need to focus on what's present and what's current. And the tools that are actually coming out really need to be focused on some of the other areas concern [like] really security operations. While we're all comfortable with information security and how it's running those plans procedures and policies really need to be looked at to make sure they're up to date and continue into the future with different regulations or different changes.

New tools that are coming out also have different synergies and interconnected components where you can actually have a toolset that all work together for a better cost. Really understanding the data that you have. Healthcare systems are known for unstructured data legacy data new data. It's really hard and difficult sometimes to find out who needs access to what and healthcare systems leaves that open. So really finding those out and finding the identities that really need to access that data is important. And then classification of that data for security purposes is really understanding who has access and what level of access they need. Is that data really secure or not?

Trending analysis right? Looking at the trends that are happening in the industry looking at what's happening on a landscape the threat landscape and then adapting to it really as it happens is something really important that healthcare systems cybersecurity professionals need to do. Within healthcare what I've seen also is partnership. You really need to partner with business units such as risk legal compliance and really get everyone on the same page.

Security is historically seen as kind of the wall right? It's a hurdle it's always an inefficiency. But now security is seen as something that can protect the organization from extended downtimes right? We've seen a downtimes in this industry longer than we've ever seen before. So you really need to protect yourself to be resilient against it.

And then emerging threats is really sharing data right? So knowledge sharing information security is really important to share what you see and then attach and connect to other sharing networks that share that information with you. So you can find that data or find the threat or find the vulnerability before it's really attacked or leveraged in the wild. And then also probably now more than ever is third-party. Third-party assessments and third-party partners is a vector where you see now they're going after the partner or the vendor or manufacturer to really attack them which in turn impacts your business.

What are the biggest threats or weak points that are vulnerable?

Honestly I think the biggest weak point and/or the biggest threat right of right now is really the increased amount of phishing attacks that are targeted to healthcare systems. Just our organization alone we receive 50 million emails a year on average and we only allow 4 million in. That's a huge vast number of what emails are actually identified as malicious. And those are just increasing as we go through. And that's really a big threat in the industry because that's the entry point for a lot of issues within cybersecurity right? So talking about ransomware and all these bad malware and viruses that can happen phishing is one of the biggest vectors.

Another area is really understanding like I mentioned before is identity. Who's accessing the data? So right now there's a big push for identity management where you really understand the individual and you identify and put a profile around that user where the user can only access certain things in the organization and nothing else right? Locking it down to specific targeted appliances or systems. And then on the same vein with identity is really passwords right? So the biggest weak point in healthcare is we have doctors we have nurses that don't want to use strong passwords. And it's an impact to their operations because they have to type it a lot. So really leveraging products like badge swiping you know tap-and-go type of systems and then also using changes with your passwords using password list checks where you check for previously pawned or previously breached passwords. Right now there's a publicly available database of over 600 million passwords where they're well known. You should not allow your healthcare individual's staff to use those passwords. Right? It's an easy it's an easy win.

Those are those are some of the I think the biggest threats I'm seeing. And then one other is really back to third party. We don't know what they're doing all the time right? It's a third party. You're putting your trust into another organization.

Speaking during the ""Towards Comprehensive Health Coverage in Jordan"" conference Hawari noted that His Majesty King Abdullahin the Letter of Designation to Prime Minister Al Bisher Al Khasawneh's government directed it to expand the base of subscribers to the health insurance programme.

The event is organised by the Jordan Association for Medical Insurance (JAMI) in cooperation with stakeholders the Jordan News Agency Petra reported.

Hawari said that the government provides free health coverage to any patient suffering from a disease with a high treatment cost primarily cancer kidney failure and chronic blood diseases.

He noted that Jordan over the past few years covered nearly 650000 children under free health insurance adding that the Kingdom also provided coverage to citizens over 60 years old.

Former prime minister Omar Razzaz said that the journey towards comprehensive health insurance coverage in Jordan started decades ago referring to efforts exerted in this field but not completed.

Former health minister Saad Jaber said that Jordan spends 8.2 per cent of the gross domestic product on health which is a ""high percentage"" noting that the government will subsidise health insurance subscriptions according to the monthly incomes of households.

In this regard Jaber said that the Health Ministry annually spends some JD2.5 billion to provide ""distinguished"" health services to citizens.

JAMI President Fawaz Ajlouni highlighted the importance of creating a fair and sustainable health system to address all health threats that the Jordanian society suffers from.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC9maW5sYW5kLXB1YmxpYy11bml2ZXJzYWwtY2hpbGRjYXJlLWRheS1jYXJlLWVhcmx5LWVkdWNhdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finland's Public Childcare System Puts the Rest of the World to Shame,"The autumn is a colorful time in Finland. The trees turn yellow and then red before the leaves fall. Neon pinks and yellows also appear — the reflective vests of toddlers and children venturing out to explore parks and cities with their day care teachers.

In Finland these sights are omnipresent. The country’s free or inexpensive public and private day care is in many suburbs so extensive that it seems every block might well have one. This autumn my eighteen-month-old daughter has started in hers — a city-run public day care quite close to our home.

There for a part of the day she will join a group of twelve equally small kids while her parents go to work or study. Among other activities she plays with friends goes on nature trips and visits the library.

Day care is a place for children not only to engage in play get nutritious meals and improve their immune systems but also to prepare for education and for wider society. The children are cared for by skilled caretakers too — like schoolteachers early childhood education teachers in Finland have generally been university-educated since 1995.

Of course the idea of day care for children existed before then — it’s existed for as long as people have opted to care for each other’s children to free the others to do work. The first kindergarten in Finland intended for children of workers in the working-class suburbs of Helsinki and subsidized by corporations was established as early as 1888; four years later the education for kindergarten teachers began. Finland then an autonomous part of Russian Empire was the first Nordic country to introduce it.

Municipalities were permitted to establish day cares in 1919 but at first only a few chose to do so. Only since the postwar period has day care been formalized as a crucial aspect of the welfare state. The current form of the Finnish day care system dates to 1973 when the government passed the Act on Children’s Day Care mandating municipalities to offer sufficient day care to meet the local need. This was step by step expanded to the so-called subjective right to day care the requirement to organize a day care spot for every child in need of one no matter their parents’ economic situation — a cornerstone of the Finnish system ever since.

This process was always aided by the efforts of cross-party MPs particularly women. In more recent times though the subjective right has come under fire especially from the Right as it includes cases in which one parent stays at home — for example due to unemployment. The fact that parents may stay at home while recovering from mental health issues for instance was overlooked.

This criticism led to the subjective right being temporarily limited as a national mandate by a center-right government in 2018 although many municipalities chose to keep it; the current center-left government has since restored it though taking the multiplicity of situations in which parents may stay home into account.

At present then every Finnish parent if they so wish may put their under-school-age children into day care; the municipalities are required to find a place for every one of them. This is not always an easy task especially considering the importance of keeping day care spots close at home — not every suburb is as well-served as ours. In practice queue systems are often used for the most popular locations.

In the 1970s the main function of day care was freeing parents chiefly women to become a part of the labor force. However in later decades the pedagogical function of day care has moved to the fore with day care often considered a crucial step for preparing children for school and studies. The last year of day care generally functions as a preschool.

In fact the preferred term for the whole institution is not “day care” but “early childhood education” and the Act of Early Childhood Education in 2015 codified this pedagogical transformation. This educational element is supported by the government’s commitment to keeping day care well funded — the aim is one adult for every four children at Finnish day cares the lowest ratio of all OECD countries.

Like many other institutions of the welfare state day cares have had to face the challenge of the COVID pandemic and at times this goal has been missed. But the commitment to proper funding remains and as a rule the state has kept children’s activities — day cares and schools — as open and normal as possible instead aiming restrictions at adults.

Crucially day care is not the only option provided by the Finnish state to parents. Parents who wish to keep their little ones at home can quite easily do so bolstered by a home care subsidy — a few hundred euros from the state per month often with extra municipal subsidies. In the past this subsidy has sometimes been criticized as a measure that keeps women at home but many parents see it instead as an extension of free choice allowing them to find an option that works according to their personal situation.

Many families will end up choosing to utilize day care at some times and to keep the children home at others. Another option is family-based day care which sees children cared for by a trained worker in their own homes or in someone else’s home instead of in a day care facility. Whatever choice families make they can partake in the holistic network of institutions making up the Nordic welfare state.

This welfare state allows for variety in the specifics. Political parties and families debate the best approaches to implementation and use; some for example disagree on how young kids should be when they start day care.

Nevertheless at some point all parents — no matter their ideology or views on childcare — will have an option available. Conservative liberal and socialist parents send their kids to the same day cares confident they will be cared for and given the opportunity to learn new things. The day care does not intend to replace the family; it complements its efforts and works hand in hand with it.

This is proof that the welfare state and society and culture do not work against each other; rather they work in tandem. Like so many other parts of the welfare state day care provision is today a cause for all parties not just those on the Left. It has in a word become normal.

Like my child I went to a day care myself in the 1980s. Other day care attendees today will have not only parents but grandparents who also went to day care. All of us have benefitted from this universal day care provision — and so will future generations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXRlY29hdGludmVzdG9yLmNvbS93YXNoaW5ndG9uLWxvbmctdGVybS1jYXJlLWluc3VyYW5jZS1sYXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Long Term Care Insurance - Washington State's New Law | White Coat Investor,"By Dr. James M. Dahle WCI Founder

One of the worst pieces of legislation I have ever seen was passed in 2019 by the Washington state legislature and signed into law by Gov. Jay Inslee. The law forces every resident of Washington to EITHER buy Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) OR pay a payroll tax of 0.58% on earned income. The deadline for this law (Jan. 1 2022) is rapidly approaching and the deadline for opting out is already here (Nov. 1 2021). Predictably this law has had a ton of unintended consequences not the least of which is the fact that you haven't been able to buy LTCI in the great state of Washington for months. To make matters worse other states are reportedly considering similar laws.

Why Did Washington Pass the Law Requiring Long-Term Care Insurance?

The law started with good intentions. Lawmakers realized that lots of people need Long-Term Care (LTC) and very few people can actually afford it. The vast majority of people who need LTC pay for it through the Medicaid program which for those who are not aware is a jointly funded program between the federal government and state governments. In Washington state the federal government currently pays for 88% of it and the state pays for 12% of it. The idea behind this new law was to save $3.9 billion over 30 years in state Medicaid costs although it is unclear to me how much of that “saved” $3.9 billion was supposed to come from money raised from this new tax and how much of it was supposed to come from people not needing Medicaid to pay for their LTC because they bought insurance to avoid paying the tax.

The tax was coupled with a new program that provides a lifetime benefit of up to $36500 in “home healthcare and an array of services related to long-term healthcare including equipment transportation and meal assistance.”

The Washington Cares Act Fund Director Ben Veghte says “Long-term care insurance has been around for four decades and they’ve never managed to cover more than 7% of the population. That’s never proved to be an affordable product for the middle class.”

Well that's true. LTC is really expensive. So the LTCI that pays for it is going to be really expensive too. Since the median American household has an income of around $60000 per year and the median 50-year-old has retirement savings of something like $150000 Veghte is right. People can't afford LTC or LTCI. Apparently the state government doesn't like the federal government's solution to this program (Medicaid) and thinks its program is better. I'm not really convinced.

Although the purpose of this post is not necessarily to criticize the Washington program itself (more the way the funding for the program has been rolled out) it has quite a few hoops to jump through in order to qualify.

Eligibility Requirements for Washington Care Act Benefits:

First despite paying the tax starting in 2022 you don't actually qualify for benefits for 10 more years. That's right. You're paying the taxes but you're not getting any sort of insurance benefit for doing so for the first decade.

Second you have to work at least 500 hours per year to get credit.

Third you can't stop working for more than five years total or three of the last six years and still get your benefit. Even if you've already paid in for 10+ years!

Fourth if you're close to retirement you get a little break but only if you claim the benefit within three years of stopping working.

Fifth a private nursing home room in Washington costs $11000 a month but this program only covers $3000 a month.

Sixth if you work in Washington but live in Oregon or Idaho you still have to pay the tax. But you can't have the benefit. Also if you live in Washington now but then retire to another state you can't have the benefit. Sorry.

The only exclusions are federal employees (I guess because the feds have an LTCI-like benefit) and people that have LTCI purchased prior to November 1 2021.

You can't make this stuff up.

How White Coat Investors Deal with LTC Costs

For years Americans have dealt with LTC costs in the following ways:

#1 Hope and pray you never need LTC and

#2 If you do end up needing LTC choose how to take care of that based on your wealth and marital status:

If unmarried spend down (paying for LTC) to Medicaid levels and then have Medicaid pay after that If married but with wealth less than $200000-$500000 spend down to Medicaid levels If married with wealth of perhaps $200000 to $1.2 million-$2 million buy LTCI If married with wealth > $1.2 million-$2 million self-insure against this risk

Over the years I've hoped that most white coat investors would find themselves in that fourth category by their 50s the time when most people consider buying LTCI. Essentially the only WCIers I've recommended LTCI to are those in the “donut hole” who don't want to impoverish their surviving spouse due to their LTC costs. Beyond this issue of whether to self-insure LTCI has never really been ready for primetime. In the beginning companies charged too little and then went out of business before the people who bought their policies ever needed them. These days the policy premiums are likely to be raised to unaffordable amounts before you need the benefits. It's just a really problematic area of the insurance world.

Buy Insurance or Opt-Out and Pay the Tax?

So what's the issue? Government is always coming up with new programs and of course those programs have to be funded. How else would they be funded besides a new tax? The issue was this ability to opt-out of the tax caused a lot of high earners to buy insurance products they would otherwise not purchase. At a certain level of income it's cheaper to buy LTCI than it is to pay the tax. Consider a couple making $800000 per year.

$800000 x 0.58% = $4640

That's a lot of money. How much does LTCI cost? Well let's first figure out what kind of policy qualifies for the exemption. Per the law itself:

“(5) ‘Long-term care insurance' means an insurance policy contract or rider that is advertised marketed offered or designed to provide coverage for at least twelve consecutive months for a covered person. Long-term care insurance may be on an expense incurred indemnity prepaid or other basis for one or more necessary or medically necessary diagnostic preventive therapeutic rehabilitative maintenance or personal care services provided in a setting other than an acute care unit of a hospital. Long-term care insurance includes any policy contract or rider that provides for payment of benefits based upon cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity. (a) Long-term care insurance includes group and individual annuities and life insurance policies or riders that provide directly or supplement long-term care insurance. However long-term care insurance does not include life insurance policies that: (i) accelerate the death benefit specifically for one or more of the qualifying events of terminal illness medical conditions requiring extraordinary medical intervention or permanent institutional confinement; (ii) provide the option of a lump sum payment for those benefits; and (iii) do not condition the benefits or the eligibility for the benefits upon the receipt of long-term care. (b) Long-term care insurance also includes qualified long-term care insurance contracts. (c) Long-term care insurance does not include any insurance policy contract or rider that is offered primarily to provide coverage for basic Medicare supplement basic hospital expense basic medical-surgical expense hospital confinement indemnity major medical expense disability income related income asset protection accident only specified disease specified accident or limited benefit health . . . (8) “Qualified long-term care insurance contract” or “federally tax-qualified long-term care insurance contract” means: (a) An individual or group insurance contract that meets the requirements of section 7702B(b) of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended; or (b) The portion of a life insurance contract that provides long-term care insurance coverage by rider or as part of the contract and that satisfies the requirements of sections 7702B(b) and (e) of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended.”

If you go to Section 7702B(b) of the internal revenue code you find that the policy must pay a benefit of $175 per day or $63875 per year.

Per the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance average policy costs in 2020 were:

So this theoretical couple making $800000 is actually better off buying insurance ($3050 premium < $4640 tax) than they are paying the tax. Not only do they pay less overall but they theoretically get the benefit of having some (admittedly unnecessary) insurance to boot! Easy decision (assuming you can actually get LTC insurance that is).

However since most people make less than $800000 they are faced with a dilemma. Do I pay the tax or do I buy insurance? If you are a single healthy 65-year-old man with an income of $100000 you can get insurance for $1400 a year or you can pay a tax of $580 a year. Which is better? Much harder to say.

It gets even more confusing when the insurance agents start getting involved. You see you don't have to buy LTCI to avoid the tax. You can also buy a life insurance policy with an LTC rider or even an annuity with an LTC rider.

Lovely. My three least-favorite insurance products all combined together. I would hope that the vast majority of white coat investors could avoid all three of them. Now you see why I hate this piece of legislation. If you want to pay for a new social program just raise the darn taxes. Don't combine your new tax with some sort of boon to the sleaziest part of the financial services industry and force people into all kinds of weird financial dilemmas.

Unintended Consequences of the Washington State LTC Program

Naturally Washingtonians rushed to buy long-term care insurance. The state program clearly wasn't very good so they might as well get some better insurance instead of paying that tax. Insurance carriers saw the number of applications go up by 48X. I don't know about your business but no business I have ever been associated with could handle that sort of sudden increase in demand especially if it just going to be a short-term bump. However Forbes columnist Howard Gleckman hypothesized that the insurance companies pulled out of the market for two other reasons:

#1 The purchasers were way too enthusiastic. They feared the risk pool would worsen since those who buy LTCI are typically those most likely to need it.

#2 Insurance companies were worried (with good reason) that Washingtonians would just purchase a policy to opt-out of the state plan and then cancel their coverage once they officially received their LTCI exemption (duh of course they're going to do that if the state allows it). That would be bad for the companies since they would not be getting ongoing premiums and potentially bad for the Washingtonians who would have neither a private LTC policy nor the backstop of the public program. The only winners? You guessed it! The agents selling the insurance products and pocketing the commissions.

So the companies started telling the brokers they would have to pay back the commission if the policy was canceled in less than a year. Voila! The companies don't want to sell it. The brokers don't want to sell it. And for months nobody has been able to buy it—even people who would have bought it without this goofy law being put in place. The legislature just put the kibosh on an entire industry. #unintendedconsequences

Long-Term Care Insurance Substitutes

So Washingtonians could no longer buy LTCI and have not been able to for months. So where do people turn? That's right entirely different insurance products they would have never considered if not for this law. Some universal life insurance policies have a long-term care rider attached to them. A single premium policy averages $75000. So for $75000 or so you have a policy and it has a long-term care rider that allows you to get out of the tax. NerdWallet uses the following example:

“Combination policies differ but here’s a hypothetical example for a MoneyGuard II policy from Lincoln Financial: a 60-year-old female nonsmoker pays a single $100000 premium for up to $453783 in long-term care benefits or about 4.5 times the premium. Long-term care benefits could pay out for up to six years at up to $6303 per month. If she never used the policy for long-term care it would pay a death benefit of $151261 to her beneficiary. And after year 5 she could get her $100000 back if she didn’t want the policy any longer and hadn’t used any of the long-term care benefits.”

Pretty hard to get excited about that but is it surprising that agents can use fear of this tax to sell policies like this? Their sales pitch goes like this “Well you'll get out of the tax and save a few thousand a year. If you need LTC this will pay for it at least for a while and if you don't you can leave the death benefit to your kids as an inheritance.” I think most wealthy people looking at that proposition would say “Well I can buy this policy cancel it in five years and only lose the earnings on my $100000 (maybe $50000) and never pay the tax at least until the Legislature catches on.” Honestly I think most WCIers would still just pay the tax. Note that accelerated death benefit riders and critical illness benefit riders do not count with Washington.

The other option is to purchase an annuity with a long-term care rider. Some people like that option because like single premium life insurance it's one lump sum and you're done. No ongoing LTCI premiums. It might be an especially nice option if you could buy a tiny little annuity and qualify to opt-out of the tax. I spoke with one agent in Washington who said he had heard people were buying annuities as small as $35000 and qualifying but his company didn't sell them. He also told me that not long after LTC policies became unavailable so did life policies and annuities with LTC riders. No surprise I suppose.

Can You Really Cancel Your LTC Policy?

It seems that you can (there is no penalty for doing so in the law) but that tactic would really only work until you change jobs. Each new employer will ask for proof of LTCI when they are doing your onboarding paperwork. If you don't have it they'll withhold the tax from your paychecks.

What Should You Do About the Washington Cares Fund If You Live There?

At this point it's too late to buy an LTC policy a life insurance policy or even an annuity and then cancel it in a few months. The deadline is Nov. 1 2021. I think the law is absolutely ridiculous that it even allows you to opt-out of a tax permanently by owning a policy for just a few months anyway. I suspect the law will be modified in the future eliminating that option but who knows.

I think the best perspective to take here is that this is just another tax. It's a payroll tax so it goes away when you stop working and it does not apply to anything but earned income. It might make an S Corp a little more attractive than it otherwise would be but Congress is in the process right now of making S Corps dramatically less attractive in every state by eliminating their primary benefit.

While I encourage you to write your state legislators at this point I think you should just pay your tax and feel good about your tax dollars perhaps eventually helping out a few of your fellow Washington residents with their long-term care costs. Maybe someday you might even see a little benefit from the program yourself.

If you are in another state and this happens in your state and you want to opt-out do it as soon as the law passes. When the masses find out about the opt-out option the insurers will probably stop selling policies relatively quickly. Hopefully other states learn from Washington's mistake and either choose not to allow an opt-out or simply do not pass the law at all.

What do you think? If you are in Washington what did you choose to do? Did your practice put a group LTCI policy in place? Did you buy a policy yourself? Did you buy a life insurance policy or annuity with a rider? Are you just planning to pay the tax?

The equipment will help improve access to quality health services and strengthen the network of care within the Primary Health Care System in the Upper West Upper East Northern North-East and Savanna regions.

They include; Pulse oximeters Glucometres Haemoglobin meters and their respective strips BP apparatus Stethoscope Weighing and Height scales Dressing instrument set Sterilizing drums Veronica buckets and Vaccine carriers.

Mr Araki Yasumichi the Chief Representative of JICA Ghana Office said the donation followed a request made by the GHS through the “Strengthening community-based health services focusing on the life course approach (CHPS for Life) project in the Northern regions.”

He said the five-year CHPS for Life project which commenced in June 2017 and is likely to end in June 2022 leveraged the well-established community health systems to promote access to quality health care for all age cohorts.

“It also focuses on building the capacity of health professionals at the CHPS Health centre and district hospital level to promote a healthy lifestyle social behaviour change early detection and prompt referral of high-risk conditions including Non-Communicable Diseases and other diseases of public health interest” he said.

Mr Yasumichi acknowledged the strong collaboration between the Ministry of Health (MOH) GHS and JICA which had led to many impactful interventions such as improving geographical accessibility through the CHPS strategy and addressing maternal and newborn care issues.

He stressed that in line with JICA’s Initiative for Global Health and Medicine the medical equipment would ensure continuity in the provision of essential health services and strengthen the preparedness for the pandemic including the COVID -19 pandemic.

The Director-General of GHS Dr Patrick Kuma Aboagye who received the medical equipment thanked JICA for its contribution to strengthening health systems in Ghana.

He said the equipment would be given to over 1000 functional CHPS zones in 52 selected districts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYW5hYnVzaW5lc3NuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzMwL2luZm9ybWFsLXBhdGllbnQtb3V0LW9mLXBvY2tldC1wYXltZW50cy1leGlzdC1pbi1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1zeXN0ZW0tdWhhcy1yZXNlYXJjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Informal patient out-of-pocket payments exist in health care system - UHAS Research,"Research by a nine-member team of the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) in collaboration with the Ghana Health Service (GHS) has revealed that informal and out-of-pocket patient payments existed within the formal health care system.

The Team said the payments were usually to obtain better attention care or to avoid delay at the health facility.

It showed that the payments disproportionately favoured only those who had the capacity or ability to pay for services to the disadvantage of the relatively poorer elderly people.

Dr Martin Ayanore of UHAS and Principal Investigator of the Research addressing participants during a virtual dissemination workshop said the factors that determined the payments at health facilities were largely individual and household driven.

The findings were from a recently ended study titled: “Informal patient payments within the formal health system among older persons (60+ years) in three health facilities in the Volta Region: Policy implications for health care financing and geriatric care.”

The project funded by the University of Health and Allied Sciences formed part of the University’s mandate to disseminate knowledge and the results of research and their applications to the needs and aspirations of the people.

The two-year research was conducted in three sites in the Volta Region; namely Hohoe and Ho Municipals and Keta District.

Dr Ayanore said a significant proportion of the elderly could not make informal payments as a result of their present financial circumstances.

He said the proportion of informal payments for in-patient care was higher relative to out-patient care services received by the elderly in the study settings.

He said although the ability to offer informal patient payments was low there was a high willingness to pay expression by respondents.

The Principal Investigator said specific services drugs and disease conditions not covered under health insurance delays in reimbursing facilities need to keep services running and lack of well-developed policy on out-of-pocket payments were reasons for the practice.

He noted that informal patient payments also existed because of personal gains of some health workers shortage of essential medicines which created opportunities for some health staff to seek them to clients and the government’s non-payment of utility bills which forced managers to find alternative ways to settle expenses.

Dr Ayanore noted that the charging of user fees poverty among the elderly hindering payment of renewal fees unclear message about the National Health Insurance Scheme and the aged not being aware of their cards being missing or expired were challenges with the implementation of the “Exemption Policy.”

He said effects of the payments on service utilisation and Universal Health Coverage (UHC) include disruption of the medication and care continuum of the elderly due to constant demand for out-of-pocket payments and weakening of health behaviour among the elderly.

Dr Ayanore said it also led to high health expenditure retard progress towards UHC and lead to health inequity because quality health care only went in favour of those who could pay for all the services.

He said the present problem required urgent policy action to protect economically vulnerable older people from financial catastrophe and contribute to UHC in Ghana.

The Principal Investigator recommended the reorientation of the current health care financial model at the national level in line with the attainment of UHC.

Dr Ayanore tasked the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service to work towards regular restocking of pharmacies and dispensaries to prevent shortages that led to unauthorised selling of essential drugs by some health workers in exchange for informal cash payments.

He also called for public education regarding official user fees and health insurance in an appealing and understandable form especially for the elderly and less educated.

Concerning knowledge attitudes and perceptions regarding informal payments most respondents had a positive attitude towards informal payments while most also did not know where to complain.

Most respondents also strongly disagreed that informal payments were similar to corruption but gifts to express gratitude.

Madam Josephine Asante a representative from the Ghana Health Service (GHS) participating in the meeting revealed that there was a Department within the Family Health Division of the GHS with a National Coordinator who coordinated affairs of the geriatrics.

She said there were proposals to develop guidelines that would help the Department to enhance its work.

Mr Fidelis Anumu Research Operations Office Institute of Health Research UHAS noted that the conduct of research was a key element of the vision of the University.

He said the research fund was to build the capacity of faculty build capacity in research grants management and also build capacity in the ability to respond to calls for proposals and in submitting applications for international competitive grants.

Mr Anumu said a total of GH¢418523.32 worth of grants were awarded to 25 senior members of the University for various research projects.

Participants invited for the workshop included representatives from District and the Regional Health Directorates elderly persons from Hohoe Ho and Keta groups from the academia district representative from the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) Civil Society Organisation and NGOs in Health members of the academic community Ghana Health Service (National) and the media.

The win sends Madrid back to the top of La Liga at least for a few hours with Sevilla Real Betis and more realistically Real Sociedad able to overtake them later this weekend.

“We were very practical” said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti. “After only two days rest it’s not possible to play with intensity and energy. We played with a low block and tried to find opportunities. Fortunately we got the three points.”

Benzema’s resurgence for France means Madrid no longer have their chief goalscorer all to themselves and after 17 games played already this term Ancelotti opted to leave the striker at home.

It meant a surprise start for Mariano Diaz but it was Vinicius who filled the void scoring his eighth and ninth goals of the season to continue an excellent run of form.

The 21-year-old Brazilian has long been circled as one of Madrid’s most exciting talents but he has found a different level under Ancelotti.

“I haven’t done anything” Ancelotti said. “I just try to give him confidence. I am not a magician.”

Elche came in 15th and unbeaten at the Martinez Valero this season and started well with Lucas Boye lashing an early shot at Thibaut Courtois.

At the other end Rodrygo ballooned over after a Madrid counter-attack and that was his last contribution before going off injured after 17 minutes replaced by Marco Asensio.

Vinicius gave Madrid the lead shortly after and it came from a Johan Mojica mistake at left-back as his loose pass was punched forward first-time by Casemiro into Mariano who backheeled behind him into the path of Vinicius.

Vinicius took one touch into the area and clipped a left-footed finish into the far corner.

Elche should have levelled but Lucas Perez skewed wide after a clever flick by Boye and they pushed again early in the second half.

Guti had the best chance but side-footed straight at Courtois and as the goalkeeper tossed the ball out to Toni Kroos Guti flew into the German his sliding challenge earning him a second yellow card.

A man up with half an hour left Madrid regained control and added a superb second. It started with a slick combination between their midfield three as Casemiro laid off for Kroos who steered a sumptuous pass through Elche’s midfield to Luka Modric.

Modric slid through Vinicius who drew out the goalkeeper just enough before scooping it over him and into the net.

Elche were given unexpected hope with five minutes left when Madrid gifted them a goal back. Casemiro and Kroos were guilty as Casemiro’s pass was cut out and headed straight into Pere Milla with the sliding Kroos failing to intercept. Milla finished past Courtois.

Pedro Bigas missed a header from one of numerous Elche crosses slung into the box but Madrid survived.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“La gente empieza a ver que ya hay pan y se llevan dos o tres piezas en lugar de lo que siempre compran. Nosotros vamos aumentando el número de panes porque se vende más cuando se comienzan a poner las ofrendas y vamos sacando los de más peso para las familias que comparten para tomar el chocolate” cuenta el dueño y administrador de la panadería La Flor.

Este año hay mucha gente que compra el pan para rellenar y venderlo. ""Se llevan varias piezas individuales y eso también nos ha ayudado en estas semanas” agrega.

En 2020 desde panaderías tradicionales hasta supermercados comenzaron a producir y comercializar el pan de muerto desde agosto como una estrategia para dar un empuje ante el menor consumo de pan de dulce durante la pandemia. Este año ya no fue necesario porque las personas ya salen más de casa y han recuperado el consumo.

En una encuesta llevada a cabo entre octubre de 2019 y marzo de 2020 la consultora Statista detectó que 94% de los entrevistados afirmaron consumir pan de muerto mientras que el 6% restante declaró no seguir con esta tradición.

En los supermercados el pan de muerto contribuye con aproximadamente el 13% de las ventas de temporada y los días con más ventas se registran a partir del 29 de octubre y hasta el 1 de noviembre de acuerdo con Nielsen. Esta pieza de pan que en sus presentaciones más comunes suele tener en la cubierta azúcar o ajonjolí ocupa la quinta posición en importancia en la categoría de pan dulce.

En el caso de autoservicios la venta valor del pan de muerto creció 17% con respecto al año terminado en agosto de 2020. Muy por encima del 7% registrado para productos empacados que se distribuyen en este canal según datos de Nielsen Ibope.

“La venta de pan de muerto es la temporalidad más importante no hay tantas ventas de otras piezas en otras épocas del año porque la rosca de reyes por ejemplo sólo se vende durante el día de Reyes el día que se acostumbra comer por tradición” comenta Elizabeth Beltrán.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYXJpbi5jb20vcnVyYWwvYnVlbm9zLXByZWNpb3MtdmVudGFzLWFnaWxlcy1yZW1hdGVzLXJhemFzLWJyYWZvcmQtYnJhbmd1cy1icmFobWFuXzBfOG9ZX3RIQUVXLmh0bWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGFyaW4uY29tL3J1cmFsL2J1ZW5vcy1wcmVjaW9zLXZlbnRhcy1hZ2lsZXMtcmVtYXRlcy1yYXphcy1icmFmb3JkLWJyYW5ndXMtYnJhaG1hbl8wXzhvWV90SEFFVy5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buenos precios y ventas ágiles en los remates de las razas Braford Brangus y Brahman,"En el marco de la Exposición Nacional de Razas que organiza Expoagro y cuenta con el apoyo del gobierno de Corrientes las firmas Colombo y Magliano e Iván L.

Autoridades locales y ONG tienen otros datos,"La venta de niñas es una práctica que fue nuevamente visibilizada por medios de comunicación. (Especial)

Chilpancingo Gro.- Conchita tenía 12 años cuando salió de su pueblo para huir de la tradición por la que las mujeres son entregadas en matrimonio.

A su corta edad Conchita veía cómo vivían sus hermanas sus primas sus amigas de la infancia y decidió que no quería repetir esas historias tan comunes en Santa Cruz municipio de Copanatoyac en La Montaña de Guerrero.

Iban a casarla con Jorge un señor que estaba de paso por la zona donde la empresa para la que trabajaba construía un camino.

Don Jorge la visitaba en su casa y la mamá de la menor le pedía que se arreglara cuando estaba por anochecer. El hombre platicaba con la adolescente pero no se mostraba interesada. Le decía que conocía la ciudad donde las mujeres tienen muchas opciones de tiendas para comprar ropa y zapatos.

Un día Conchita escuchó que su papá y Jorge arreglaban su matrimonio. Le lloró a su mamá y le pidió ayuda para irse del pueblo y como pudo salió huyendo del destino que muchas niñas tienen.

Llegó a Chilpancingo y buscó trabajo. La contrató una comerciante de un mercado que necesitaba quién le ayudara a cuidar a su bebé mientras atendía a los clientes. Por las tardes Conchita estudió su bachillerato y luego concluyó la licenciatura en Enfermería.

Hoy visita a su familia pero siente tristeza porque su padre aún no le perdona haberlo avergonzado al no cumplir con el trato que había asumido con Jorge.

La historia de Conchita es la de muchas niñas de varias comunidades indígenas de la región de La Montaña.

La venta de niñas es una práctica que fue nuevamente visibilizada luego de que medios de comunicación dieron a conocer que una mujer perdió a sus trillizos tras ser agredida por un policía comunitario cuando le llevó de comer a sus hijas y a su madre quienes habían sido detenidas.

La detención fue a petición del suegro de Angélica una niña de 15 años que había sido vendida y entregada en matrimonio a los 13 años en la comunidad de Dos Ríos en Cochoapa el Grande municipio de La Montaña.

El esposo de la menor se fue a trabajar a Estados Unidos y la niña se quedó en casa de sus suegros. Sin embargo el suegro intentó violarla por cuarta ocasión y ella no lo permitió y escapó por lo que el señor denunció que la menor no le obedecía y que la regresaría pero pedía que le pagaran más de 200 mil pesos por lo que había dado de “dote”. La familia le dijo que no tenía dinero y por eso fueron encarceladas tres menores y la abuela.

Este hecho atrajo la atención de los medios y se dio a conocer a nivel nacional.

Se imparten cursos de capacitación y talleres de concientización según la secretaria de Asuntos Indígenas y Afromexicanos Reyna Mejía Morales quien reconoció que no será suficiente “pero por algo se debe empezar”.

Tras declarar “nunca más la venta de niñas en Guerrero” la gobernadora Evelyn Salgado Pineda anunció que solicitará el apoyo de ONU-Mujeres para trazar una estrategia que permita avanzar en el combate a ese tipo de violencia.

La semana pasada en una visita a Guerrero el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador minimizó la problemática al considerar que la venta de menores es una excepción porque las comunidades tienen muchos valores.

“No es motivo para cuestionar a nadie” declaró recientemente en una de sus mañaneras.

Marina Reyna Aguilar directora de la asociación Contra la violencia hacia las mujeres lamentó que las cifras oficiales no reflejen en nada la realidad que viven las niñas de comunidades indígenas que siguen siendo víctimas de la trata de personas porque es un delito y debe ser castigado.

De acuerdo con el Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública desde 2016 cuando se genera la primera alerta de género en la fiscalía estatal se abrieron 4 carpetas de investigación; en 2017 fueron 3 en 2018 fueron 11; en 2019 fueron 19; en 2020 fueron 17 y en lo que va de 2021 van 4.

Reyna Aguilar explicó que para algunas comunidades indígenas sí es justificable como parte de sus usos y costumbres la venta de niñas y mujeres “aunque en realidad es un delito”.

Apuntó que no son denunciados esos hechos “porque es algo a lo que están habituados” los indígenas.

La activista sostuvo que en Guerrero “sabemos que eso es real pero que no se denuncia y quiere decir que se sigue dando una violación constante a los derechos humanos”.

Recordó que autoridades de los 3 niveles de gobierno realizan actividades y estrategias bajo la coordinación de la Secretaría de la Mujer la Secretaría de Asuntos Indígenas y Afromexicanos así como de la fiscalía local “pero evidentemente no ha habido los resultados deseados y la trata de personas se sigue dando”.

Por lo menos 300 mil niñas han sido vendidas y entregadas en matrimonio en Guerrero de acuerdo con Martha Givaudan presidenta de la organización “Yo quiero yo puedo” con oficinas en Metlatónoc otro municipio indígena de La Montaña.

Aunque aceptó que no hay cifras exactas porque la mayoría de esos arreglos matrimoniales no se registran sobre todo porque están prohibidos los matrimonios con menores de edad desde 2019.

Para la presidenta de la comisión de Igualdad del Congreso local Gabriela Bernal Reséndiz es lamentable que el presidente López Obrador minimice la venta de niñas y consideró que “no lo han informado bien de lo que en realidad sucede”.

Reconoció que es constante la violación a los derechos fundamentales de las niñas de algunas comunidades indígenas en La Montaña.

Reconoció la declaración de la gobernadora Salgado Pineda:

“Esa postura nos da gusto y habremos de esperar que se realicen acciones inmediatas en ese sentido también es necesario impulsar desde el Congreso leyes que garanticen la protección de nuestras niñas y que se castigue a quienes fomentan la trata de personas la trata de niñas”.

Bernal aseguró que desde el Congreso local se exigirá a las autoridades competentes que se haga valer la ley “que la apliquen en esos delitos tan graves como lo es la trata de personas”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZWxwZXJ1YW5vLnBlL25vdGljaWEvMTMyMzU0LXZlbnRhcy1yZXRhaWwtc3VwZXJhbi1uaXZlbGVzLXByZXBhbmRlbWlh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ventas 'retail' superan niveles prepandemia,

This week there was at least a partial answer. Verizon has signed a 20-year lease for 143000 square feet at 155 Delancey St. with an option to take the remainder of the office space.

According to the New York Post Verizon will move hundreds of employees including its marketing team from the telecommunications giant’s building at 140 West St. to the third through 5th floors of the mixed-use building called “The Artisan.” The deal includes use of a private outdoor terrace on the sixth floor. You will soon see Verizon branding on the building facade. The Post reported “The parties declined to comment on terms of the long-term deal but other real estate sources pegged the cost of the 20-year lease at roughly $80 per foot with over $130 per foot towards work in Verizon’s space.”

Verizon will need to decide by late next year whether to take the remaining 35000 square feet at 155 Delancey St. and another 175000 square feet at 145 Delancey St.

Years ago a community task force hashing out plans for the former urban renewal site chose to prioritize commercial/office development as part of the project. They saw it as a way of revitalizing daytime commercial activity on the Lower East Side with foot traffic from office workers. While 350000 square feet may not be a game changer there were hopes that a high profile office tenant at Essex Crossing could spur more commercial development in the neighborhood.

Yet there have always been concerns about whether big firms would make the move to the LES. This was the case long before the pandemic which hobbled New York City’s office market as a whole (it’s started to show some signs of life in recent months).

Essex Crossing developers have pitched their project as an ideal playground for young creative professionals who would find amenities like the Essex Market and the Market Line appealing. The outdoor space was also likely a big draw in the post-pandemic environment.

The next big challenges for Essex Crossing: launching phases two and 3 of the Market Line (only one section below the Essex Market has opened) and filling a lot of ground floor retail spaces in buildings stretching from Ludlow Street to Clinton Street. The team has also yet to redevelop the remaining sites north of Delancey Street the former home of the Essex Street Market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsbGFib3V0Y2lyY3VpdHMuY29tL25ld3MvNWctZnJvbS1zcGFjZS12ZXJpem9uLWFtYXpvbi10ZWFtLXVwLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWFudGVubmFzLWZvci1sZW8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5G From Space: Verizon and Amazon Team Up to Build Antennas for LEO Satellites - News,"This week Verizon Communications partnered up with Amazon’s Project Kuiper on a quest to innovate and expand a network of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites.

Established in 2019 Project Kuiper—a subsidiary of Amazon—plans to deploy a constellation of large broadband satellites to provide 4G/LTE and 5G to rural and remote areas. Once Project Kuiper is up and running Amazon will create transmission routes from its AWS cloud computing data centers directly to Kuiper customers through its satellites.

As a leading developer in telecommunications Verizon hopes its strategic partnership with Amazon’s Project Kuiper will increase the cellular backhaul with nearly 3236 LEO satellites.

Project Kuiper Takes on the Ka-band

Satellites often orbit the planet in the Ku-band which allows antenna developers to combine transmittal and receiving functions and minimize the device's footprint in the process. However when a satellite operates in the Ka-band the distance between the antennas must increase to operate correctly. This makes it difficult to create a compact solution that encloses both antennas.

Satellite frequency bands. Image used courtesy of the ESA

Last December Amazon reported that the Project Kuiper team found a way around these problems. The team designed hundreds of antennas in each aperture the opening through which light travels. Receiving antennas were able to operate between 18 and 20 GHz and transmitting antennas operated from 28 to 30 GHz surpassing Ku-band frequencies.

Verizon Teams Up With Project Kuiper on Antenna Design

Verizon has begun assisting the Project Kuiper team by defining technical requirements for a custom-built antenna architecture and adding fixed wireless coverage. Amazon’s prototype delivers speeds up to 400 Mbps (Megabits per second) while only needing a 12-inch diameter footprint.

Project Kuiper’s antenna is designed to be easily mass-produced through affordable materials and a simple architecture. Screenshot used courtesy of Amazon

The antenna design is unconventional. Typical Ka-band antennas place their transmittal and receiving antennas next to one another but with a good amount of separation leading to large surface areas. For Project Kuiper’s antenna the receiving and transmittal antennas are not next to each other but overlaid over one another. This orientation shrinks the surface area while maintaining the necessary separation for efficient performance.

How Does Project Kuiper Size Up to SpaceX’s Starlink?

SpaceX's Starlink program aims to provide satellite internet access to most of the earth. The Ka-band—the frequency range Project Kuiper is based on—is common for satellites to use since it offers wide bandwidth and small operating wavelengths.

SpaceX is planning its Starlink satellites to operate in various frequency bands: Ku- Ka- and V-bands. The V-band range starts around 40 GHz and can go up to 75 GHz. SpaceX has even nodded to the possibility of reaching the E-band range (90 GHz) which would be the highest frequency in low orbit.

Rendering of one of Starlink's satellites in orbit. Image used courtesy of SpaceX and Space

As of earlier this year the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved SpaceX's request to add 7500 V-band VLEO (very low earth orbit) satellites alongside Starlink's Ku- and Ka-band LEOs.

When Amazon disputed this request CEO Elon Musk claimed that Project Kuiper was an attempt to ""hamstring Starlink."" In response Amazon asserted that Kuiper satellites were designed to avoid interference with Starlink; SpaceX's venture into VLEO Amazon says could cause collisions in space and radio interference for consumers.

Hurdles for Kuiper's LEO Satellites

Following the announcement of Project Kuiper’s antenna design Nima Mahanfar senior manager of Project Kuiper’s antenna development discussed potential challenges that may still lie ahead—from materials sourcing to technology issues.

“Solving power challenges in space is hard and dissipating the heat from that power is even harder"" Mahanfar explains. ""There’s no air to cool it. So having a low-power system that can provide many gigabytes of service to customers is key.”

CMOS technology will be key to Project Kuiper’s success. Materials such as silicon have been improved over the years to handle higher frequencies in extreme climates making them an apt candidate for the antenna material that will be exposed to space.

Cellular technology and cloud services are other potential hurdles for the Kuiper team. With more devices needing higher broadband and bandwidth it is imperative that the new antenna design incorporates 5G cellular technology. Couple that with increased data traffic in data centers and it's clear what a substantial challenge it will be for Amazon to become a one-stop shop for global connectivity.

Project Kuiper Attracts Another Big-name Partner

In addition to Verizon Facebook’s Connectivity team has also expressed interest in joining Project Kuiper. This partnership would launch a grid of satellites by providing resources such as funding and engineers. Facebook is currently in similar partnerships with Hughes Network Systems and Viasat.

Project Kuiper appears to be stacked with many partnerships—aiming to take control of the skies as the main broadband provider for communities worldwide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdC1tb2JpbGUtNWctc3VwcmVtYWN5LXZlcml6b24tYXR0LW1vY2tpbmdfaWQxMzYwODLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile goes back to its Verizon and AT&T-mocking roots to highlight its 5G supremacy (again),"



While he did stop short of calling the first and third-largest US wireless service providers names T-Mo President of Technology Neville Ray certainly pulled no punches at While he did stop short of calling the first and third-largest US wireless service providers names T-Mo President of Technology Neville Ray certainly pulled no punches at this week's MWC Los Angeles event when touting some of his company's greatest 5G achievements so far and even greater ambitions looking ahead.

Are the ""other guys nuts"" for not following Magenta's suit?





Verizon and AT&T may have indirectly acknowledged the errors of their initial 5G rollout ways by acquiring a wealth of C-Band spectrum recently but according to Neville Ray the two's revised network upgrade strategies remain inherently flawed from a number of key perspectives.





For one thing T-Mo is hard at work on combining mid-band 5G technology with low-band for uplink which is apparently a ""super exciting"" breakthrough... even though it doesn't really sound that way.

















That's at least what Neville Ray claims will happen relatively soon and yet for some reason Verizon and AT&T have apparently expressed no interest in implementing a similar technology for their future C-Band networks envisioned as direct alternatives for T-Mobile's industry-dominating 5G UC.





The only logical (and hilarious) conclusion is that the ""other guys"" must be ""nuts"" for not seeing what T-Mo sees as the future of 5G stateside.

AT&T's 5G+? More like ""5G minus""









For those unaware Ma Bell is using a 5G+ label for its blazing fast but terribly spotty mmWave signal right now planning to expand... the meaning of the marketing moniker to cover C-Band technology as well in the near future.













Namely AT&T's misleading use of a 5GE icon on phones that were in fact still connected to good old fashioned 4G LTE. That apparently ""started"" all of this confusion that still goes on today but it's not like T-Mobile is doing a whole lot to end things in a clear and mature way. Not with the 5G UC logo encompassing both mid-band and mmWave technology and with customers undeniably struggling to tell the differences between Ultra Capacity and Extended Range 5G (aka regular 5G) at first glance.





Of course the point about AT&T's 5G+ network currently feeling like ""5G minus"" due to very limited availability definitely stands. After all we're talking about a staggering difference between around five million people theoretically covered by Ma Bell's blazing fast mmWave signal and the 186 million (potential) T-Mobile subscribers capable of getting lower but still impressive mid-band speeds





Keep in mind that the 186 million number is set to jump to ""almost"" 200 million by the end of the year alone and as many as 300 million people in 2023. That's close to the current availability of T-Mo's nationwide Extended Range 5G network which is itself close to covering the entire population of the US.





In other words it's almost physically impossible to envision a scenario in which AT&T or Verizon will be able to catch up to the early leader of the US 5G landscape anytime in the next two or three years.





Well that didn't take long. It was only a few months back that we reported on T-Mobile 's apparent shift from an advertising strategy largely reliant on pointing out the competition's weaknesses to a more ""boring"" approach and already the ""Un-carrier"" seems to have returned to its old ""Dumb and Dumber"" ways ... kind of.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMS8xMC9mdXR1cmUtdGVuc2UtbmV3c2xldHRlci1vZGUtbGctY2hvY29sYXRlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future Tense newsletter: An ode to the LG Chocolate.,"Sign up to receive the Future Tense newsletter every other Saturday.

If you weren’t lucky enough to own a LG Chocolate phone I should probably start by describing it for you. The Chocolate’s rectangular face was filled by a screen a circular dial and some top-of-the-line touch-sensitive glowing-red controls. With a quick flick of your thumb the phone slid up revealing a numerical keypad. The Chocolate was part-phone part-MP3 player and the first edition was launched in the U.S. in July 2006. It came in black white red pink and green all colors which all allowed for a convenient extension of the phone’s confectionary theme—you could pick between Dark White Cherry Strawberry and Mint Chocolates.

It’s hard to put it better than this delightful 2007 review in the Canadian edition of PC World: “The phone’s namesake is kind of fitting for it given how it looks like a piece of dark chocolate that someone might eat with a knife and fork. When you first open it up it appears so pristine that I wouldn’t be surprised if someone out there actually did try taking a bite out of it.” And who could forget the iconic LG Chocolate commercial featuring Christina Aguilera’s “Candyman”?

I was the proud owner of a Mint Chocolate VX8500 which my great-grandfather won in a contest. (At the time he spent much of his time entering mail-in or online contests and won things quite frequently.) It was my second phone and I was probably around 11. I got my first phone shortly before when a different grandfather passed away. It was earlier than my parents had planned to get me a cellphone but there it was ownerless and being paid for in their Verizon plan … so what the heck. That first phone was a basic thing bluish-silver a small antenna sticking out at the top and I wasn’t able to do much with it beyond make calls send texts and frequently change the ringtone in accordance with my mood. The Mint Chocolate though was like a portal to a different world. It was slick beautiful and full of possibilities—great photos (for 2009) a music library Bluetooth … the list goes on.

More than a decade later I still think often about my LG Chocolate phone—the moments it got me through what it meant to me. For me what made the LG Chocolate so special is that it stood as an intermediary between what phones were and what they might be (and now are). It was also as an intermediary for those of us who grew up half with cellphones and half without them for what technology could mean in our lives.

I was born (on this day!) in 1997 the first year marking the start of Gen Z according to the Pew Research Center. Still I generally prefer to think of myself as a millennial because a) it seems more fun and b) most of the people I went to school with and now interact with are millennials. (Maybe if Pew had opted for iGeneration another option it apparently considered instead of the boring “Gen Z” I would feel differently.)

Those of us generational borderliners elder Gen Z-ers and baby Millennials grew up in a before-and-after moment. My ugly flip phone was the before my iPhone loaded with the Facebook app was the after and the Mint Chocolate was my in-between there with me in the middle school years when many of us do our messiest growing up.

The Chocolate was the first and last time I felt I had a phone for me. I liked looking at its soft green color. I don’t remember if I ever loaded music on it but I liked knowing I could. I liked the independence it gave me—I could finally go to the mall after school with a friend without my parents hovering around. I liked teaching my grandma how to text and then seeing the Chocolate’s screen light up with a notification from her.

In contrast these days I feel my phone’s primary function is to make other people’s lives better—for colleagues to email me and get a fast response for Mark Zuckerberg to cash in on my scrolling for the person calling about a survey to reach someone who feels too guilty to hang up. When I bought a new iPhone last year I chose a mint green that I thought would be similar to my Chocolate. It was not.

You may feel like I’m being dramatic with my emotional attachment here or looking for greater meaning where it doesn’t exist. It’s just a clunky phone! Still it’s not hard to find people who feel the same “strange passion” for the Chocolate—it’s a common protagonist when you ask someone about their cell phone lineage and you can find recent unboxing videos on YouTube or Chocolates being sold on eBay. And indeed this sentimentality was baked into the DNA of the Chocolate. “Just as Apple’s iPod created a new culture among users of digital music players Chocolate connects to emotions of its users” Cha Kang Heui LG’s chief handset designer told NBC News in 2006.

In the U.S. four versions of the Chocolate were eventually sold though the original was the most iconic—reportedly selling 21 million units making it one of the most popular phones in LG history. The Chocolate was also a global phenomenon. It was first released in Korea in 2005 and later in Europe before coming to the U.S. and elsewhere. I recently found out that my partner who grew up in Mexico also had a Chocolate phone and felt on top of the world when he got one around age 15. “It was the sensation” he remembered.

It’s easy to feel nostalgic about things like the LG Chocolate. I often feel the need to lecture my 18-year-old brother whose primary form of communication is Snapchat about “simpler times”—the same way people 20 years older than me love to say “we used to have to …” followed by some description of a character-building activity like “print a map” or “remember phone numbers.”

But that nostalgia isn’t always useful or well placed. Neither is the judgy tone we often use with people who have grown up with technology differently than we did. (How much can it really bother you that the youth use Snapchat and Instagram DMs to talk to their friends instead of picking up the phone?)

Advertisement

More fundamentally this ode is a hypocritical one because if I really wanted to I could change my iPhone back to a Chocolate. But alas I would never do that—the constant connection of a smartphone exhausts me but the thought of the absence of that connection terrifies me. And as great as the Chocolate was it certainly couldn’t handle my Google Photos library or my earthquake alarm app or WhatsApp.

Besides it’s more fun to reminisce about a phone that by default allowed me to have a healthier relationship with technology than to get to work fixing the screen-life relationship I actually have. So for that luxury of denial—and so much more—thank you LG Chocolate.

Future Tense Recommends

I’m about halfway through Robert Kolker’s Hidden Valley Road which follows the Galvins a family of 12 children including six with schizophrenia. Kolker documents the family’s deeply personal journey with the disorder and the abuse loss and pain it manifested as well as the larger significance of the Galvin case for medical research on the genetic roots and potential treatments for schizophrenia. In introducing us to the Galvin siblings Kolker portrays mental illness as part of who someone is not who they are an important distinction that is often absent from coverage of schizophrenia and similar conditions. I picked up the book hoping to learn more about the disorder after my uncle who had schizophrenia passed away earlier this year. (I wrote about his death for The Marshall Project.) It’s a hard book to read—but I think a necessary one.

A few days later all traces of the Northern Nevada gaming mainstay were gone the sign’s outline whitewashed by a fresh coat of paint.

It was a beginning in an end. The closure of Harrah’s after nearly 84 years in the Northern Nevada city also signifies the rebirth of downtown Reno as the city seeks to broaden its economy.

Harrah’s Reno shut its doors in March 2020 when the pandemic forced a 78-day shutdown of Nevada gaming industry. It never reopened. The property was sold two months earlier by Caesars Entertainment and VICI Properties for $50 million to Las Vegas-based CAI Investments a real estate development and management company.

CAI announced at the time it would convert the aging 980-room hotel-casino into Reno City Center a mixed-use development with 530 one- and two-bedroom residential units. Commercial office space restaurants and retail offerings would replace the casino.

In place of the Harrah’s sign there will be a building-height illustration of a downtown Reno map with the Truckee River and highlighting City Center’s location as the original casino in the Harrah’s chain opened by William F. “Bill” Harrah in 1937.

The development is expected to open early next year.

CAI Investments CEO Chris Beavor who grew up in Reno idealizes a downtown framed by the Truckee River that underscores Northern Nevada’s outdoor lifestyle. He said other residential developments would move from the planning stages to construction based on the success of Reno City Center.

“We look for a void in the marketplace and what Reno needs right now is people living and breathing in downtown” Beavor said. “That’s one way you activate the community.”

City leaders the business community and operators of Reno’s casinos believe transforming downtown from a gaming destination into a place with affordable living spaces vibrant restaurants stylish hotel rooms and non-gaming entertainment options will stimulate the market.

“Quite honestly Reno has needed a bigger and bolder vision for a long time” said Mayor Hillary Schieve who is nearing the end of her second four-year term as the city’s top elected official and is credited with helping to revitalize the city’s Midtown area. “Downtown has suffered for many years. We need to bring tourism back but in a different way. I think it's good to have a completely different set of eyes because you have new people coming here.”

Mike Kazmierski CEO of the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN) pointed to Reno’s declining gaming numbers over the past couple of decades as a reason the community needed to shift focus. He cited a UNR study that found 13.8 percent of Reno’s economy in 2002 was driven by gaming. By 2020 that figure was down to 5.3 percent.

“We realized (10 years ago) we needed a new economy” Kazmierski said.

Jacobs Entertainment CEO Jeff Jacobs has owned the Sands Regency in downtown Reno for more than five years with plans to develop the area surrounding the casino into the Reno Neon Line District a mixed-use entertainment and housing project. He began buying up property in 2010.

He headed a similar redevelopment effort in downtown Cleveland some three decades ago.

“We created different districts such as entertainment along the Cuyahoga River. Other parts of downtown came along” Jacobs said of the changes in Ohio’s second-largest city in terms of population.“I think that’s what is going to happen here … We’re planting seeds for change.”

Brendan Bussmann a partner in Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors who has studied Reno for clients said the city “clearly has the need to diversify and is transitioning older assets to support affordable housing and other amenities for the changing dynamics in Reno.”

Gaming revenues up in 2021

Ironically Reno’s casino market is in the midst of its best gaming revenue performance since 2005. Reno casino revenue for the first nine months of the year is 16.8 percent ahead of 2019’s pre-pandemic figure of $636.9 million according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

“Reno continued to benefit from strong population migration dynamics from California and other high tax jurisdictions” Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas said last week following the quarterly earnings release by Monarch Casino & Resort the parent company of Reno’s Atlantis Casino Resort. “Management noted the third quarter saw strong demand across all segments with higher customer spend.”

However when comparing Reno’s current situation to 2000 when Reno casinos recorded a single-year record of more than $859 million in total gaming revenues the market still has a steep hill to climb. Reno is 16.1 percent behind the record with just three months remaining in 2021.

Beginning in 2001 the rapid expansion of tribal-operated casinos in Northern California took away customers and sliced into Reno’s gaming market over the next decade. The nationwide recession that began in the late 2000s took another slice out of the Northern Nevada economy

Reno casinos accounted for 11.6 percent of the statewide total gaming revenue of almost $9.6 billion in 2000. By 2019 that figure was 5.2 percent during Nevada’s $12 billion revenue year.

The number of gaming locations in Reno also declined.

According to the Control Board in fiscal year 1995 Reno had 27 locations that reported gaming and non-gaming information to the Gaming Abstract a publication that covers revenues for casinos that grossed $1 million or more during a fiscal year. By fiscal year 2020 the number of Reno reporting locations was down to 16.

Bussmann doesn’t believe Reno will ever return to the level of gaming level it saw in 2000 especially because of California’s continued expansion which saw two tribal casinos near Sacramento open in 2019 and another looking at a 2022 opening.

""There are too many other factors in the region” he said. “While Reno continues to grow it has gone from a larger regional market to a much more locals market.”

Reno’s gaming totals reported monthly by the state include downtown and smaller casinos and multiple slot machine-only locations such as the games inside the Reno Tahoe Airport. But the figures don’t break out results by individual casinos.

Four of the major casinos in Reno — Sands Regency Peppermill Grand Sierra and Cal-Neva — are privately held and do not individually disclose gaming revenues.

Last year Reno-based Eldorado Resorts completed its $17.3 billion merger with Caesars Entertainment taking on the corporate name. The company operates three resorts along Virginia Street — Eldorado Silver Legacy and Circus Circus — collectively as “The Row.”

Caesars folds the quarterly results from its Reno properties into its regional totals that include financial information from 43 casinos in 16 states.

Monarch combines the Atlantis quarterly results with the company casino in Black Hawk Colorado.

A market transforms

EDAWN has focused efforts on bringing technology companies manufacturing businesses and non-gaming industries into the region to reduce the region’s economic reliance on the casino industry.

Beyond the area’s high-profile business developments such as Amazon’s fulfillment center and Tesla’s Gigafactory Kazmierski said dozens of small and mid-sized businesses have relocated or are considering relocating to the area. Company leaders want to see infrastructure added such as affordable housing and services he added.

In his view Reno City Center and other projects will help revive downtown attract additional developments and create a better market for current casino operators.

“For the gamers that are here now these types of non-gaming projects provide them a better market share so they can be more successful” Kazmierski said. “Because you have people here with good paying jobs they have the ability to engage in the downtown area.”

Beavor has not disclosed a cost to transform the hotel-casino into the mixed-use development. Brent Lovett of Luxe Industries who is overseeing the renovation and conversion of the facility’s more than 1.4 million square feet said Reno City Center is the area’s largest “adaptive re-use project ever attempted.”

Beavor’s company also plans to build a 20-story Kimpton hotel along downtown’s riverwalk area. The mixed-use property from the San Francisco-based Kimpton chain will be fully non-smoking. The project includes plans for 270 hotel rooms 50 private condominium residences 60000 square feet of office space and 20000 square feet of meeting space.

Jacobs’ plans for the Reno Neon Line District a roughly 20-block parcel from West Street to Keystone Avenue and from the Truckee River to Interstate 80 include affordable housing through condominiums and apartments.

He’s also looking at restaurants entertainment venues and a festival space. There are also plans to install a 1500-foot-long zipline attraction starting from the top of the Sands Regency which he is in the process of renovating and rebranding at a cost of $400 million.

All told Jacobs said the Neon Line combined with other Reno developments could total between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion in investments.

“I think people are going to start going up vertically for housing” he said.

Watching on the sidelines is Caesars Entertainment. With a combined 4060 rooms nearly 225000 square feet of casino space and nearly 50 restaurants bars and lounges operators of The Row have a vested interest in downtown Reno’s future.

Row General Manager Ken Ostempowski said the casino company wants to be partners with everybody in downtown Reno. He knows attractions outside of the three resorts allow Caesars hotel guests to “see other things.”

At the same time luxury condominiums apartments and other residential offerings mean additional customers and more guests for The Row’s casinos and restaurants.

“We're a huge advocate of additional residential facilities down here” Ostempowski said. “For a city to grow people have to live there. Otherwise they become ghost towns after everybody leaves at night. We’re encouraged by City Center and what Jacobs is doing. It all means more people downtown.”

Casinos are making changes

Reno’s casino community is also focused on expanding non-gaming areas.

Tony Marini vice president of operations for The Row has long worked for the Carano family founders of Eldorado and now top executives throughout Caesars. He said longtime Eldorado customers continue to visit the properties regardless of a new corporate operating structure.

Hotel room renovations have been completed at all three properties including upgrades to the Silver Legacy’s suites. Indoor Top Golf driving range simulators have been added to several Eldorado suites and the Carnival Midway at Circus Circus was “reinvented” with a lineup of new games.

“Gaming is not new here” Marini said. “You just can't just open a door in Reno and expect everybody to show up. You have to have something different and you have to give customers something special.”

In August Monarch CEO John Farahi told The Nevada Independent the company was exploring ideas for a potential mixed-use development on 40 acres near Atlantis that would coincide with a rapidly expanding Reno.

“We want to see what the prospects are for this city” Farahi said. Last week he told investors Atlantis rooms in the property’s original tower would undergo a renovation early next year.

Schieve said tourism needs to return to downtown through “in a different way.” She suggested technology and non-traditional games such as the competitive video game world of esports would attract a younger clientele.

“Reno has an opportunity to really capitalize on that market and have an understanding of this new generation of gaming” Schieve said. “I think a lot of people are forgetting about that.”

A non-gaming focus

Reno’s conversion to non-gaming took a leap forward in 2014 when the shuttered Fitzgeralds Reno was reopened as the Whitney Peak Hotel an independent non-gaming non-smoking 310-room hotel near the Reno Arch. The property includes an indoor climbing gym and “Whitney Peak's Basecamp” a 164-foot-tall outdoor climbing wall that reaches the building’s roof and has been designated by the Guinness Book of World Records as the ""Tallest Artificial Climbing Wall.""

“You have to embrace change. I know it's hard for a lot of people” Schieve said. “That’s why I think it's so critical for the city to build those relationships with developers so that we have a sense of pride in the project but we also have some skin in the game.”

Beavor is already filling up City Center.

In addition to the residential plans the second through fourth floors of the main tower have been leased by a technology company. The space will be converted to offices for roughly 600 workers.

“Hopefully some of them will be living on our property” Beavor said. “When they get off work they will probably stay around and activate downtown.”

Beavor said Fine Entertainment of Las Vegas which operates six PKWY Taverns in Southern Nevada will bring a couple of restaurant concepts to the facility. There will also be a coffee bar a gym and pet daycare facility for residents.

The site has retained its gaming entitlements but there will never be a full-scale casino he said. More likely a bar or tavern operator could gain a restricted gaming license for up to 15 slot machines. The former Harrah’s Plaza along Virginia Street is being converted into an outdoor park-like setting.

Once the first tower renovation is completed Beavor said the company will focus redevelopment on the east tower which is being used to house construction workers.

Jacobs’ attention is on the area west of The Row properties.

Last week the Reno City Council voted to adopt an ordinance approving its development agreement which covered financial incentives and development standards for projects within Reno Neon Line district.

From his 17th floor office atop the Sands Regency Jacobs can point to some of the locations for the Neon Line elements. He said the initial effort will be in residential areas. He is putting two sites out for bid for third party developers.

“This is an Opportunity Zone (which includes tax breaks and other development incentives) so I think I'll see some of those folks coming around here in a few months” Jacobs said.

UNR seeks a ‘connectivity’

Everyone interviewed mentioned another party interested in helping revive downtown Reno — UNR President Brian Sandoval.

The former governor who took over the university’s leadership 13 months ago said in an interview that connecting the college to downtown would benefit both locations. UNR and the downtown area are separated physically by I-80 but connected through several overpasses.

UNR already has Canyon Flats a 200-bed off-campus student housing development on the downtown side of I-80. It is roughly a five-minute walk from campus along Center Street.

Sandoval has other ideas to establish a connection between UNR and downtown. Initially he would like the Reno City Council to rename Center Street to University Way.

“That creates even more connectivity with the community” Sandoval said. “But second it can be a catalyst for a university district in the future given that you already have Canyon Flats.”

The second piece is the Mathewson University Gateway the future home of the school’s College of Business a life sciences building and a third-yet-to-be determined building. Sandoval is hopeful the business building can serve as a connection with downtown Reno.

“We're exploring the possibility of a public-private partnership where we would work with the business community and have a combination of your traditional classroom and conference space” Sandoval said.

He has also chatted with Schieve about improving bicycle lanes to further connect downtown with UNR. Sandoval also said he has talked with several developers including Beavor about partnering on affordable housing for graduate students.

“The amount of development and private investment is really going to change the face of Reno” Sandoval said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its wooden doors are timeworn after months of opening up for people in need of a handful of packaged food or someone else adding cans of soup to keep the shelves stocked.

During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 the pantry that stands along 12 Mile Road in front of the Berkley First Church revealed an emerging food insecurity problem within the city limits and surrounding areas.

“To see how fast the Little Pantry was being emptied when the pandemic hit it blew my mind that so many of my neighbors were in need” said Berkley resident Liz Petry.

As the pandemic continued to impact food resources Petry joined several other people who connected through a Facebook page to stock the Little Pantry as often as they could. It was there that she met two women who would become her partners in creating the Berkley Cares Food Pantry a full-service pantry headquartered inside the Berkley First Church.

Berkley residents Jessica and Casey Worrall were active in providing food for the Little Pantry but knew like Petry that there needed to be a broader outreach.

“It’s an idea that snowballed. Without any judgment and nothing but absolute love we want to help these people” Jessica Worrall stated.

Fear of ridicule and a sense of shame frequently prevent someone from asking for help to feed themselves and their families. Hunger often is what Stacy Averill Vice President of Community Giving at Gleaners Community Food Bank refers to as a “silent issue.”

“There is a gap in where people’s imaginations go when they think of hunger and the gap is ‘well it’s not in my community. It couldn’t be in Rochester Hills or in my affluent community.’ But we know that there is hunger in every city we know that kids in every school district struggle with hunger. In Oakland County specifically there are more than 150000 people children and adults who do not have access to enough nutritious food and that is an increase of 23% since before the pandemic” Averill said.

The doors of the Berkley Cares Food Pantry officially opened to the public in early October with an event called Pack the Pantry. Berkley residents were asked to help stock the shelves with perishable and non-perishable food and personal care items. Their benevolent response overwhelmed the three partners.

“The Berkley residents are so supportive” Petry said as she told the story of a woman who came to the event with an SUV packed with cases of food to donate. “I didn’t know if I wanted to cry or hug her.”

“It goes back to Berkley Cares it’s the motto of the city. The city is so special we really do care about other people” Casey Worrall added.

Feeding America a nationwide food bank network reports that food pantries across the United States are providing food assistance for an average of 55% more people now than prior to the pandemic.

For many Oakland County residents who are experiencing food insecurity a local pantry may be their only source of help. A significant percentage of the population fall outside of the income limits of the federal poverty level guidelines making them ineligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. SNAP provides monthly food purchasing support to those who qualify.

“They are not the only one who is hungry they are not the only one in this situation” said Jessica Worrall as she spoke about the community they serve. “In fact most of the population finds themselves in a time like this at some time in their life. I hope they know that they would never get judgment from this place and that they know they are welcome to come here anytime.”

Inside the storage room of the Berkley Cares Food Pantry volunteers pack care boxes designated for single households and families with enough food for up to three days of nutrition. Personal care items pet food and cleaning products are available on request but dependent on what items are in stock.

The team is also working to have food on hand for people with allergies and other medical issues such as diabetes and heart disease.

“We want parents and others to feel safe we have a shelf that is dedicated to gluten-free nut-free so if we need to exchange those items out for your child or for you if it’s there you can have it. No questions no judgment just come and ask for a box. We will do our best to supply what you need” Casey Worrall said.

The Berkley Cares Food Pantry is in Berkley First: A United Methodist Church located at 2820 12 Mile Road. Pantry days are every Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Patrons are asked to remain in their cars where a volunteer will take their order and place the box in their trunk. If someone is without a car walk-ups are welcome.

Home delivery is available for senior adults over 65-years-old who live within a three-mile radius of Berkley. Call 248-907-0723 at least 24-hours prior to the pantry day to schedule a delivery.

If you would like to donate food personal care items or pet food to the pantry or for additional information please go to berkleycaresfoodpantry.com or send an email to berkleycaresfoodpantry@gmail.com

According to Fact.MR the market is poised to surpass $ 3.2 billion in 2020 and will reach $ 10.4 billion by 2031.

The research company said that there a significant rise in rail accidents during the last few years. According to the National Crime Records Bureau report around 70 fatalities were reported across India every day due to train-related accidents in 2019.

The adoption of advanced technologies such as CBTC systems has surged to improve the efficiency of railway transportation and make it safer. Driven by this sales of CBTC systems are estimated to more than triple through 2031.

Governments of various countries are investing extensively in the expansion of railway infrastructure Fact.MR said. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation the government of India allocated $ 15.19 billion to the Ministry of Railways to develop advanced railway infrastructure. Government funding towards integrating the latest technologies in railway infrastructure will aid the overall expansion of the market.

Some of the leading players in the market include Thales Group Siemens Mobility ABB Lockheed Martin Alstom Hitachi Kyosan Tech Mahindra Toshiba Argenia Railway Technologies Critical Software Wabtec WAGO WSP Global and Meteorcomm.

Metro Trains

The metro trains segment is projected to exhibit the highest growth in terms of train type expanding at an impressive CAGR of 11.2% through 2031.

According to Fact.MR analyst the government's emphasis on integrating advanced sensor-based technologies such as CBTC systems to enhance operational efficiency safeguard cargos from theft and reduce the number of train accidents is expected to bode well for the market.

Key Takeaways

The US is projected to hold an absolute dollar opportunity of $ 868.6 billion exhibiting growth at a CAGR of 12.7% through 2031. China and Japan are estimated to cumulatively account for more than 75% of the revenue share in the East Asia market by 2031. India is expected to witness the fastest growth in South Asia & Oceania expanding at a CAGR of 12% during the coming decade. Europe is forecast to emerge as the second-largest market for CBTC systems accounting for nearly 1/3rd of the global sales over the forecast period. GoA2 is anticipated to hold a dominant share in the segment in terms of grade of automation accounting for more than 1/4th of the overall demand through 2031.

According to Fact.MR the key drivers for the market growth include the expansion of railway infrastructure to support metro trains across emerging countries such as India China France and others driving the CBTC systems sales.

Besides rapid industrialisation and urbanisation are propelling the demand for new subway engines and building new railway lines to enhance transportation infrastructure propelling the demand for CBTC systems.

However the high initial cost and cost of maintenances of CBTC systems are hampering the market's growth. In addition increasing shift towards high-speed trains to decrease the travel time across the US Japan the UK Germany and others is expected to hinder the sales of CBTC systems across metro trains segment the research firm observed.

According to Fact.MR the top five companies in the global communication-based train control system market is estimated to account for more than 50% of the overall share by 2031.

Leading companies are focusing on adopting inorganic strategies such as agreement collaboration merger and acquisition to enhance their product portfolio and increase their market share the research firm added.

WMT,Walmart,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbWVkY2l0eW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvd2h5LXRyYW5zY2FyZW50LWlzLXNlbmRpbmctc2VsZi1pbnN1cmVkLWNvbXBhbmllcy10by13YWxtYXJ0cy1oZWFsdGgtc2VydmljZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Transcarent is sending self-insured companies to Walmart’s health services,"At HLTH Walmart’s new healthcare leader Dr. Cheryl Pegus and Transcarent CEO Glen Tullman talked about ways to make healthcare accessible for more people.

The two companies recently struck a partnership. It’s not so much about Transcarent offering its services to Walmart as it is about Transcarent offering Walmart’s healthcare services to other self-insured companies.

“It allows self-insured employers to get access to the buying power of Walmart” Tullman said in an interview with MedCity News.

For example companies could access Walmart’s drug prices such as its $4 generics. Walmart also recently struck a deal with Novo Nordisk to offer a private label version of its analog fast-acting insulin for about $73 per vial a significant discount from current prices.

Transcarent could do a “med checkup” to identify medications where people could save money and reduce patient copays.

“We know the higher the copay the less people pick up their meds. So who does that impact disproportionately? It’s the lower quartile economically” he said. “It’s surprising how many meds (there are) where people are paying in some cases very large copays and we think we can eliminate a lot of that.”

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Employees would also have access to Walmart’s other health services including its vision centers testing primary care and telehealth services.

“Those are all areas we’ll explore” he said.

In recent years Walmart has set out to build health centers in its stores which include primary care dental therapy and other preventive services. Walmart has a little over 20 of such health centers and more planned to open but the rollout has been slow as many top leaders behind the effort have departed.

Self-insured companies would also be able to access telehealth services through MeMD which Walmart acquired earlier this year emphasizing virtual behavioral health services.

At HLTH Pegus said Walmart made the acquisition after seeing that the company’s customers were looking for primary care and behavioral health.

“When we looked at these communities… what we said is how do you get them care not five years from now when we build more clinics — we have a number of them today we’re going into Florida next year — but it takes a while to get clinics to all of these places” she said. ” We needed to have a tool and a service to be able to do that. We did an acquisition earlier this year to be able to provide that.”

Meanwhile Transcarent will continue to build on its work of striking risk-based agreement with companies to steer their employees to higher quality and lower cost care settings. Tullman the former chairman of Livongo debuted his newest venture earlier this year giving employees access to health guides second opinions medication reviews and virtual physical therapy. As of this summer it had more than 100 self-funded employers as clients some of which it brought on by acquiring a surgical centers of excellence program.

His job to turn around the Texas-based retailer became more complicated thanks to COVID-19.

Buchanan a former Walmart and Sam’s Club executive in Bentonville spoke recently at the Texas A&M Center for Retailing Studies Summit in Dallas. He said he was happy at Walmart and Sam’s Club and raising his family in Northwest Arkansas when Michaels came calling. But the idea of moving back to his home state had some appeal as did managing a turnaround at the smaller specialty retailer.

Two weeks into his job as CEO Buchanan said he called his first COVID meeting as he watched it spread across Asia and into Europe. In the fall of 2019 Buchanan said he read a novel on the Spanish flu pandemic from 1918 so he felt the need to act early. He said he knew omnichannel would become more important even in the hands-on crafting space but he had no idea how fast arts and crafts would take off once consumers stayed at home.

In the early pandemic days of April 2020 NPD Group reported a 70% increase in arts and crafts sales particularly in craft kits and reusable compounds. The increased consumer interest continued throughout 2020 with indexed Google search volumes for terms like “knitting” “embroidery” and “crocheting” outpacing the year prior 6% 12% and 18% respectively according to Google Trends.

In 2021 the more prominent players began focusing on social media strategies and building out their ad targeting strategies to appeal to the casual crafter.

“I think the crafting sector will remain larger than it was pre-pandemic” said Neil Saunders managing director of retail search agency GlobalData Retail. “However I think it will be difficult to replicate the kind of sales growth that was seen in 2020.” He added that to further aid growth “crafting retailers need to keep customers engaged maybe by creating online communities with videos and tutorials and a social aspect.”

Buchanan said that before Michaels could benefit from the crafting craze there was plenty of work to do. He said e-commerce was a paltry 4% of total sales and the user experience was terrible as there was no mobile app and conversions were less than 1% of visits. He said the backroom was overrun with inventory and the high/low pricing strategy was exhausting.

The first order of business was to check-in with customers. Buchanan said he spoke to thousands of customers and the consensus answer he got was that loyal customers loved Michaels but the company was making it complicated. He said the retailer had also somewhat lost its identity as an arts and crafts retailer for makers and crafters.

“We were carrying way too much home decor and not enough crafting materials” he said. “I knew we would need to streamline our supply chain and back rooms to be effective once the pandemic hit the U.S. At the time our inventory averaged seven touches which is unacceptable in retail. We got that down to two. We also added two new distribution centers and equipped our 1200 stores to do curbside pickup for online orders by the time the pandemic hit the U.S.”

Buchanan said he also insisted on a new home office location that allowed for open and collaborative spaces. And because there was so much office space on the market the costs were lower and the new space was 40% smaller than the segmented home office built in the 1980s.

He said the company is just getting started on the total transformation comparing it to being in the third inning of a nine-inning baseball game. One area he worked to improve was the social community that began to blossom amid the pandemic. He said that because Michaels had worked to revamp its website with outside developers and internal tech division the retailer could easily host programming for making art projects. He said this part of the business has taken off and there are free classes on the site and paid sessions. Participants can order the supplies in a bundle and pick them up at the local store or deliver them before class.

He said the inventory overruns were thinned out last year by running promotions for the curbside pickup. With leaner inventory the company can focus more on serving the “makers” which are the bread and butter for the business.

Michaels grew its social media followers to 3.2 million last year and recorded sales of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 up 12% from the prior-year period. Private equity firm Apollo Capital Management purchased the company in March 2021 for $5 billion. Buchanan said the move to private has been seamless and it has also allowed more agility for big moves without worrying about shaking investor confidence on Wall Street.

Buchanan said Michaels’ chief competitors in the U.S. are Hobby Lobby which focuses more on home decor items and Joann which has a fabric focus. Joann saw a 24.3% boost in revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. Based in Oklahoma City Hobby Lobby is also a private company with more than 930 U.S. store locations. Company revenue ahead of the pandemic was estimated at $5 billion annually more than double that of Michaels.

Joann is based in Cleveland Ohio and is run by former Tyson Foods and Walgreen’s executive Wade Miquelon who took over as CEO in February 2019. Joann formerly owned by Leonard Green & Partners went public in March with an initial offering price of $12 per share. The company raised $130.8 million with the initial stock offering and now has a market capitalization of $468 million with three-quarters of results recorded as a public company. Third-quarter revenue for Joann totaled $496 million about one-quarter the size of Michaels.

Hobby Lobby and Joann have locations in Northwest Arkansas but Michaels does not. The closest Michaels stores are in Fort Smith and Joplin Mo.

Buchanan said the company has not ruled out a future location in Rogers at some point but the focus is on growing online sales and running more efficient stores. He said the company is trying to get away from high/low discounting and move to a loyalty program targeted to makers its core customers.

The position had its challenges — don’t seat too many people in one section or that server will be slammed but don’t underseat in another or that server will hate me — but the worst part was that through lulls and through rushes I had to stand up.

I’d clock in and take my position at the podium near the door. For the remainder of my shift there I was: standing sometimes for seven or eight hours. As I moved through food service jobs in the following years I began to think of work as consisting of two categories: sitting down and standing up.

In a country that hasn’t raised its federal minimum wage since 2009 the right to sit down may not be at the top of the list of workers’ demands but for many who are subjected to arbitrary standing for hours on end it is certainly on the list. While there are downsides to sitting-down jobs (as any office worker will tell you it’s not great on the body or the mind to spend day after day hunched over a computer screen) the pointless discomfort of having to stand while performing work that could easily be done from atop a stool or a chair is particularly grating.

Cashier is one of the more obvious such positions. In the United States most grocery stores require cashiers to stand at their checkout station. Merely leaning against a surface can bring repercussions — as many a manager has irritatingly put it “If you have time to lean you have time to clean.” The subject comes up every once in a while when a social media post about the issue goes viral. One such tweet for example reads “Honestly the fact that American supermarket cashiers don’t get to sit down (?????) is sufficient grounds for revolution by itself.”

A notable exception is ALDI which allows cashiers to sit down. The chain is German-owned — in Europe it is common practice for cashiers to be seated. Yet ALDI which has around two thousand stores in the United States is ruthless in its pursuit of high productivity and low labor costs; it allows cashiers to sit because its data suggests this arrangement boosts speed. The chain monitors cashiers’ rate on the register pushing them to scan more than one thousand items an hour and leaving customers to bag their own groceries. It staffs at low levels with workers responsible for a range of tasks during the shift and the chain’s practice of slapping many barcodes on every item is a means of speeding up the checkout process too. ALDI requires customers to cough up twenty-five cents to get a shopping cart (they do get their quarter back when they return the cart) saving the chain the labor cost of having workers round up scattered carts in the parking lot.

Rather than expecting an employer to adopt the right to sit out of its own goodwill standards are emerging through class action lawsuits. California’s Supreme Court broadened a right to sit down in 2016 after CVS Pharmacy cashiers and JPMorgan Chase bank tellers sued their employers for violating the state’s wage orders which provide that “all working employees shall be provided with suitable seats when the nature of the work reasonably permits the use of seats” a regulation originally adopted in 1911 to apply to women working in retail. The cases were brought through the Private Attorneys General Act which provides workers with a private right of action against employers for labor code violations.

In Kilby v. CVS Pharmacy Inc. workers argued that the phrase “the nature of the work” refers to discrete tasks such as ringing up items and that seating should be provided as an option when those tasks are being performed. This was in contrast to employers’ desire for a more wide-ranging determination of the phrase one that takes into account all the activities a worker performs during her shift as well as the boss’s judgment and the layout of the workplace.

While the court did not entirely agree with the workers it ultimately came down closer to their side ruling that employees cannot be denied a place to sit solely because an employer prefers that they stand. “There is no principled reason for denying an employee a seat when he spends a substantial part of his workday at a single location performing tasks that could reasonably be done while seated merely because his job duties include other tasks that must be done standing” wrote Justice Carol A. Corrigan.

California workers have brought class action lawsuits against several employers since the ruling. In 2018 Walmart agreed to pay $65 million to 100000 cashiers in California for violating the standard. Despite agreeing to provide suitable seating going forward the megacorporation has since been sued once again by workers who say it has not done so. Bank of America too settled a lawsuit by its California tellers for $15 million while Safeway settled a case for $12 million.

So long as workers are told to stand when they could sit the issue will continue to be one of the many frustrations of working in the United States. It needn’t be. If California can back workers’ right to sit down there’s no reason the rest of the country can’t do so. Grocery workers have risked their health and safety during the pandemic performing work that was celebrated as “essential.” If there was ever a time to let them take a load off it’s now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6Y2VudHJhbC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3Mvam9icy8yMDIxLzEwLzMwL3Bob2VuaXgtam9iLWhpcmluZy1lbXBsb3ltZW50LWV2ZW50cy82MTg0NjExMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metro Phoenix job hiring events planned for Carmax Walmart mall,"Arizona in September finally recouped all of the private-sector jobs lost during the pandemic as the state's unemployment rate eased to 5.7% the first drop below 6% in a year and a half.

Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort has it all: views of the nightly fireworks over Epcot and Magic Kingdom over-the-top suites a beautiful water park and much more in a perfectly upscale and serene setting.

Travel + Leisure readers voted it the best Walt Disney World Resort area hotel (and the third best resort hotel overall in Florida) in the 2021 World's Best Awards. And after checking it out for ourselves we can totally see why.

The Four Seasons Resort Orlando experience starts the second you begin your drive through the magnificent Golden Oak neighborhood up to the impressive Spanish Revival-style property which first opened in August 2014. Upon entering the lobby you'll notice the first of many refined Disney-inspired touches: a sparkling chandelier that looks like bursting fireworks and a stairwell featuring a hidden Mickey or two. That entryway sets the tone for the resort as a whole. It's on Disney property and offers plenty of theme park perks but it's also true to the Four Seasons reputation for luxury spaces and experiences making it a completely unique upscale experience at Disney World.

The beautifully designed 375 guest rooms and 68 suites include charming one-bedrooms with views of the fireworks from private balconies and the super-luxe Royal Suite that can expand to a nine-bedroom residence (there's even an option to reserve the entire 16th floor — including the hotel's top suites — with the Ultimate Suites Experience and Top Floor Buyout package which includes butler service). And while the rooms are lovely other on-site amenities include perks not found anywhere else on Disney World property adding to the resort's appeal among travelers of all kinds — from couples on romantic getaways to multi-generational groups enjoying a family vacation.

A five-acre water park themed after an elegantly ruined mansion features a lazy river surrounded by lush greenery waterslides a family pool and — perhaps the most exciting part for parents and adult travelers — the only adults-only pool on Disney World property. That's right — adults can consider this dreamy infinity pool overlooking the lake their very own Disney World Oasis complete with food and drink service.

And thanks to the Kids for All Seasons supervised program parents can actually take advantage of the pool relax at the spa (which offers an incredible array of treatments like facials massages cryotherapy IV vitamin therapies and more) or hit the golf course knowing that their kids (ages 4-12) are having the best time with activities just for them in the Mansion. Plus older kids will love playing games and watching movies at The Hideout — a space so cool even adults will want to check it out. And whether you're grabbing a quick breakfast or looking for a special occasion meal there are six dining venues to choose from including the rooftop Capa steakhouse and the poolside PB&G.

With all these amenities it might be tempting to hang out at the hotel every day but we know you'll want to hit the theme parks when you visit. Thankfully there's a Disney Planning Center in the lobby to help with any of your theme park needs and the resort offers complimentary transportation to the theme parks among other Disney perks.

If you want to shop for some new Disney-inspired looks (or just a cute new outfit) there's an expertly curated boutique with a mix of Disney tees accessories and resortwear. There's even a character breakfast featuring Goofy and pals onsite at Ravello.

From the beautiful tucked-away setting and intimate spaces to exclusive experiences with options for the entire family the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort delivers on an extra-magical experience with an unmistakeable Four Seasons distinction.

He also appeared in two of the films that we’ll be covering today where he played the son of one of Disney’s most notable recurring antagonists of the ’60s. Rest in Peace Mr. Kirk.)

Today’s Disney Retrospective is going to be a little different than most of the ones that I’ve done so far since I’m not necessarily focusing on a single franchise. Instead we’ll be looking at a bunch of films that share one thing in common their setting. In the ’60s and ’70s several live-action Disney films were set at the fictional Medfield College which was named after a town in Massachusetts where several friends of Walt Disney lived. Many historians have noted that Walt visited them frequently and often used to land one of his planes on their property on a private airstrip that is partially still around today. So then what films will we be looking at today if I’m not doing a single franchise? Well there are two main series of Disney films that took place at Medfield College. The first of them follows the exploits of a well-meaning but forgetful science professor who creates an incredibly rubbery substance that he calls ‘Flubber’. There were two films made in the ’60s about this character and the original film would end up getting remade in the ’90s resulting in a film that I’m sure many folks of my generation are decently familiar with. The other series of films is a trilogy (plus a 1995 made-for-TV remake of the first film) that centered around a student at Medfield named Dexter Riley notably played by Kurt Russell who tries to help keep the college from falling into financial ruin via various inventions that end up affecting him in unique ways. In fact every single film that we’re about to discuss in today’s retrospective consists of a plot where the main characters try to help the college get out of debt so I apologize in advance if it seems like I’m starting to repeat myself at times. Thus without further ado it’s time to head back to school Disney style as we look at the seven Disney films that were set at Medfield College. This is the Medfield College Anthology.

Also just a quick disclaimer before we begin. While the following 7 titles were the only Disney films that were specifically set at Medfield College another Disney film 1976’s The Shaggy D.A. is set in the town of Medfield which means that it’s technically set in the same location. However since that film doesn’t feature the college at any point I won’t be looking at it today.

ACT 1 – THE FLUBBER SAGA

THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR (1961)

We begin today’s retrospective with one of Disney’s earliest live-action hits The Absent-Minded Professor which was based on a 1942 short story titled A Situation of Gravity by Samuel W. Taylor as well as being partially inspired by Hubert Alyea a chemistry professor at Princeton University who was known for his explosive (figuratively AND literally) science demonstrations. It was one of many classic live-action Disney films directed by Robert Stevenson whose work with the company includes the likes of 1968’s The Love Bug and of course the one and only Mary Poppins. With a pedigree like that it shouldn’t come as that big of a surprise that this film is another well-made family-friendly Disney comedy that features plenty of entertaining sequences that fully capitalize on the concept of a miraculous rubber substance that can defy gravity such as the famous scene where the main protagonist Professor Ned Brainard uses it to help Medfield’s struggling basketball team. Fred MacMurray headlines the film nicely as Professor Brainard as does Nancy Olson as Brainard’s fiancé Betsy Carlisle who he unfortunately keeps forgetting to get married to. This is also notably the first appearance of a recurring Disney villain Keenan Wynn’s greedy land developer Alonzo Hawk who would go on to appear in this film’s sequel and the previously reviewed Herbie sequel Herbie Rides Again. In short despite the usual ‘dated politics’ that are often seen in an older film like this and the fact that it gets a bit meandering near the end despite a modest 97-minute runtime The Absent-Minded Professor is another indisputable classic of Disney’s early forays into live-action films.

Rating: 4/5

SON OF FLUBBER (1963)

Thanks to the success of the original Absent-Minded Professor a sequel was announced not long after its release thus making it one of the first major Disney films to get a sequel. Really though the fact that this occurred at all is quite fascinating given that this was back when Walt Disney was still alive. As anyone well-versed in Disney history will surely point out Walt wasn’t too keen on the idea of sequels famously quoting that “you can’t top pigs with pigs” in response to the idea of doing follow-ups to the studio’s iconic Three Little Pigs short. And to be fair to Walt’s stance on the matter Son of Flubber does often come off as one of those sequels that for the most part simply rehashes a lot of the same beats as its predecessor. You’ve got Professor Brainard’s various experiments and the wacky antics that ensue a scene where he pranks his romantic rival with said experiments and a major sporting event where Medfield’s group of underdogs use them to beat their physically superior rivals from Rutland (only here it’s during a football game instead of a basketball game). There are also a few plotlines that are very much in line with what some sequels end up falling victim to by undoing elements of the previous film’s happy ending such as a love triangle subplot involving an old flame of Professor Brainard’s that ultimately goes nowhere. But for what it’s worth Son of Flubber still manages to be another enjoyable comedic romp thanks in large part to the return of all the major cast and crew members from the first film from director Robert Stevenson to stars Fred MacMurray Nancy Olson Keenan Wynn and Tommy Kirk. Thus while it’s very much a sequel that’s not as good as its predecessor there’s still just enough of all the things that made The Absent-Minded Professor an enduring staple of Disney’s live-action catalog to make this a worthwhile watch.

Rating: 3/5

(Now before we continue I just want to note that there are technically two other Absent-Minded Professor films that served as pseudo-sequels to the original. These two made-for-TV films starred Harry Anderson of Night Court fame as Professor Henry Crawford the late Professor Brainard’s successor as Medfield College’s chemistry professor who rediscovers Brainard’s lost formula for flubber. However due to issues regarding the availability of these films I won’t be covering either of them today. While the 1988 Absent-Minded Professor film can currently be found on YouTube the same can’t be said for its 1989 follow-up The Absent-Minded Professor: Trading Places. At the time of this retrospective’s publication I cannot find it anywhere online and to be perfectly blunt I personally feel that attempting to find it would be too daunting of a process for the sole purpose of covering it here.)

FLUBBER (1997)

Just one year after he wrote and produced the live-action remake of 101 Dalmatians John Hughes tackled a different Disney remake with the remake of The Absent-Minded Professor Flubber. It was also notably the second time that he had collaborated with director Les Mayfield who had previously helmed a different Hughes-penned remake 1994’s Miracle on 34th Street. Overall Flubber is a lot like the 101 Dalmatians remake in that it generally maintains all the main story beats from the original; missed weddings flying cars a big basketball game etc. Likewise any changes that are made to Bill Walsh’s original script outside of making this film’s version of Flubber a sentient substance mostly come in the form of aesthetic differences that are in line with the remake’s more modern setting. For example instead of a loyal canine companion this film’s Professor Brainard is accompanied by a flying robot assistant named Weebo (notably voiced by The Little Mermaid herself Jodi Benson). However despite doing quite well at the box office where it earned over $178 million worldwide ($93 million of that domestically) Flubber didn’t exactly do well with critics. And for the most part this stems from something that I mentioned a few months ago when I reviewed the 101 Dalmatians remake in that this was during a time when John Hughes’ work underwent a considerably noticeable tonal shift. In other words whereas Hughes had made his mark on the industry with his sharply written (and often edgy) comedies his 90’s films were known more for their juvenile slapstick humor and Flubber is undoubtedly a prime example of that with pratfalls and head smacks galore.

And yet even with that in mind I still find this to be an enjoyable watch. Now full disclosure I will fully admit that what I just said is largely stemming from the fact that this is an incredibly nostalgic film for me as I watched it repeatedly growing up (and before you ask I also watched the original a couple of times on VHS when I was younger). That said though I also recognize WHY this one didn’t fly well with everyone (no pun intended) such as the argument that Robin Williams may not have been the best choice for the lead role since Professor Brainard isn’t exactly the most likable protagonist. And yet Williams still manages to find some opportunities to display his comedic talents and all-around earnest persona (even in a role like this that to be fair wasn’t that much different from its 1961 counterpart) because… well he was just that good. Regardless of the quality of the films that he was in Williams’ talent was always able to shine through and serves as a keen reminder of why he continues to be missed to this day. In short if you’re willing to ignore some of the weird narrative updates that Hughes makes to this story (e.g. the subplot involving Weebo’s romantic feelings towards Brainard) and a couple of instances of incredibly dated 90’s CGI Flubber is a relatively harmless remake of The Absent-Minded Professor. The original is still the better film at the end of the day but to be perfectly frank I can’t bring myself to be too hard on what was very much a childhood favorite of mine.

Rating: 3.5/5

ACT 2 – THE DEXTER RILEY TRILOGY

THE COMPUTER WORE TENNIS SHOES (1969)

We now move on from the antics of Professor Brainard to the adventures of Medfield student Dexter Riley originally played by Kurt Russell who for those who are unaware mainly got his start in the business as a prominent male lead for Disney in the ’60s and ’70s. As for the first installment of what is called the Dexter Riley trilogy 1969’s The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes it very much establishes the key recurring beats that would define these three films. Each installment revolves around an incident in which Dexter gains incredible powers from the latest Medfield experiment as he works with Medfield’s bumbling Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) to help win money for their financially struggling school while dealing with the threat of corrupt businessman A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) who also wants to capitalize on Dexter’s newfound abilities. In this first film an electric shock that Dexter sustains while working on Medfield’s newly acquired computer ends up turning him into a walking supercomputer and while this ultimately results in a largely by-the-numbers plot this is still a solidly entertaining family flick that’s fully bolstered by the series’ three main leads. Even in the early stages of his career Kurt Russell successfully showcased the strongly charismatic screen presence that would end up defining him as an actor. Joe Flynn meanwhile provides solid comedic relief as Dean Higgins while Cesar Romero is enjoyably over the top as main antagonist A.J. Arno. As such while it’s admittedly a rather average outing as far as Disney’s live-action filmography is concerned The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes does succeed in being a pleasantly easygoing crowd-pleaser.

Rating: 3.5/5

NOW YOU SEE HIM NOW YOU DON’T (1972)

The lead trio of Kurt Russell Joe Flynn and Cesar Romero all returned for a follow-up in 1972 Now You See Him Now You Don’t. The film also saw the return of the original’s director Robert Butler a veteran director of television who has notably helmed the pilot episodes of several classic shows such as Batman with Adam West (and of course Cesar Romero) and the original pilot for Star Trek that featured Jeffrey Hunter’s Christopher Pike rather than William Shatner’s James T. Kirk. In this film Dexter and his friends come up with a special formula that can turn them invisible. This results in what is quite frankly the most entertaining premise of the entire trilogy especially since this film does a better job than its predecessor did when it comes to capitalizing on the potential of its premise with plenty of fun invisibility-related set pieces such as the one where Dexter helps Dean Higgins win a game of golf. And while some of the film’s invisibility effects have obviously dated quite a bit the whole film in general is better-paced and a lot more consistently humorous than the first film was. All this helps it to overcome another straightforward plot that dare I say kind of feels like it straight-up ignores the events of the previous film at times. In other words there’s not a single mention of everything that Dexter went through in the first film including the fact that A.J. Arno tried to have him killed (which as you might have guessed is not brought up at all once Arno makes his first appearance in the film after being released from prison). Still for what is undoubtedly another one of those often forgotten live-action Disney films from the studio’s ‘darker days’ (especially seeing how it surprisingly isn’t on Disney+ at the time of this post’s publication unlike the other two films in the trilogy) Now You See Him Now You Don’t is against all odds a superior sequel.

Rating: 4.5/5

THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD (1975)

The final installment of this trilogy 1975’s The Strongest Man in the World saw a notable change in direction. This time directorial duties were handled by the brother of trilogy writer Joseph L. McEveety Vincent McEveety whose work we’ve previously discussed on this site via the Herbie the Love Bug retrospective that I did a few years ago as he had directed two of that franchise’s films and a few episodes of its short-lived TV series. Unfortunately this is easily the weakest installment of this trilogy as it’s derailed by some questionable narrative and production decisions. It’s not outright terrible per se as there are a decent number of sequences that properly maintain the kind of wacky scientific antics that these films are known for. However the film suffers considerably from some incredibly weak pacing with some sequences dragging on for way longer than they need to be. Not only that but the film has a surprisingly limited amount of screentime for Kurt Russell as Dexter who’s literally absent for at least a third of the runtime. Instead more time is spent with Dean Higgins A.J. Arno and his right-hand-man Cookie and new characters like Eve Arden and Phil Silvers as the owners of rival cereal companies the former of whom teams up with Medfield to promote the super-strength formula that Dexter and his friends come up with. Now granted this may have had something to do with Kurt Russell beginning to transition into non-Disney projects at this point in his career but nevertheless the severe lack of his trademark charisma is quite noticeable. As such the Dexter Riley trilogy ends up concluding on a mediocre note as The Strongest Man in the World is unfortunately a major dud that’s largely undone by a messy plot that despite having just enough of its predecessors’ most recognizable elements almost feels like it’s from another franchise.

Rating: 2/5

THE COMPUTER WORE TENNIS SHOES (1995 REMAKE)

Finally we conclude today’s retrospective with the made-for-TV remake of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes which first premiered on February 18th 1995 on ABC. This was one of four remakes of classic live-action Disney films that aired on the network during the 1994-95 season with the other three being remakes of The Shaggy Dog Escape to Witch Mountain and Freaky Friday. It also notably served as the directorial debut of Ant-Man trilogy director Peyton Reed who just two years later would helm another made-for-TV old-school Disney ‘remake’ via The Love Bug with Bruce Campbell. But whereas Reed’s Love Bug was admittedly more of a sequel than a remake given the role that the series’ main protagonist Jim Douglas played in it this new version of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes is a more straight-forward remake that like Flubber doesn’t make a lot of noticeable changes to the original’s script. Outside of the usual modern aesthetic updates the only major narrative differences include things like having its main antagonist be the resident genius from Medfield’s rival Hale University (who happens to be 12 years old by the way…) instead of a corrupt businessman and a decently improved role for the film’s female lead and Dexter’s love interest Sarah Matthews. That latter difference is particularly notable seeing how in the original trilogy with Kurt Russell all three films paired his Dexter up with a different female lead who barely factored into the main plot.

In the remake Dexter Riley is played by Kirk Cameron who does a solid job in the role overall even if his version of Dexter is arguably cockier than Kurt Russell’s Dexter was in the scenes from the original film where Dexter’s fame started to go to his head. Still like with any of Lindsay Lohan’s star-making roles a project like this shows that despite Cameron’s current reputation he was a genuinely talented young male lead. Here he’s joined by 90’s comedy mainstay Larry Miller in a scene-stealing turn as the remake’s equivalent of Dean Higgins Dean Valentine and Dean Jones (who of course would then go on to reprise his role as Jim Douglas in The Love Bug two years later) as Hale’s Dean Carlson albeit in a relatively minor role compared to everyone else. As for the film itself I’ll fully admit that there’s not much else for me to talk about as it’s very much your standard made-for-TV film. Despite a few overly campy moments and some plotlines that don’t really go anywhere such as a pair of government agents who think that Dexter’s been responsible for a recent string of high-profile government hacks it’s an enjoyable little piece of 90’s nostalgia. Granted I don’t recall ever watching this when I was younger (although I wouldn’t be surprised if I had) but I do believe that I would’ve enjoyed this as a kid just as much as I did with the likes of classic Disney Channel Original Movies from the ’90s and early 2000s like Halloweentown The Luck of the Irish and Smart House.

Rating: 3.5/5

The macaroni was hot and flavorful with gooey cheese covering every piece. The savory flavor paired perfectly with the sweet barbecue sauce and the pulled pork added the perfect texture to contrast the soft pasta. And that's not to mention the onion-ring topping which took this dish to another level.

Not only is Flame Tree Barbecue's macaroni and cheese arguably the best at Disney World but I'd say it was the best macaroni and cheese I've ever eaten.

There's also a delicious limited-edition option at Epcot

When I visited Disney World in August Epcot was in the midst of its International Food and Wine Festival. The event highlights cuisine from different countries around the world with a few extra stands offering gourmet versions of classic American dishes. The Mac + Eats booth is one of them.

There I spent $5.75 for a truffle-flavored macaroni and cheese dish. While the serving size was a lot smaller than what I'd purchased in Animal Kingdom it was still worth every penny in my opinion.

The dish contained cavatappi pasta small truffle slices and panko breadcrumbs. The truffle flavor of this dish was strong and paired perfectly with the cheesy pasta. I also thought its combination of textures — chewy truffles crunchy breadcrumbs and smooth pasta — was incredible.

This Food and Wine Festival dish is both delicious and inexpensive. Amanda Krause/Insider

If you're hoping to try the latter dish you'll need to visit Epcot before November 20 when the International Food & Wine Festival ends for the season. The Animal Kingdom dish however is available year-round.

Of course there are countless unique dishes worth trying throughout Disney World so macaroni and cheese might seem too simple to order. But if you're considering one of these two options I guarantee you won't regret it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkdy1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vNS1vZi10aGUtY29vbGVzdC13ZHctNTB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1jZWxlYnJhdGlvbi1zb3V2ZW5pcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 of the Coolest WDW 50th Anniversary Celebration Souvenirs,"Your favorite place on earth only turns 50 once.

The pandemic shut down the parks and when things reopened they were very different than what we’d seen before. We’ve seen health and safety measures operational changes and old features and offerings disappear in the past several months — so much so that Disney World is almost unrecognizable!

Health and Safety

When the Disney World parks and resorts first reopened in mid-2020 there were quite a few new health and safety measures in place. For a while we had things like social distancing ground markers and mandatory temperature screenings.

Now there aren’t as many health and safety measures around — it’s mostly just modified offerings and suggestions to wear a mask indoors. But if you’d asked any of us a few years ago about “health and safety” in the parks we certainly wouldn’t have been able to predict the way that things are now!

Resort Perks

Before the pandemic there were several perks to staying onsite at Disney World including Extra Magic Hours an early FastPass booking window Disney’s Magical Express free MagicBands and the opportunity to book the Disney Dining Plan. Now all of those offerings are unavailable or suspended.

Now free MagicBands FastPasses Extra Magic Hours are no more and Disney’s Magical Express are no more. Instead Disney Resort guests get perks like Early Theme Park Entry and Extended Evening Hours (for guests of Deluxe Resorts) as well as first choice at Individual Attraction Selections with the new Disney Genie+ system. One day we’ll see the return of the dining plan but so far no date has been announced.

Entertainment Options

One of the ways that the parks look the most different now is in the entertainment division. Some shows haven’t yet reopened and those that are open currently look pretty different than they did before the closure. Performers are socially distanced when on the stage which requires smaller casts and altered versions of choreography.

This is particularly noticeable at Festival of the Lion King where the formerly 30-minute show is currently missing fan-favorite segments like the tumble monkeys and the flying birds.

Besides the altered performances we also haven’t seen the comeback of some daytime parades or castle stage shows like they were pre-COVID.

Planning

If you’re heading to Disney World soon and you haven’t been in a few years you may be surprised by the way that planning for your day has changed. Now you’ll be doing a lot more digital navigating ahead of and during your trip and the park hours may not be quite what you were used to before the closures.

Disney Genie and Genie+ just launched recently and brought with them an entirely new list of features to navigate. The free Genie feature in the My Disney Experience app will help you with planning your day in the parks as long as you tell it your preferences ahead of time. Genie+ is the paid replacement for FastPass and it’s a bit more complex to navigate but is very similar to the old MaxPass system in Disneyland Resort.

Dining

Another thing that has seen some BIG alterations in Disney World is dining! Nowadays you’ll make dining reservations 60 days in advance instead of 180 Mobile Order is less of a perk and more of a necessity and restaurants may have lower capacities than what was previously available.

Regular character meals are also not back yet with modified versions instead where characters keep a safe distance. And meals with “face characters” haven’t returned in any fashion except for the small appearance that Cinderella makes at Cinderella’s Royal Table. Some buffet restaurants are serving food family style instead.

On top of that multiple new restaurants have opened up in the past few months. The highly-anticipated Space 220 is accepting guests in EPCOT along with the new La Crêperie de Paris in the France Pavilion. And Steakhouse 71 has replaced The Wave at Disney’s Contemporary Resort.

50th Anniversary Offerings

Disney World kicked off its 50th Anniversary on October 1st and it has been heralded by celebrations of varying proportions across all four parks. New entertainment has come to Magic Kingdom EPCOT and Animal Kingdom in the form of two new fireworks shows and a daytime show that you definitely don’t want to miss!

Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure opened officially with the expansion of the France pavilion making a great new addition to EPCOT! And around all the parks you can find more than 150 new snacks and treats to celebrate the special occasion as well as unique decor like the Disney Fab 50 character statues.

Construction

Last but not least let’s discuss construction. If you haven’t been the parks in a while you’ll be noticing more construction walls than you did on your last visit!

EPCOT is in the middle of a massive park-wide transformation and the center of what used to be Future World is now demolished. There are some new additions in the form of the France expansion the new Creations Shop and the reimagined Club Cool location.

The Tron coaster is currently under construction in Magic Kingdom’s Tomorrowland with no set opening date on the horizon. We will however be getting a new coaster at EPCOT on May 27 2022 with the addition of Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind in the former location of Universe of Energy.

And many resorts have seen refurbishments recently with new guest rooms at Disney’s Polynesian Contemporary and Grand Floridian Resorts as well as updated rooms at some of the Value Resorts. Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort got a whole new look to go with the Moana rooms including a brand-new monorail station!

There have been quite a few changes in the last couple of years at Disney World but that’s not necessarily a bad thing! If Disney weren’t constantly trying to improve the parks and resorts we wouldn’t be where we are today.

Multiversus Leak Reveals It’ll Feature a Percentage System Akin Smash Bros. Knockback,"Design documents for the rumored Warner Bros. fighter Multiversus have leaked online. Images of the document were first published on ResetEra where user Sponge summarized information that was recently shared on a Discord server.

It appears that Multiversus is heavily inspired by Smash Bros. and WB is looking to capitalize on the game’s popularity by making a multiplatform iteration of it with its own spin on the genre. It certainly helps that WB has a lot of popular characters in its portfolio.

Apparently Multiversus will feature a percentage system akin to Knockback in Smash Bros. There will also be Smash-style stages.

You can check out the design docs over at Imgur.

A bullet-point summary of the Discord leak shared on ResetEra is as follows:

Finn plays like Coin Battle (think like Steve in Smash where he needs resources in a way)

Shaggy is literally based entirely on Ultra Instinct Shaggy

No sign of Morty in Rick’s moveset

No sign of Big Chungus in Bugs’s moveset

Garnet from Steven Universe and Arya from Game of Thrones are in [This is extremely significant as it confirms that different playtesters had different incomplete rosters. This explains how the Reddit leak Hbox photo leak and now this guy know about characters the others don’t]

Bat Cave Finn’s Treehouse and Schwifty Planet are stages. They have multiple variants but that’s likely the devs just testing which one they want

Every alt is a full costume. Since the game is a WIP some characters have multiple alts and some have none. The alts he saw include Pickle Rick OG Harley Bizarro Superman Cake (female cat Jake) Pirate Tom & Jerry Gentleman Shaggy. VAs change for alts

It’s percentage-based like Smash if that wasn’t already obvious

Rick is projectile-heavy and uses his portal gun leaving portals that allies can go through but not enemies. Also has an AoE attack that turns you into a helpless baby version of the OC

Tom and Jerry is more like Rosalina & Luma with Jerry being Luma except Jerry can’t be hurt. Stuff like an attack where Tom swings a tennis racket and Jerry is the ball

OC is named Rein “maybe”

The Indian fighter on Friday overcame a spirited effort from Grand Prix alternate Jenelyn Olsim to win by unanimous decision in the semi-final round of the ONE Women’s Atomweight World Grand Prix.

Olsim initially used her striking to keep Phogat at the range but “The Indian Tigress” quickly turned to her world-class wrestling and gained control. Phogat began the second round with an emphatic slam and then took Olsim to the mat at will. The Filipina kept it interesting by attacking constantly with submission attempts off her back but Phogat was relentless with her chain wrestling and earned the victory on the judges’ scorecards. With the win Phogat advances to the tournament final.

Phogat said “To all those who’ve underestimated me it’s not easy bringing Ritu Phogat to her knees. I am here to always prove you wrong. I live to win and dare to dedicate my all. The tigress is set to unleash the glory of her passion at the Women’s Atomweight World Grand Prix Championship Final. I’ll make it a firecracker of a stint.”

Phogat now has a career record of 7-1 and will face Thailand’s Stamp Fairtex (8-1) on 3 December. The winner will get a shot at the title against reigning champion Angela Lee.

Fairtex defeated Julie Mezabarba by a unanimous decision in her semi-final round.

Fairtex controlled the distance early in the first round forcing Mezabarba on the defensive with a plethora of kicks and hard feints. The Brazilian tried to close the gap in the second even landing a takedown but Fairtex executed a beautiful sweep and wound up in full mount. The Thai then battered Mezabarba with a series of sharp elbows from the top position. In the final round Mezabarba charged forward with punching combinations but Stamp wisely used the full length of the Circle to keep her opponent at bay.

ST. PETERSBURG Fla. — So your carved pumpkin is beginning to rot is it?

Or maybe you bought a few to simply decorate your home and it's time to get rid of them. There are better ways to dispose of your unwanted pumpkins than trashing them Waste Management says.

Instead of throwing it in the trash and hundreds of pumpkins ending up in landfills experts say compositing or burying your pumpkin can be helpful to the Earth.

Adding a pumpkin to a compost bin can enrich the soil over time because pumpkins count as organic waste. Just make sure to remove any decorations or pumpkin seeds before tossing them in the pile.

Burying your pumpkin is another option many are not familiar with. Waste Management says the ""pumpkins will eventually break down and enrich the soil therefore improving the health of the flowers and plants in your garden.""

Ever thought of donating your pumpkins? Some zoos accept pumpkins that are not rotten. Many zoo animals eat pumpkins and zoos across the nation oftentimes host pumpkin smashing soirees for the animals.

If you live in an area where you don't mind leaving some pumpkin pieces behind in your own yard Mental Floss said cutting the pumpkin into smaller pieces and leaving it for wildlife such as deer squirrels and other small critters can help the environment.

While it may seem easiest to dump the pumpkin in the trash can keep in mind that pumpkins that decompose in landfills eventually emit methane gas according to World Economic Forum which is ""more than 20 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGRlZXIuY2EvY2l0eS1zZXJ2aWNlcy9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC1hbmQtY29uc2VydmF0aW9uL291ci1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtaW5pdGlhdGl2ZXMvZW1wL3dhc3RlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste,"Waste can have a number of environmental impacts including the release of greenhouse gases requirements for large tracts of land and the resources required to collect and process it.

According to a new Wells Fargo & Company survey four in five Asians (81%) live in areas that have experienced some form of natural disaster in the past three years and more than half (57%) live in areas that have experienced severe natural disasters specifically hurricanes tornadoes floods wildfires or earthquakes. Furthermore three quarters of Asian respondents (75%) say they or their families have been directly affected by natural disasters at some point in their lifetime. Nevertheless most Asians (72%) admit they don’t have a detailed emergency plan in the event of a natural disaster.

Among those who do not have a detailed natural disaster emergency plan 46% say they haven’t gotten around to it 40% say it’s because they’ve never thought about making one and 39% say they are focused on more immediate issues. Only 15% say they don’t know how to prepare.

“The survey affirms a lack of physical preparedness as well as financial readiness for emergencies for most people” said Rullah Price head of Public Affairs Resiliency & Enterprise Incident Communications. “Given that over two-thirds of those surveyed said they would like their bank to proactively help them plan for a natural disaster I believe there’s an opportunity for Wells Fargo to educate and inspire people to make some changes for the better – starting now.”

When asked about planning style:

43% called themselves a Good Enough planner who has adequate plans in place.

42% described themselves as a Barely Covered planner who has very thin and non-specific emergency plans.

13% called themselves an Avoider who has not thought at all about emergency planning.

Only 2% described themselves as a Super Planner who is prepared for every possible natural disaster and emergency.

The national online survey of 2226 adults was conducted by Ipsos on behalf of Wells Fargo. The survey included 124 adults of Asian/Pacific Islander origin. The poll was conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 3 2021.

Plans often incomplete

The survey found that those who do have an emergency plan (28% of Asians) prioritize having food and water supplies (83%) access to important documents (72%) emergency cash (70%) and a plan for their medical needs (60%). Items of slightly lower priority include a shelter plan (47%) a family communication plan (45%) a plan for their pets (40%) or a planned transportation/evacuation route (37%).

“Most people’s plans are lacking in detail. It’s necessary to really think through all the possible scenarios. For example only 23% of respondents have outlined specific plans for members in the household of different ages. This is incredibly important for vulnerable ones like children and seniors” added Price.

Only half of all Asians (52%) say they would be prepared if a natural disaster left them without electricity for two weeks. Among those with an emergency plan in place less than a third (31%) said they’d assigned responsibilities for helping others in their plan.

Most not financially prepared

In addition to lacking a physical plan most Asians also are not financially prepared for disaster. The study found that less than half (48%) have started an emergency savings account and many do not keep enough cash on hand. 37% say they have no emergency cash in the house and another 7% have $100 or less in cash at home.

“We are evolving to a cashless society—but during an emergency cash is what’s needed” said Price. “In times of natural disaster you may not have easy access to an ATM and credit cards may not work if electricity is out. It’s important to be prepared for all possible events.”

The study found that only 34% have a consolidated file of important records and receipts safely stored digitally and in a waterproof fireproof container. Also 53% have recently reviewed insurance policies to ensure they have the right types and amounts of coverage.

“It’s important to contact a qualified financial counselor to help organize your finances for an emergency” said Price. “One in five respondents have done this.”



Attention to details matter

“It was surprising to learn that over two-fifths (44%) of respondents have a go-bag packed in case of natural disaster and almost half of those with cars (47%) do not keep their gas tanks filled halfway for emergency evacuation” said Price.

Additional findings on preparedness

More than half (56%) have an emergency kit that includes supplies that will last for several days after a disaster for everyone living in their home.

52% have a 2-week emergency food supply in their home.

47% report that their important documents are not easy to find in their house.

More than a quarter (28%) have documented possessions by taking photos and videos of their house and household items in case they need to make an insurance claim.

Communication is key

Although most Asians are likely to be directly affected by natural disasters at some point in their lifetime less than a third (30%) have had a conversation with family members about how they would locate each other if they were separated during such an event.

The survey revealed that only a third of parents (34%) have discussed the possibility of disasters with their school age children less than two out of five parents (39%) have made plans for school age children in case the parents can’t get home and just 14% have discussed disaster plans with their neighbors or community.

“There have already been multiple natural disasters including wildfires hurricanes flooding earthquakes and winter storms in the U.S. this year” said Price. “Because a natural disaster can occur in any region at any time it’s crucial to have a detailed emergency plan and communicate with your family how you will prepare and protect one another.”

About the Survey

He's looking for answers about the Bloody Benders. • Kansas Reflector,"CHERRYVALE — The chain of low hills known as the Bender Mounds extends in a diagonal seven miles northeast of here islands of limestone and scrubby trees over level fields where this time of year soybeans have just been harvested. The lonely hills meander across what is now U.S. Highway 400 where travelers whoosh by in comfort at 65 mph.

But 150 years ago the rugged Osage Trail ran between these mounds somewhat north of the present highway. This section of the trail ran the 47 miles from the Osage Mission at what is now St. Paul to Independence Kansas and food and lodging was hard to come by. Tired and hungry travelers would sometimes stop for a hot meal and a hard bed at the Bender Inn a two-room frame cabin on the south side of the trail between the mounds.

Many of the travelers were never seen again victims of a multiple-murdering frontier family that has gone down in history as the Bloody Benders. The Bender saga is a thoroughly American crime story full of mystery and gore and their story is as famous in its way as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral or the killing of Billy the Kid. But the enduring mystery behind the Benders is what happened to them. They vanished into history and became the stuff of nightmares — and books television shows and movies.

“I bought it because I love history and would like to find out where (the killings) happened” said Bob Miller a Wells Fargo financial adviser from Independence Kansas who now owns the parcel where the Bender cabin is believed to have stood.

For 65 years Miller said the land was owned by a family who farmed it out and had little interest in its history. No search of the property for the location of the cabin or graves was formally conducted at least not that anybody could remember. When the property came up for auction last year through Indiana firm Schrader Real Estate and Auction Co. Miller knew he had to bid on it.

Miller won by purchasing a package of parcels that included the Bender site. He declined to disclose how much he paid.

“I really like history a lot” he told me. “I’ve never had an acre of land before. Somewhere somehow some way I’m going to get some kind of expert investigation going there. The whole thing is just so bizarre and one of America’s first documented mass murders.”

Miller grew up on tales of the Benders and often visited the old historical museum in Cherryvale where a replica cabin stood and the town celebrated “Bender Days.” The story is the kind of gruesome stuff that has fascinated kids for generations especially Kansas kids like me.

“Between 1870 and 1873 several travelers who disappeared between Independence and Osage Mission were traced to within a few miles of the Bender Mounds” according to the WPA guide to Kansas published in 1939. “So many stories of mystery murder and the supernatural were associated with the area that cautious persons would go long distances to avoid it.”

By all accounts the Benders were a strange lot. There were four of them including an older couple named John Sr. and Kate and a younger couple also named John and Kate. They had come from St. Louis in 1870-71 to join a small community of Spiritualists part of a movement that flourished after the carnage of the Civil War and maintained it was possible to talk to the dead.

Though stories of strange experiences at the inn had circulated throughout the community since its establishment few had given them credence. After the discovery though such tales seemed more plausible. Neighbors reported violent behavior strange séances and narrowly escaping with their lives. – Kansas Historical Society

The older Benders were described as unpleasant and spoke mostly German. But the younger Benders were different. They may have been brother and sister or perhaps common law husband and wife. John Jr. was strong and handsome. But it was young Kate that attracted the most attention a red-haired 20-something who was a trance medium advertised herself in local newspapers as “Prof. Katie Bender” and who claimed supernatural powers to heal.

By May 1873 the mystery of the missing travelers would be solved.

A search party found the Bender cabin deserted and their livestock untended. In an orchard out back they found the remains of between eight and 11 bodies —it was difficult to determine exactly how many but at least one was a child — and a trapdoor in the floor of the cabin that led to a bloody cellar rank with blood and gore.

“Though stories of strange experiences at the inn had circulated throughout the community since its establishment few had given them credence” according to the Kansas Historical Society. “After the discovery though such tales seemed more plausible. Neighbors reported violent behavior strange séances and narrowly escaping with their lives.”

It was theorized that victims were forced to sit at a table with their backs against a stained canvas curtain and while distracted by Kate — who gets most of the blame in traditional accounts — were dispatched by a hammer blow to the back of the head. After being shoved through the trap door into the bloody cellar they may have been finished off with a knife across the throat. The motive was robbery as travelers often carried large amounts of cash to buy land and cattle.

But nobody knows for sure what happened in the cabin. Those who did know ended up dead or disappeared.

When the Bender site went up for auction last year it renewed my interest in the bloody family. Stories about the upcoming auction ran in news outlets around the world. Not having the means or frankly the will to own such a site I submitted no bid. But after the sale I did contact the auction company a couple of times asking to be put in touch with the new owners. Unsurprisingly the auction company did not respond to my requests.

But I lucked out last weekend when I visited the Cherryvale Historical Museum. The museum used to be downtown but it’s now in what was once a private residence and is open 1-4 p.m. on Sundays. The replica Bender cabin that used to be at the old museum is long gone. Cherryvale doesn’t celebrate Bender Days anymore either.

The museum still has three hammers taken from the Bender property shortly after the crimes were discovered and I wanted to see them. They were there in a cabinet behind bulletproof glass that has become hazy with the passage of the years. They were difficult to photograph so I asked if the case could be opened.

No dice I was told.

But the kind woman who was tending the museum that day suggested I contact local historian Carol Staton who knew more about the Benders than just about anybody in town. So I did and had a pleasant conversation with Staton about a particularly unpleasant crime. Then I asked if she knew who had bought the land at auction.

Why yes she said. It was a friend of hers in Independence. She gave me Bob Miller’s name.

Miller told me he hasn’t done anything with the land since buying it in February because he just hasn’t had the time. He would like to investigate the site he said. It is undoubtedly the piece of land the cabin was on but the actual location of the cabin and the orchard have been lost over the years. Because he has a keen interest in history and a respect for doing things right Miller said he’d like to partner with a team of professional archaeologists perhaps from a Kansas university to do a ground-penetrating radar study and possibly undertake excavations.

There may be more to the Bender story than we know he said. Finding the location of the cellar abattoir or the orchard cemetery may lead to discoveries that were not possible with 1870s technology. Some of the victims were never identified.

“If we could find some stuff” Miller said “some bones or maybe teeth that would allow for DNA matching with living relatives.”

The Benders were discovered when the relative of a victim went searching in 1873.

Col. Alexander York a state senator and Civil War veteran wanted to find his missing brother physician William York. Dr. York who had disappeared on the Osage Trail.

Scouting the trail with a posse of 15 or so men Col. York called upon the Bender Inn. The Benders said yes the doctor had been there but he had left unharmed. Kate suggested the story goes that for a price she could use her clairvoyant powers to help locate the missing man. The colonel left but suspicion lingered.

The cabin was later found deserted. The discovery of the bodies including that of Dr. York followed.

A wagon and team belonging to the Benders was later located abandoned near Thayer and a clerk at the depot there said four individuals matching the family’s description had bought tickets and boarded a train to Humboldt. That’s the last real clue we have as to the murderous family’s fate even though the governor of Kansas at the time offered a $2000 reward for their capture.

Over the years tales have placed the Benders in Canada in St. Louis and even escaping — however improbably — in a hot air balloon. These stories have continued unabated and as recently as 2013 amateur sleuths claimed to have solved the mystery of the Benders including one theory that young John and Katie lived the rest of their lives in Colorado and are buried in plain sight at Glenwood Springs.

None of these are convincing to me.

The two theories that seem most likely are that the Benders successfully escaped to parts unknown or that they were lynched by locals and buried in secret. The former is more probable as it’s been my experience that people have a hard time keeping a secret — and a secret as big as the fate of the Benders couldn’t be kept by a group for 15 minutes much less a century and a half.

“It’s just a mystery that keeps perpetuating itself” Staton the local historian said.

After the bodies were found in 1873 the cabin was ripped apart board by board until nothing was left. In time all visible traces of the Bender place disappeared at the mound just as the Benders themselves disappeared. – Max McCoy

After the bodies were found in 1873 the cabin was ripped apart board by board until nothing was left. In time all visible traces of the Bender place disappeared at the mound just as the Benders themselves disappeared.

Staton said she has visited the site or at least peered at it from the public road. An individual on the museum board she said has sometimes led private tours out to the Bender Mounds and this persuaded the board to consider hosting day trips.

Miller said he has no plans to open the site to the public as yet because he wants professionals to survey the location first.

On my trip to Cherryvale last weekend I drove out to the Bender Mounds. I’m not going to reveal the precise location of the site because like Miller I fear a loss of historical data beneath a crush of uninvited visitors. I can tell you that the roads around the site are poorly maintained and that some are impassible in wet weather without a four-wheel drive vehicle. On one half-mile stretch of road my Jeep was nearly up to its axles in mud.

A few miles away from the site at the rest area where U.S. Highway 400 meets U.S. Highway 169 is a state historical marker about the Benders. It doesn’t give the location of the site just saying it is near.

The narrative on the marker indicates how attitudes toward the Benders have changed over the years at least among historians.

The text on the marker as originally provided by the state historical society described Kate Bender as “a beautiful voluptuous girl with tigerish grace” and “the leading spirit of the murderous family.” The description was typical of most narratives about the Benders and in 1970 is what led Samuel Goldwyn Jr. to openly speculate whom he should cast as the beautiful and diabolical Kate in an intended major release. Jacqueline Bissett seemed a frontrunner.

While Goldwyn’s film was never made there have been smaller films featuring the Benders. In 2016’s “Bender” Nicole Jellen played Kate. There have also been novels and graphic novels most notably Rick Geary’s “Saga of Bloody Benders.” There have been a mountain of nonfiction books the latest of which is “Hell’s Half Acre” by Susan Jonusas set for release in March 2022 which promises to tell us the “untold story.”

The current state historical marker has been edited to omit any mention of Kate as voluptuous or possessing grace tigerish or otherwise. While Kate is an intriguing historical figure there’s just no evidence to suggest she was the family mastermind. Murder is a dull and brutish business no temptress required.

If there is an untold story to be told about the 1873 horror seven miles northeast of Cherryvale chances are it won’t come from a movie or a book. But it just might emerge from the mud at the base of a mound on an otherwise featureless parcel of farmland recently purchased by a local kid who was fascinated by one of the bloodiest true stories in Kansas history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxseW1hZy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzMwL3BpZXJyZS1yb2JlcnRzLXdtbXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pierre Robert Looks Back on 40 Years on the Radio at WMMR,"Pierre Robert’s Long Strange Trip: 40 Years on the Air in Philly

In 1981 Pierre Robert started working at Philadelphia rock-and-roll station WMMR after driving his Volkswagen bus cross-country from San Francisco. Decades later Philly’s most recognizable DJ is still taking requests.

When Pierre Robert took a job at WMMR in 1981 he had no idea that he’d hit retirement age at the same station playing some of the very same music he played way back then. The Gladwyne resident discusses his favorite place in the city unforgettable concerts being Philly-famous and why he refuses to give Guns N’ Roses any airplay.

I have to commend you on the fact that you’re less than 30 minutes late for this interview. In my experience — ­and I’ve heard this about you from multiple other people — you’re perpetually and egregiously late. What’s with the tardiness?

[Laughs] Somebody once sent me an article about a condition where people always think they have more time than they actually do. I probably have that condition though I haven’t been diagnosed by any medical doctor at least not one of any repute.

In all fairness you texted me that you were coming from your acupuncturist who was running late herself. Is acupuncture something new for you?

Over the years I’ve done all kinds of body-alignment-­type things. I have a lot of aches and pains and I go to acupuncture twice a week. And it really works though it makes me a little spacey at the end of each session. So I’ve been driving around looking for a cup of coffee so I could be somewhat coherent for this interview. And every fucking place whether it’s Starbucks or the La Colombe in Bryn Mawr there’s a line out the door. I’m so desperate that I almost went to the local bagel place. But guess what? A 10-person line out their fucking door. Are you kidding me?

Before we go off on any more tangents set the stage for me. It’s 1981. You arrive from San Francisco. These days WMMR is in Bala Cynwyd. Where was it then?

At 19th and Walnut. It took up the entire fourth floor of the Wellington building on Rittenhouse Square. If you come out of the downtown La Colombe and look up to the fourth floor you can still see a fading but present white ’MMR bumper sticker on the outside of the Wellington. Back then at least you could open the windows and somebody stuck it on the outside of the building.

Was Rittenhouse Square the social gathering place that it is today?

It was and continues to be my favorite place in the region. There’s this peaceful magic dome over Rittenhouse Square. You sit on any given bench and see the world go by every kind of humanity floating forth in front of you and there’s something delightful about that.

And what were you playing in those days?

A lot of brand-new rock that’s considered classic today. We had just introduced Abacab by Genesis and Escape by Journey which of course has “Don’t Stop Believin’” on it. And we had just premiered the Rolling Stones album Tattoo You. We somehow got the record before anybody in the entire world had it. So people in Philadelphia heard “Start Me Up” before anybody else.

I know that you lived in the city when you first got here. But you’re in Gladwyne now. Why Gladwyne?

Around 1992 my business manager told me I needed to buy a house. He said I needed to grow up and that I was getting killed in taxes.­ So I started looking around and found this wild house that appealed to my bizarre sense of design a kind of Frank Lloyd Wright 1950s modern house. And once I got settled it was easy to stay here.

My impression of the corporate radio business these days is that DJs are told what to play. How true is that?

It’s true at a lot of places. At ’MMR there has always been extra freedom in varying degrees. On Friday night Jacky Bam Bam does an all-requests show where you might hear Willie Nelson followed by Slayer. During my show I take requests and I have a lot of choices. I call them “left turns.” If something makes sense and I have an instinct to do it then I do it. And while most stations are fully automated overnight ’MMR has a real live DJ all night long. That’s very rare.

“During my show I take requests and I have a lot of choices. I call them ‘left turns.’ If something makes sense and I have an instinct to do it then I do it.”

Have you ever refused to play a certain band or song?

I haven’t played Guns N’ Roses since 2002 when they stiffed the Philly crowd. They didn’t show up for their show at what’s now the Wells Fargo Center. And the crowd broke out in a riot.

Oh I know. I was there in the third row.

Wow seriously? I was not. I heard it was crazy.

Indeed it was. My friend and I latched onto a couple of security guards while people were throwing chairs and trashing sound equipment.

And Axl Rose has never really apologized for that. What they should have done was own it and come back and play a free show. But they didn’t. So I won’t play their music. I’d love to interview Axl about it. My terrain is littered with potholes of my various fuckups over the years but I cop to my own shit and that’s what you have to do.

So you won’t play GNR because they dissed Philly which I respect. What about bands and their political or social stances?

Not that I ever played a lot of Kid Rock but if he had a new song out now I wouldn’t play it because of the insulting anti-gay remarks he made fairly recently. And Skid Row Sebastian Bach. In the ’90s he wore a shirt onstage that said “AIDS Kills Fags Dead.” A possible runner-up would be Ted Nugent. While I actually like him and have done brief interviews with him — he’s very funny and charismatic — his politics have become even more radically conservative and border regularly on condoning violence in support of his beliefs.

You’re a pretty social guy — a bit of a man-about-town in my observations over the years whether it’s the bars downtown or all the concerts you go to. So what the hell did you do in 2020?

That was weird. Quite an adjustment. I did a lot of binge-watching. Whatever shows people were talking about. And I love to read books — spy novels mystery thrillers sci-fi. Escapist stuff. But staying home on Saturday nights was really hard to get used to. I was always out. And yeah I would still go out a bit. Taking drinks outside when the bars were closed inside was okay in summer but it wasn’t so much fun to have a beer that way in February.

Whenever I’ve seen you at bars or shows over the years there are always people coming up to you to say hello which really sends my social anxiety needle into the red. Does that ever faze you? Or do you love it?

I think it’s a blessing. It certainly doesn’t bother me in the least. It’s pretty rare for a DJ to be “spotted.” But that’s the way I built my brand. When I first worked at ’MMR nobody knew who I was. So I’d be out at the clubs where the local bands would be playing — I’m talking about bands like the Hooters which we had in very heavy rotation at the time — and venues like J.C. Dobbs on South Street and the 23 East in Ardmore and I would introduce the opening band and the middle band and the last band and then I’d go around from table to table and shake hands with people. And there were so many appearances at shopping centers. And then you have people like Bon Jovi telling me to come out onstage at Vet Stadium. People get to know you.

How many concerts would you say you’ve been to?

Thousands and thousands. When I was a kid I would go to the casino shows in Lake Tahoe with my parents — ­Sinatra and stuff like that. When I lived in San Fran it was all the Bill Graham rock shows. And so so many in Philadelphia whether I was just going to watch or introducing the show or broadcasting or making some sort of appearance. Philly is one huge concert town. I actually still use this big datebook — one of those huge Franklin Planner kinds of things — with all of the shows in it. The one I’m using now goes back probably eight years. It’s so fat.

And from those 40 years of Philly concerts can you give me three that really stand out?

Number one is absolutely Live Aid. July 13th of 1985. Number two would be the Rolling Stones at the Tower Theater in 2002. That’s the year that the Stones picked some cities and in those cities did a stadium show an arena show and a theater show. So in Philly they did Veterans Stadium what’s now the Wells Fargo Center and a few days later the Tower Theater. And third? I’ll have to think about this one. Hmm …

I’m not going anywhere.

Okay the third show was November 21 2001. The station threw me a 20th anniversary concert at the Spectrum. It featured David Lee Roth Fuel and the return of the Hooters. They had been on hiatus for six or seven years so it was a big deal to me that this was their first show back.

Finally I realize that you’ll hit official government retirement age just before this interview lands on newsstands. Is there any guarantee you’ll actually still be on the air then?

I just signed a deal earlier this year for three more years with a possible two-year extension after that which indicates that I should still be employed when this comes out. Of course there are no guarantees of anything in life.

Published as “Tuning In” in the November 2021 issue of Philadelphia magazine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzEwLzMxL2Nhc3Blci1zbGVlcC10aGUtc3R1ZmYtbmlnaHRtYXJlcy1hcmUtbWFkZS1vZi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casper Sleep: The Stuff Nightmares Are Made Of,"The bedding specialist may be running out of available cash.

Wall Street might be rethinking its bullish outlook for Casper Sleep (CSPR) the promising but problematic mattress maker that's burning through cash in an ambitious bid to grow bigger.

It recently got its main lender to agree to let its cash balances dip far below previously agreed-upon levels while earlier this week it also filed a shelf registration for a mix of stock and debt to raise $150 million.

At least one analyst is having nightmares about the stock as Wedbush analyst Seth Basham lowered his outlook on Casper to neutral from outperform and also slashed his price target from $10.50 per share to $4.

Casper currently trades below that reduced price down 70% from its 52-week high and 40% below where it started the year.

Fevered dreams

Casper was something of a horror show from before last year's initial public offering (IPO). The bed-in-a-box maker had planned to debut on the Nasdaq exchange at a price between $17 and $19 per share but hours before the IPO Casper slashed the offer range to $12-to-$13 per share.

The situation really hasn't improved. Casper is still a loss-generating business posting a $90 million loss in 2020 which was only slightly narrower than the $93 million loss in 2019 and the $92 million one the year before that.

Year to date it's running a deficit of $55 million only slightly less than the $59 million loss it posted through the first six months of last year.

And now it seems to be running out of cash.

Hiding under the covers

In a filing last week Casper said it convinced Wells Fargo to waive the requirement that it had to maintain at least $32 million in cash in its bank account between now and the end of the year to avoid triggering a default notice. Also as long as Casper gives Wells Fargo at least five days' notice it can lower its cash balance below $15 million.

While Casper has been lighting a match to its money before the pandemic or the current supply chain disruptions it's clear that port congestion shipment delays and soaring inflation are going to further eat away at whatever money Casper was stuffing under its mattresses. Poor financial results will haunt investors' dreams for a long time to come.

That's probably why it is looking to raise $150 million through a shelf registration to sell a combination of stock debt warrants and units. That doesn't mean it will raise all that money at once or dilute shareholders (or increase its debt load) immediately: A shelf registration gives a company three years to sell the underlying securities.

What it does indicate is that Casper has a lot worse financial problems than previously believed.

A stock to give you insomnia

The bed-in-a-box niche is crowded and competitive with rivals including Purple Innovation Leesa and Nectar not to mention adjustable mattress maker Sleep Number and more traditional mattress companies such as Tempur Sealy. Consumers have plenty of choices.

But most of them (albeit not all) are profitable and with the cost of raw materials for mattresses and foam beginning to run away and with no end in sight for the logjam of ships backed up in ports around the country the problems for Casper Sleep -- logistical and financial -- are only going to grow.

This past Friday evening Villanova Athletics held Hoops Mania in the Finneran Pavilion celebrating the men’s and women’s basketball teams and getting students excited for the upcoming season with cheers dances and a performance by the famous rapper Offset.

The Finn was packed as students braved the rain and flooded into the Pavilion as soon as the doors opened at 6:00 p.m.

Before the official opening of the event there was a shot competition dance competition and a passionate pump-up speech from the captains of the football team.

Denise Dillon head coach of the women’s basketball team kicked off the event a few minutes after 7:00 p.m. Dillon hyped up the crowd and started a few chants before introducing her coaching staff.

“We have the greatest fans in the Big East” Dillon said to the crowd. “No not just the Big East but the entire nation.”

Each member of the team was announced as she walked onto the court to meet her teammates in the middle. The team’s star player Maddy Siegrist was then celebrated for scoring over 1000 career points. Following this the face of Villanova Basketball Mr. Jay Wright ran onto the court.

GQ Jay continued to get the crowd excited leading the Finn in a few cheers and “Swag Surfin’” practice a dance to the popular song by F.L.Y. that students usually dance to at games before introducing his coaching staff.

“I’m very impressed with your swag” Wright said. He echoed the sentiments of Dillon “We have the best fans in the country.”

Wright then expressed to the students the important role they played in the success of the basketball team. He asked the students to continue to cheer and get excited at games throughout the season.

“We play three games at the Wells Fargo Center on Saturdays this season” Wright said. “Do you think you guys could get up and party a little in the parking lot for us?”

Wright was met with roars of excitement from the crowd as the students readily agreed to his request after missing a whole season of Wells Fargo parking lot pregames last year.

“Just making sure we didn’t forget about that” Wright said pleased with the crowd’s reply. “One of our favorite sights is when we pull up to Wells Fargo at 8:30 in the morning and see you guys already out there partying in the parking lot. It gets us fired up.”

Each member of the men’s basketball team was then announced to cheers from the crowd as they ran onto the court to collect their 2021 Big East championship rings from last season.

The University was unable to celebrate the achievements of the team last year due to the pandemic so after the team gathered at center court the 2021 addition to the Sweet Sixteen banner and both the 2020 and 2021 Big East Championship banners were unveiled.

Following a performance by the University’s dance team the men’s and women’s basketball teams faced off in an intense three-round dance-off. Both teams danced to some crowd-favorites. The women’s team killed a dance to “Gucci Flip Flops” by Bhad Bhabie featuring Lil Yachty and the men’s team blew the crowd away as they ripped off their hoodies while dancing to “Way 2 Sexy” by Drake with Future and Young Thug.

During the three-point competition cheerleaders and members of the dance team ran through the crowd handing out blue and white streamers to students. Students then celebrated the Philadelphia tradition of throwing streamers at the first basket of the season when Brandon Slater completed an alley-oop dunk from Collin Gillespie a few seconds after the tip-off of the Blue and White scrimmage. Streaks of white and blue rained down upon the team from all sides of the Pavilion. Players and staff members were quick to start cleaning up the piles of streamers so the team could continue play.

After the black team won the scrimmage it was time for the dunk contest. Every player received high marks from the judges which included former members of the men’s team and current women’s team players. Brandon Slater was victorious coming off a high of scoring the first basket and won the contest with an impressive dunk over a staff member.

Finally it was time for the main event of the evening the much anticipated Hoops Mania performance by the special guest performer. Students quickly poured onto court trampling over each other. Many students tripped over a small ledge on the edge of the court and their unfortunate mis-steps were shown on @barstoolnova on instagram.

“Be careful!” Wright said imploring the crowd to stay calm as students rushed past him to get close to the stage. “Take your time take your time.”

The men’s team gathered on stage with Wright to announce the performer. A rumor circulating campus that the performer was the famous rap artist Offset turned out to be true so this announcement was met with cheers from the crowd.

“Villanova goes crazy” Offset said as he kicked off his performance with the hit song “Hannah Montana” by Migos a popular rap trio consisting of Offset and two other artists Quavo and Takeoff.

Offset performed several of his hit songs including “Ric Flair Drip” “Clout” and “Bad and Boujee.” The rapper danced with both the team and the University’s mascot yelling at Will D. Cat to “get your a** up here” and join him on stage.

Offset concluded his performance by leading the crowd in “the loudest ‘Offset’ they’ve ever heard” a famous ad-lib that he adds to many of his songs. Students quickly filed out of the stadium and into the chilly October air to continue the evening with their Halloweekend plans.

It was indeed a great night for Villanova."

Real estate investment trust Welltower (NYSE: WELL) is also a partner on the first two Coterie projects.

“Coterie is derivative of a French word that basically means a band of friends or a group that’s interested in working together for something” Atria CEO John Moore told Senior Housing News. “That’s what we wanted to evoke in the name for the brand: This is your home and the group of people that you live with the team that supports you is your coterie.”

The building designs and operating models for the first two Coterie communities are intended to foster this sense of community and social connection while also delivering a new standard of luxury living for older adults in sought-after urban locations.

Coterie Cathedral Hill in San Francisco is the first Coterie community scheduled to open in March 2022. Monthly rates for two-bedroom units in the building will range between $16600 and $27000 — and Moore is confident that Coterie will deliver an experience worthy of that price point including through partnerships with organizations such as Mayo Clinic.

He also is confident about consumer demand for Coterie. Pre-leasing has already begun for the 209-unit building in San Francisco and so far the priciest units have been particularly popular he told SHN.

“There’s this underserved group of seniors who have lived full lives in every way and want to keep doing it” Moore said. “What we’re doing is creating an environment where they can live well and easily do all the things that they love to do.”

The Coterie model emerges

Putting social connection at the heart of the Coterie brand speaks to the value proposition that the JV partners believe will fill a market gap.

Affluent older adults living in markets such as San Francisco and Manhattan have the means to live in luxurious apartments or condos at exclusive addresses and create their own support systems through delivery services and at-home care Moore said.

Coterie therefore needs to offer a more attractive option and that means fostering community among residents and presenting them with experiences and choices that would not otherwise be available.

“It’s affinity it’s options it’s quality” Moore said.

Atria Related and partners such as Handel Architects have spent considerable effort on iterating different designs and operational approaches to meet these goals Moore said.

For instance the team “continually evolved” toward larger units he explained. They recognized that prospective residents want a home and do not want to compromise on features such as full kitchens.

This decision appears to be paying off already. Eighty-year-old Janet Cluff was one of the first people to sign a lease and she did not want to downsize from a full kitchen to a microwave and mini-fridge she told the San Francisco Chronicle.

“Coming from a big house with great views my qualifications were quite high” she told the Chronicle.

A friend of Cluff’s also has signed a lease at Coterie and is pleased to have enough room for a grand piano. Both of their units are on the building’s top floor.

Last week Cluff attended an Atria-sponsored boxing night at the renowned Olympic Club which has hosted several U.S. Open golf championships. This is just a taste of the experiences that will be available to Coterie residents Moore told SHN.

Coterie is striving to elevate even those amenities that are common in upscale senior living. Take the outdoor pool. Because the Coterie building is essentially built into a hillside the pool deck will look right out onto St. Mary’s Cathedral and offer a panoramic view of the skyline and horizon.

And while many senior living communities tout restaurant-quality dining Coterie Cathedral Hill has hired David Lawrence to lead the culinary program. Lawrence trained in Michelin-starred restaurants in London before opening two renowned San Francisco restaurants 1300 on Fillmore and Black Bark BBQ.

Coterie’s approach to health and wellness includes a partnership with Mayo Clinic’s Healthy Living Program. Mayo and Atria have worked together on Covid-19 testing throughout the pandemic and at Coterie will be collaborating on a “wellness vision” Moore said.

To help execute on this vision Coterie staff will receive training from Mayo Clinic Health Living experts in a variety of areas including physical activity nutrition resiliency and wellness coaching according to Coterie promotional material.

Additional partnerships with health care providers for co-located services also are in the works Moore added. And the community will include a memory care component.

Coterie Cathedral Hill’s location will also help facilitate health care as the community is less than a mile away from the recently opened California Pacific Medical Center/Sutter Health Van Ness Campus.

While features such as the pool deck multiple dining venues and the health and wellness spaces showcase the community’s high-end service-enriched environment the Coterie team is focused on ensuring that design decisions support not only a luxurious but comfortable lifestyle Moore said.

For example the Coterie elevators will be timed to stay open longer than usual and the designs call for more elevators than typical for comparable buildings of their size.

High tech high touch

Hiring and retaining staff is challenging but crucial to the success of any senior living project and Coterie Cathedral Hill will need to recruit workers who can deliver a particularly high level of customer service.

Personal style assistants chauffeurs and a technology concierge are among the staff who will deliver “anticipatory service that elevates your everyday” according to the Coterie promotional booklet.

In the effort to attract staff Atria intends to set wages that are comparable to those at five-star hotels and nearby hospitals and the Coterie price point allows for “more options” than in a more typical senior living development Moore said.

In addition to its Michelin-rated chef Atria has hired a general manager for Coterie Cathedral Hill — Michael Pounsberry — who has a background in high-end resorts and hotels.

Pandemic-related volatility in the hospitality industry should aid Atria in the quest to hire top talent Moore said and he also believes that the Coterie model itself is attractive.

“We’re able to attract really talented people who are excited” he said.

Still Atria will strive to drive staffing efficiencies including through the use of technology. The Coterie communities will feature a robust technology suite supporting the resident experience and back-end operations — including Echo Show devices rolled out as part of a new enterprise offering from Amazon.

The Amazon platform should help drive staffing efficiencies by facilitating smoother communication among residents their loved ones and the building’s workforce and enabling staff to document more easily. Other examples of tech include Alice a system frequently used by hotel operators to manage concierge functions.

These sorts of efficiencies give Moore confidence that Coterie can pay competitive wages and offer a multifaceted resident experience while delivering bottom-line results.

“I’m excited about our ability to drive margin in a world where that’s a tough thing to say” he said.

The JV’s future

With the brand formulated and pre-leasing now underway in San Francisco the sales and marketing process for Coterie is now ramping up.

The effort includes a promotion with Food and Wine magazine. While prospects are often given a brochure and snack when meeting with sales teams in senior living Coterie prospects are gifted a subscription to Food and Wine. Each issue that is delivered to this group will include a cover wrap featuring Coterie.

The cover wrap for the Food & Wine 2021 Thanksgiving Issue features information about the David Lawrence-led dining program.

“Sourcing interesting and thoughtful ways to approach this customer base is something I’m proud of” Moore said.

Related also is informing the sales and marketing approach drawing on their experience in urban projects. The JV decided not to open the Manhattan project in stages which means that prospects will be able to tour multifamily units slated for completion before the senior living floors of the building.

“To work with as professional an urban builder as Related creates some options you wouldn’t necessarily expect you’d have” Moore said.

In San Francisco preleasing is solidly within the pro forma and based mostly on word-of-mouth so far according to Moore. Hard-hat tours are underway and the closing ratio for these is “1000%” he noted.

Looking further to the future he anticipates that the pipeline of Coterie projects will be more solidified by the time the Manhattan building opens. And Atria and Related may undertake projects that do not bear the Coterie brand.

The JV was formed to develop Coterie buildings but also to execute smart real estate deals to tap into the rising demand for senior housing as the population ages Moore said.

“In the ‘seniors decade’ who knows what that will bring?” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sree Ranga Aravapalli 54 cashed out his night’s big winnings — about $10000 — in the early morning hours of Tuesday at the Parx Casino in Bensalem when he was spotted with the loot by 27-year-old Jekai Reid-John of Norristown Pa.

Reid-John who did not know Aravapalli followed the exec in his car as he drove back to his quiet affluent neighborhood in Plainsboro NJ according to the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office.

Just after 3:30 a.m. Plainsboro police responded to a report of shots fired in Aravapalli’s typically sleepy neighborhood officials said.

Police found Aravapalli at the scene with several gunshot wounds. He was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead authorities said. Investigators determined that it was an attempted robbery.

A camera at a nearby farmstand caught footage of Avarapalli driving home in the early morning with Reid-John trailing him close behind police told NBC 4. The same camera later caught him driving back.

Reid-John was arrested and charged on Tuesday in Montgomery County Pa. with one count of first-degree murder. The arrest came the same day that Avarapalli’s family and friends mourned at Avarapalli’s funeral service at a cemetery in South Brunswick NBC reported.

Police said that more charges are likely to be filed. The suspect was detained in Pennsylvania where he remains pending an extradition hearing. When sent to New Jersey he will be lodged at the Middlesex County Adult Correction Center cops said.

Avarapelli has been the CEO of Aurex Labs in East Windsor for the past seven and a half years according to his LinkedIn profile.

The CEO of Parx Casino Eric Hausler released a statement in which he said his business is cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.

“We are deeply saddened by the report that earlier this week a customer of Parx Casino was the victim of a homicide at his home after returning from a visit to the casino. We have learned that law enforcement officials have arrested a suspect who followed the victim home from the casino that night.

“Parx Casino has been cooperating fully with local and state law enforcement agencies in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey and will continue to do so. Our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of the victim at this incredibly difficult time.”

Police Chief Frederick Tavener offered his condolences to Avarapalli’s family who was reportedly well known in the local community.

“I want to offer my sincerest condolences to the Aravapalli family for their tragic loss. This is an unexpected and alarming event for their family friends and our entire community” he said in a statement on Wednesday.

Neighbors were shocked at the violence.

“No one wins in something like this. How can the person that did this think they could get away with it? Why would they kill him?” Abhikanit Kar of Plainsboro told ABC 6. “You never expect this. We were shocked when we came to know what happened.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

TeamGroup has revealed its new flagship M.2 PCIe 4.0 gaming SSD the T-FORCE CARDEA A440 PRO. The CARDEA is available in three different storage capacities 1 TB 2 TB and 4 TB as well as with two different heat sink types aluminium and graphene. The T-FORCE SSD is compatible with PCIe Gen4x4 and is backwards compatible with PCIe 3.0 interface. Moreover the CARDEA utilises the latest NVMe 1.4 specification and therefore it supports PLM (Predictable Latency Mode) and RRL (Read Recovery Level) which diminish latency time and enhance QoS as well as the lifespan of the device.

The T-FORCE SSD also features blistering read/write speeds of up to 7400/7000 MB/s and is 15 times faster than traditional SATA SSDs. These fast speeds produce a great amount of heat and thus the T-FORCE SSD is cooled by a newly designed aluminium fin heat sink and graphene heat spreader. TeamGroup claims that the newly upgraded aluminium heat sink decreases the high temperature output by 48% and delays the frequency of speed dropping during intensive operations. Hence the read/write performance of the CARDEA is more reliable than other SSDs.

Furthermore customers can choose the ultra-thin graphene heat spreader as an alternative cooling solution which allows for flexible installation and does not interfere with other components. TeamGroup asserts that the graphene heat sink comprises of thermal conductivity material that improves heat dispersion by 9%.

The CARDEA supports Windows Vista or later and Linux 2.6.33 or higher and comes with a five-year limited warranty. The CARDEA launches in November and starts at US$189.99 for 1 TB with the graphene head spreader and US$209.99 for 1 TB with the aluminium heat sink.

First showcased at the Devolverland Expo last year the game gained its initial hype due to the involvement of Raphael Colantonio (creator of Dishonored and Prey) as the creative director.

Now that the game is closer to being complete they have come out with a first-of-many deeper looks into the gameplay mechanics. Weird West is set to be released on 11 January 2022 on the Playstation 4 Xbox One and Windows PC via Steam.

The trailer throws us into a dark fantasy reimagining of the Wild West where lawmen and gunslingers live amongst fantastical creatures. And this is the kind of tone you’d expect to see from the creator of Dishonored. In this game there will be a total of five unique intertwined journeys from different perspectives jumping from one character to the other until they all converge in the final chapter.

As shown in the trailer the first of five paths starts as bounty hunter Jane Bell who is out to seek vengeance for her murdered son and kidnapped spouse. From the looks of it it seems like each of those primary characters has unique powers ranging from shapeshifting teleportation and alchemy to name just a few.

The trailer also touched upon interactions within the world. Despite taking a 2.5D top-down approach the developers have made sure to add a ton of RPG-like elements to make the experience highly immersive. You can throw items as distractions search barrels for items and place them into your inventory buy weapons carry or bury bodies set things on fire and they’ve even added a dedicated kick-button.

In Raphael’s words “One of our goals with Weird West is for everything that seems interactive to actually be interactive.” As for combat you have stealth takedowns loads of gunplay and what seems to be a clone of the “Dead Eye” ability from the Red Dead Redemption games.

We also get a peek into the character menu screen from where you can access your inventory upgrade abilities add perks and access important documents and the world map. Fast travel is also a viable option to venture not just into previously discovered locations but also the undiscovered ones. Quests are abundant though we only get to see one of them as we pick our bounty target from the town’s notice board.

Overall Weird West looks like a glorious love child of the combined themes of Red Dead Redemption and Dishonored resulting in a fun-filled experience lasting nearly 40 hours. Further updates on the same are expected to come out soon.

The game is currently available for pre-order on Steam and will grant players with a bonus in-game horse named Calamity who will provide extra storage space and some choice essentials.

The OptiNAND technology from Western Digital combines an iNAND UFS embedded flash drive (EFD) with a hard disc drive (HDD) to improve performance durability and capacity. But the question is if such 20TB drives will be available to the general public.

“We will start volume shipments of our 20TB CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technology next month” Western Digital CEO David Goeckler said on a conference call with analysts and investors.

Western Digital’s OptiNAND-enabled 20TB HDDs use the company’s well-known nine-platter 7200RPM helium-filled architecture with energy-assisted perpendicular magnetic recording technology (ePMR).

OptiNAND improves the platform by storing multiple types of metadata data on the EFD rather than rotating media. The technology frees up space onboard and allows the controller to access metadata relating to repetitive runout (RRO) and adjacent track interference (ATI) more quickly resulting in improved performance.

Because the quantity of metadata held on current HDDs is so large shifting it to NAND makes perfect sense in terms of both usable capacity and performance. Furthermore OptiNAND improves the dependability of hard disc drives.

Western Digital’s OptiNAND-equipped HDDs are designed for cloud data centres and companies according to the company. However because OptiNAND is positioned to solve all hard drive performance and effective area density concerns nothing should prevent a user from placing such a drive in a desktop or NAS and taking benefit of all of OptiNAND’s features.

Unlike its SMR-based HDDs however these drives make a lot of sense in this market. Unless of course they’re priced out of reach for the typical enthusiast.",,,

At night the 37-year-old returns to his hotel room to write reports for insurance companies back home in Namibia.

He wasn't even supposed to be part of this Namibia team that is featuring in its first ever T20 World Cup. Williams had retired from the game in 2018 to shift his focus on his business and family but head coach Pierre de Bryun valued his experience so much that he talked Williams out of retirement. Williams ultimately made a U-turn on his decision and is now relishing being part of Namibia's incredible run in the UAE.

""See I retired for personal reasons. Basically just business work family kids and there was a lot more responsibility"" Wiliams recalled. ""So it was personal reasons to retire. I've said it in previous interviews that when you retire it's like a dark place and you always have a feeling in your heart that there's more to offer and when Pierre de Bryun became head coach we had a meeting in January 2019 and he asked me: 'Craig is there a possibility of coming back returning to assist a very young squad?' So I was more than happy to come back.

""I just felt that there was more I could offer. At that stage I wasn't sure how much I could play. I really wanted to try and help the youngsters. But I obviously haven't had injuries and my form has been okay so it has allowed me to contribute on the field as well. So reflecting... [it's] probably the best decision I've ever made. It was a tough decision at the time; I had to leave my work unfortunately the guys...there was no space to play cricket at that level and give that much commitment to cricket and work so it was very difficult decision to come back. It wasn't easy. But in hindsight I'm really glad that myself and my family made that decision to commit again and play.""

Williams was particularly thrilled at the global exposure that Namibia's players have got at this World Cup. He cited the example of how allrounder David Wiese is now nurturing Namibia youngsters by sharing his experiences of featuring in various T20 tournaments around the world.

""Playing a tournament like this especially playing in the last 12...the exposure for our guys has been fantastic"" Williams said. ""At the end of the day we want to see our youngsters and our best players playing around the world because then they will bring that exposure and experience that they've gained back into our squad and teach our youngsters. So for example just having David Wiese - he's played around the world. The amount of experience he's brought back into our change room and the lessons that he's teaching us about how to handle pressure and how to handle playing against the best - it has been fantastic.

""So we're hoping that with the last few games some of our guys can show themselves in the world stage and hopefully pick up some deals around the world and then it will be fantastic if we can get the likes of Gerhard Erasmus and JJ and Ruben Trumpelmanns Bernard Scholtzs - all these guys playing around the world. Still looking for the first Namibian to play in the IPL (laughs). So hopefully after this tournament we can get one of those deals on the table.""

Afghanistan vs Nambia will make for a clash of contrasts especially on the bowling front. Namibia have packed their attack with left-arm seam ( because they don't have as many right-armers ) while Afghanistan's strength is right-arm spin. Rashid Khan and Mujeeb ur Rahman in particular have been lethal at different points during Afghanistan's three matches in the Super 12s. Williams reckoned that Namibia's familiarity with Afghanistan however would help his side in countering the opposition spinners.

""Our conditions back home in Windhoek aren't flat quick wickets; they are quite low and slow"" Williams said. ""So we've done really well in the five series back home before coming to the World Cup against good spin attacks on low slow wickets. So we've put in really good preparation and we've put in extreme amount of analysis into the opposition and we've worked on individual game-plans for each batsman so I think sitting where we are tonight we're in a very good place. Anything can happen in T20 cricket and we've played Afghanistan many many times in the past. We know what they can do - so it's just about on the day being able to handle the nerves and execute plans put in place.

""So in terms of playing spin we're extremely confident against spin. It's just a matter of being able to execute your plan on that day against the best in the world because you know that's who we are playing against.""",,,,,,,,,

A recent academic study suggested that many smart beta fund names are misleading with half of smart beta products being essentially stock market index funds.

The prevalence of potentially misrepresentative names in investment funds has caught the attention of policymakers and regulators: the US Securities and Exchange Commission last year sought suggestions from the public on how to address this issue.

The problem is that there is no generally accepted definition for the term “smart beta”.

Fifteen years ago Towers Watson a consulting firm now called Willis Towers Watson coined the term smart beta to differentiate it from the “bulk beta” available in index funds.

The factor investing and the quantitative communities have since embraced the smart beta label. No wonder as the phrase sells. Who doesn’t want to buy a smart product?

Absent a uniform definition firms can attach the smart beta label to almost anything. At the end 2020 there were 1300 funds in the smart beta universe with total assets of $1.2tn according to Morningstar the research group.

The crucial component in any useful definition of smart beta is breaking the link between a stock’s price and its weight in the portfolio. Any strategy that uses market capitalisation in selecting or weighting securities such as a cap-weighted value index is not smart beta. When we give more expensive stocks more weight in a portfolio we hurt performance relative to valuation-indifferent indices.

Rob Arnott © Bloomberg

The same can be said of many cap-weighted factor strategies including quality or low volatility. Momentum which amplifies the link with price would also not be smart beta under the original definition of the term. An investor is forced to allocate more of their portfolio to overvalued stocks and less to undervalued stocks: a buy-high sell-low approach.

Our research has found that empirically any structure that breaks the link between price and weight outperforms cap-weighting in the long run because the former automatically benefits from a contrarian rebalancing effect that exploits stock price mean reversion. Even a nonsensical or whimsical non-price-based portfolio (darts anyone?) will typically outperform cap-weighting for that reason.

Given the wide-ranging availability of investment vehicles labelled as smart beta — including many that are not at all smart except for the label — investors may want to rely on a few tools and practices both to avoid pitfalls and raise the odds of meeting their long-term investment goals.

First ensure the return premium expected from a smart beta strategy is robust. Factors underlying smart beta strategies should be grounded in common sense and careful academic research. They should add value all over the world and should not rely on a specific narrow definition in order to work. A framework can help investors identify and narrow the range of choices when deciding which smart beta strategies to consider.

Second be sure to counter the behavioural biases of trend chasing and ill-timed buy and sell decisions. During spans of underperformance when instinct says “sell” revisit whether the strategy’s economic rationale remains intact. This reiterates why the strategy was expected to deliver in the first place.

It is also worth querying whether the results of the strategy can be captured in the real world of trading costs and frictions. Various elements of product design such as portfolio concentration turnover liquidity size and number of holdings can affect trading costs with the potential to erode our results.

Third research whether a particular strategy is trading cheap or rich relative to its history. Anything with soaring performance often creates an illusion of superiority while anything newly cheap likely got there by delivering pain and losses which tempts us to buy high and sell low. Also recognise that in a historical test of performance a meaningful portion of past returns may be tied to revaluation changes so any analysis must control for valuation levels.

For investors with long investment horizons and a willingness to tolerate uncomfortable portfolio rebalancing trades smart beta strategies can help achieve investment objectives. Sadly mislabelled fund names and the lack of an aligned definition around these strategies mislead and obscure.

Until smart beta sees more transparency and is more clearly defined these practices can serve to keep us off the rocks as we navigate this fast growing space.

The suit said the arrangement between the airlines reduced the incentive for them to compete in the Northeast and elsewhere and would “cause hundreds of millions of dollars in harm to air passengers across the country through higher fares and reduced choice.”

“This sweeping partnership is unprecedented among domestic airlines and amounts to a de facto merger” the Justice Department declared. It said attorneys general in six states and the District of Columbia were joining in the lawsuit.

The action is the latest effort by the Biden administration to increase competition and limit the power of large companies through antitrust actions. But it comes as airlines are trying to right themselves after the pandemic crushed their revenue and profits. And the two airlines rejected the lawsuit’s premise contending that their partnership in fact helps increase competition against Delta Air Lines and United Airlines and in New York airports.",,,,,,,,,

In honour of this year’s World Chimpanzee Day celebrated on July 14 the Chimpanzee Sanctuary and Wildlife Conservation Trust - a non-governmental organisation that manages Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary on Lake Victoria - tested all the 52 chimpanzees which are kept at the facility.



The COVID-19 tests which were conducted in partnership with the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) were part of the routine annual health examination of the chimpanzees which involved full physical examinations dental checks and a clinical examination.



Dr Joshua Rukundo the Chimpanzee Sanctuary and Wildlife Conservation Trust executive director said chimpanzees share 98.7% DNA with humans and as such are prone to the same diseases that affect humans.



Dr James Musinguzi the executive director of Uganda Wildlife Conservation Education Centre (UWEC) who also doubles as the board chairperson of Ngamba Chimpanzee Sanctuary said the management is exploring all avenues of vaccinating captive chimpanzees.



“Together with Dr Gladys Kalema of conservation through public health and Ngamba Chimpanzee Sanctuary we are trying to get a vaccine called Zoetis to vaccinate all our chimps. However we shall first do trials on the monkeys that we have and observe how they react” Dr Musinguzi said.



He made the remarks on Wednesday while launching celebrations in memory of Zakayo’s birthday which ran for a week.



Zakayo whose name is synonymous with chimpanzees was the known oldest chimpanzee under captivity prior to its death in April 2018.

Dr Musinguzi said UWEC is using Zakayo’s birthday to highlight the plight of the remaining chimpanzees which are gradually losing their habitats to human activities.



Dr Kalema said Zoetis the largest global health company expressed interest in providing free vaccines for the primates notably chimpanzees and some cats in Uganda.



“The vaccine has been used in zoos across the US and whereas it is still under clinical trials we are hopeful about its effectiveness” she said adding that the batch to Uganda will be the last donation by Zoetis before it embarks on selling the drug.



Apart from the 21 chimpanzees at UWEC Ngamba Chimpanzee Sanctuary hopes to vaccinate between 35 and 40 chimpanzees at the island. Dr Rukundo said emphasis will be put on vaccinating chimps that are 10 years and above leaving out the young ones.



He however said a decision to import and later use the said vaccine is pending clearance from the health ministry and the National Drug Authority.",,,,,,,,,,,,
